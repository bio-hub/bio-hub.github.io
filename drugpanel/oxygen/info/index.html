Admission oxygen saturation of &lt;88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level &gt;1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level &gt;200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level &gt;2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. […] Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality.

Of the remaining nine who continued to need respiratory support, seven (77.8%) had iatrogenic preterm deliveries (six by cesarean delivery) for maternal respiratory distress (needing increasing levels of respiratory support without improved oxygen saturation), one had an early term delivery due to PROM, and one, now 30 weeks, has required intensive care with high-flow nasal cannula for three weeks.
