[…] In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)” in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.

Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) is FDA-approved for treatment of cytokine storm associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. […] Here we examined compassionate use of tocilizumab in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. […] We report on a single-center study of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. […] We examined clinical and laboratory parameters including oxygen and vasopressor requirements, cytokine profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels pre- and post-tocilizumab treatment. […] Twenty seven SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients received one 400 mg dose of tocilizumab. […] IL-6 was the predominant cytokine detected at tocilizumab treatment. […] Significant reductions in temperature and CRP were seen post-tocilizumab. […] Oxygen and vasopressor requirements diminished over the first week post-tocilizumab. […] Adverse events and serious adverse events were minimal, but two deaths (7.4%) occurred that were felt unrelated to tocilizumab. […] Compared to published reports on the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2, tocilizumab appears to offer benefits in reducing inflammation, oxygen requirements, vasopressor support, and mortality. […] The rationale for tocilizumab treatment is supported by detection of IL-6 in pathogenic levels in all patients. […] Additional doses of tocilizumab may be needed for those showing slow declines in CRP.
