31944312,Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health.
31987001,Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics.
31992387,Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories.
32004427,With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging.
32007627,This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus.
32017984,Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described.
32020915,It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.
32023681,A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China.
32023682,Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.
32023684,We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.
32023686,Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.
32026148,The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.
32026671,However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.
32027631,Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.
32029004,Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.
32033513,Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B <i>betacoronavirus</i>.
32033514,These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.
32034659,The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur.
32035431,We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.
32036774,Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.
32046815,The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV.
32047895,Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses.
32048163,Control material is made available through European Virus Archive - Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project.
32051072,The present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in national and European research networks.
32051073,An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.
32051074,We report the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient's initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness.
32053470,This case highlights the importance of close coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care of patients with this emerging infection.
32057211,A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
32062875,Dozens of people died in China, and thousands of people infected as 2019-nCoV continues to spread around the world.
32065057,We have described the discovery, emergence, genomic characteristics, and clinical diagnostics of 2019-nCoV.
32066206,On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32074516,As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.
32074550,Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.
32075877,Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.
32077115,The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases increasing every day.
32077440,With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32077441,Herein, we present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.

32088847,The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China's public health and clinical treatment.
32091414,The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia.
32096367,The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons.
32096395,According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV.
32096396,After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines.
32098019,The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network.
32098302,It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.

32213270,The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin.
32213337,The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus.
32215691,The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well.
32216961,The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.
32217113,Timely detection of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection cases is crucial to interrupt the spread of this virus.
32217506,We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries.
32217556,Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020.
32219006,A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February.
32219626,Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers.
32219814,The 2019-novel-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was detected in the self-collected saliva of 91.7% (11/12) of patients.
32219885,Serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend.
32220177,Live virus was detected in saliva by viral culture.
32220181,Saliva is a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control in patients with 2019-nCoV infection.
32221117,The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries.
32221519,Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China.
32221523,All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32222119,The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count.
32222720,The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity.
32222812,ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury.
32222988,Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity.
32222992,Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury.
32223004,Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.
32223179,2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been spreading in China since December 2019.
32223665,Neonates are presumably the high-risk population susceptible to 2019-nCoV due to immature immune function.
32224769,The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) should be prepared for 2019-nCoV infections as far as possible.
32225135,The emergency response plan enables the efficient response capability of NICU.
32226287,During the epidemic of 2019-nCoV, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be based on the actual situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as well as available equipment and staffing, and take into account the psychosocial needs of the families and neonatal care staff.
32226295,Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China.
32226962,The epidemic has been spreading to other areas of the country and abroad.
32227494,A few cases have progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function failure.
32228809,The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to 2019-nCoV.
32229107,A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age, including 5 cases in Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in China so far.
32229322,In order to further standardize and enhance the clinical management of 2019-nCoV infection in children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number of severe cases, we have formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation according to the recent information at home and abroad.
32229605,Since December 2019, an epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has occurred in China.
32229732,How to effectively prevent and control NCP among children with limited resources is an urgent issue to be explored.
32231348,Under the unified arrangement of the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, the Department of Pediatrics has formulated an action plan with Xiangya unique model to prevent and control NCP among children according to the current epidemic situation and diagnostic and therapeutic program in China.
32232230,Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32232423,Purpose To determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.
32232433,Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.
32232648,Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.
32232837,Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.
32233563,The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.
32233876,Results Twenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.
32233973,These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days).
32233980,All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17±4 days (range: 11-26 days).
32234126,Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).
32234127,Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2±2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (≥14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern.
32234465,Conclusion In patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.
32234468,Through literature review and group discussion, Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association formulated an update on the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32235517,The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with pangolins as a potential animal host.
32237160,Currently the main source of infection is NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious.
32237278,The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact.
32237288,People are all generally susceptible to the virus.
32238024,The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak.
32238223,Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases.
32238224,The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death.
32238260,Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.

32267109,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world.
32267209,It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease.
32267220,Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs.
32268019,However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines.
32268454,Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested.
32269893,We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus.
32270477,We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route.
32270581,We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.
32270938,Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.
32271070,The novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has cost a great loss to the health and economic property of Chines people.
32271208,Under such a special circumstance, how to deal with such patients with acute aortic syndrome has become a serious challenge.
32271596,Rapid diagnosis of concomitant NCP, safe and effective transportation, implementation of the interventional procedure, protection of vascular surgical team and postoperative management and follow-up of such patients have become urgent problems for us.
32271599,Combined with the latest novel government documents, the literature and the experiences from Wuhan, we answered the above questions briefly and plainly.
32271601,It also hopes to inspire the national vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in vascular surgery and even routine vascular diseases with NCP, as a final point to limit the severe epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of NCP.
32271602,新型冠状病毒肺炎对我国人民的生命健康和经济财产造成了巨大的损失。
32271724,在这样的特殊形势下，如何应对主动脉急症患者成为了一个严峻的挑战。
32272080,快速诊断患者是否合并新型冠状病毒肺炎、安全有效地转运患者、实施合并肺炎患者的介入手术、保护血管外科医疗团队，以及对患者的术后管理和随访等，都成为血管外科医师亟待解决的问题。
32272262,结合最新的国家政策、文献报道和个人所在单位支援武汉的防控经验，本文对上述问题进行了简要阐述，希望引发全国血管外科医师对新冠肺炎疫情下如何实施血管外科危重急症乃至常规血管疾病诊疗的思考，共同应对疫情，并在最大程度上将疫情的损害降至最低。.
32272857,At the end of 2019, pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city, China.
32273490,Many airline travelers moved between Wuhan and Japan at that time, suggesting that Japan is at high risk of invasion by the virus.
32275128,Diagnostic systems for 2019-nCoV were developed with urgency.
32275257,Two nested RT-PCR assays and two real-time RT-PCR assays were adapted to local Japanese conditions.
32275288,As of 8 February 2020, the assays developed have successfully detected 25 positive cases of infection in Japan.
32275452,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China.
32275742,Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China.
32275766,The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future.
32275784,The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern.
32275978,The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics.
32276051,To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation.
32276116,The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation.
32276755,We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S.
32276930,Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs.
32277022,The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.
32277387,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread.
32277408,We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32277490,Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed.
32277763,An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years.
32277845,All patients were community-acquired cases.
32277967,Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities.
32278065,Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients.
32278175,Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients.
32278764,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare.
32279934,Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding.
32280076,Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients.
32281327,Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P &lt; .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P &lt; .001) patients after hospital admission.
32281328,Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P &lt; .001).
32281329,Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis.
32281331,Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32281333,Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.
32281335,In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge impact on China and the whole world.
32281391,For patients with lung occupying lesions, the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due to the epidemic.
32281667,For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention should be very carefully considered.
32281668,All thoracic surgeons in China should work together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic changes and further understanding of COVID-19.
32281757,Here, we only offer some preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and discussion.

32283141,Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide.
32283185,With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed.
32283268,Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
32283498,Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection.
32285293,Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention.
32285338,The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned.
32285862,During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19.
32285949,Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients from COVID-19.

32294077,Complying with overall requirements of the government and regulations on public health emergences, as well as the clinical features of diagnosis and treatment of dental illness, this paper refers to previous guidelines and studies on the infection prevention and control in dental diagnosis and treatment in China and foreign countries.
32294796,Nanjing Stomatological Hospital has implemented the emergency management practices for the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), mainly focusing on the implementation of prevention and control training programs for medical staffs and the infection control projects on the hospital environment.
32294816,This study could provide reference for rapid response and emergency management for the prevention and control of NCP in the departments of stomatology.
32294858,本文根据国家有关新型冠状病毒感染防控要求和突发公共卫生事件应急条例，以及口腔专科的临床诊疗特点，参考国内外口腔诊疗中感染防控相关指南和文献，结合医院疫情期口腔诊疗中感染防控的应急管理工作举措，提出应对此次新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期医院感染防控的建议，重点聚焦疫情期医务人员防护培训及医院感染防控落实等方面，旨在为口腔专科在疫情发生期快速应对新型冠状病毒感染防控的应急管理提供参考。.
32295188,In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread across China and beyond.
32295322,On February 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32295323,Since most COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT imaging patterns, radiological examinations have become vital in early diagnosis and assessment of disease course.
32295324,To date, CT findings have been recommended as major evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China.
32296473,This review focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while highlighting the role of chest CT in prevention and disease control. <i>A full translation of this article in Chinese is available.</i>
32296826,Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is currently raging in China.
32296837,It has been proven that NCP can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients.
32296940,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, now it is a difficult task that with the premise of how to maximize the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, we can provide the highest quality medical services to ensure the orderly development of previous clinical work.
32297723,Referring to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for NCP (Trial Version 4 and 5)&quot; and combining the actual practice situation in our hospital with the &quot;Summary of New Coronavirus Files of Shanghai Renji Hospital&quot;, we summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the NCP epidemiology, meanwhile under such situation aiming the procedure of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, we share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32297868,More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments.
32297981,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32298029,The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
32298139,(2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of NCP to patients and doctors.
32298149,Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.).
32298250,If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed NCP, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended.
32298676,(3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed NCP should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under-5 Pa) must be separated.
32299200,All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.
32299201,(4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with NCP must be protected by three-level.
32299304,After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.
32300101,We hope our &quot;Renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues.
32300673,新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）目前正在我国肆虐。
32300823,已经证实，新冠肺炎存在明显的院内感染现象，给外科医护人员和住院患者造成严重威胁。
32300968,虽然结直肠外科并不是此次抗击疫情的一线学科，但在特殊的形式下，如何最大限度地在保护患者、家属、医务工作者自身的健康以及病区和医院医疗安全的前提下，为患者提供最优质的医疗服务，保证以往临床工作的有序开展，是当下的艰巨任务。
32300971,笔者参照《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第四版)》和《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第五版)》，结合本院《上海仁济医院新型冠状病毒文件汇总》的实际工作情况，总结了新冠肺炎疫情防控形势下，如何开展结直肠外科临床工作，分享了如何在疫情防控情况下，针对结直肠肿瘤急诊患者的诊疗流程、对结直肠肿瘤的诊断和准备择期入院手术结直肠癌患者的处理、病房的防护、围手术期的管理等，更重要的是详细介绍了疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术及围手术期的管理，包括医务人员及手术室、手术器械的防控措施。
32301099,其中特别强调的包括：（1）多学科诊疗模式(MDT)应贯穿于结直肠肿瘤整个诊疗过程，MDT成员中，除常规相科室外，呼吸科和感染科也需列入。（
32301155,2）肠镜检查有可能导致患者交叉感染，对操作人员和护理人员也存在较大风险，故仅优先对于可能危及生命的急诊患者（出血、梗阻、消化道异物等）进行；若疑似新冠肺炎患者，不采取内镜下减压措施，直接拟定急诊手术治疗方案。（
32301198,3）疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者应放置于隔离病室，配备单独医疗器具，在指定的独立负压（-5 Pa以下）手术间完成手术；围手术期伤口换药等使用过所有一次性物品、体液、粪便等，均按医疗废物规范进行处置。（
32301478,4）参加疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术的医护人员应实施三级防护，术后应隔离进行&quot;医学观察&quot;14 d。
32301631,希望能对同道有所助益。.
32301646,Public health emergencies have an impact on the public mental health.
32301647,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in oral medical institutions across the country.
32301692,Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases.
32301745,Through literature review, this paper reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to patients' psychological state, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on.
32301749,It was believed that these patients might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and dental specialists should pay more attention to them.
32301761,At the same time, this paper analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with different oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists.
32301997,From the perspective of social role, dentists not only played the role of expert in dental home professional guidance, but also played the role of psychological counseling for patients.
32302058,突发公共卫生事件可对公众心理产生影响。
32302277,新型冠状病毒疫情爆发影响了全国口腔医疗机构正常开展诊疗服务，口腔门诊延期等应对措施可对口腔疾病患者的体验、认知、治疗和康复等方面产生潜在影响。
32302284,本文通过文献复习，对口腔黏膜病、颞下颌关节病、磨牙症、牙周病等与患者心理状态密切相关的口腔心身疾病进行回顾，认为这些患者可能更容易受到应激事件的影响，需要口腔专科医师提高关注度。
32302459,同时分析了不同口腔疾病患者可能出现的心理应激症状，为口腔医师远程咨询和急诊接诊提出建议。
32302675,疫情期间口腔医师不仅承担了口腔专业指导的专家角色，还承担了帮助患者进行心理疏导的角色。.
32302813,To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China.
32302927,Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19.
32302956,Comparisons between the viruses were made.
32303564,Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
32303575,Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.
32304191,Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.
32304192,The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.
32304276,We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.
32304371,Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.
32304643,<b>Objective:</b> To raise awareness about 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and reduce missed diagnosis rate and misdiagnosis rate by comparing the clinical characteristics between RNA positive and negative patients clinically diagnosed with NCP. <b>Methods:</b> From January 2020 to February 2020, 54 patients who were newly diagnosed with NCP in Wuhan Fourth Hospital were included in this study.
32305025,RT-PCR method was used to measure the level of 2019-nCov RNA in pharyngeal swab samples of these patients.
32305181,The patients were divided into RNA positive and negative group, and the differences of clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics were compared. <b>Results:</b> There were 31 RNA of 2019-nCov positive cases, and 23 negative cases.
32305269,Common clinical symptoms of two groups were fever (80.64% <i>vs.</i> 86.96%) , chills (61.29% <i>vs.</i>52.17%) , cough (80.64% <i>vs.</i>95.65%) , fatigue (61.30% <i>vs.</i>56.52%) , chest distress (77.42% <i>vs.</i>73.91%) .
32305884,Some other symptoms were headache, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
32305937,The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive protein, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement.
32306015,There was no statistically significant difference in other clinical characteristics except for dyspnea between two groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> RNA positive and negative NCP patients shared similar clinical symptoms, while RNA positive NCP patients tended to have dyspnea.
32306047,Therefore, we should improve the understanding of NCP to prevent missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis; In addition, more rapid and accurate NCP diagnostic approaches should be further developed. <b>目的：</b> 比较临床诊断新型冠状病毒肺炎（novel coronavirus pneumonia，NCP）核酸检测阳性与阴性患者临床特征的差异，以提高对NCP的认识，降低漏诊及误诊率。
32306118,<b>方法：</b> 选取2020年1—2月武汉市第四医院临床诊断的54例NCP患者，根据实时荧光RT-PCR检测咽拭子标本的2019新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）核酸检测结果分为阳性组和阴性组，比较两组的临床症状、实验室及影像学检查的差异。
32306500,<b>结果：</b> 2019-nCoV核酸阳性组患者31例，阴性组23例；阳性组和阴性组主要临床症状均为发热（分别为80.64%和86.96%）、畏冷寒战（分别为61.29%和52.17%）、咳嗽（分别为80.64%和95.65%）、乏力（分别为61.30%和56.52%）、胸闷（分别为77.42%和73.91%），其他症状包括头痛、肌痛、呼吸困难、腹泻、恶心呕吐等。
32306656,两组患者实验室检查特点主要为淋巴细胞计数减少、红细胞沉降率（ESR）增快、C反应蛋白增高、白细胞计数正常、乳酸脱氢酶增高、氧合指数降低。
32306836,两组患者的胸部CT检查均以双侧受累为主。
32306853,除呼吸困难症状外，两组患者其余临床特征的差异均无统计学意义。
32306864,<b>结论：</b> 临床诊断NCP核酸阳性与阴性患者的临床特征类似，但呼吸困难症状多出现于核酸阳性组，所以我们应提高对NCP核酸检测的认识，以防漏诊及误诊；另外需进一步寻找更快速准确确诊NCP的手段及方法。.
32307014,On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China.
32307298,The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
32307320,Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses.
32307322,As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with &gt; 100 known deaths.
32309266,As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare.
32309267,Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.
32309388,Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence.
32310621,While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant.
32310816,Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic.
32310916,There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
32310920,What is the animal reservoir?
32310921,Is there an intermediate animal reservoir?
32311047,Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV?
32311303,We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines.
32311350,We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.
32311437,Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/laboratory-diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus.
32311451,The aim of this case series is to illustrate the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT findings of patients with acute respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China.
32311826,We describe the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown.
32311836,A retrospective review of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32312018,All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes.
32312025,Lung lesions were characterized by a high <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement.
32312064,Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism.
32312290,Although <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.
32312568,The aim of this study was to investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its relationship with clinical features.
32312574,Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020.
32312628,The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed.
32312676,Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included.
32312717,With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels.
32313296,The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%).
32313588,Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 ± 6 lung segments involved.
32313785,The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%).
32313822,The average pulmonary inflammation index value was (34% ± 20%) for all the patients.
32313828,Correlation analysis showed that the pulmonary inflammation index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P &lt; 0.05).
32313886,The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple ground glass opacity, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura.
32314050,There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results.
32314058,Computed tomography plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.
32314249,The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still remained severe.
32314685,As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province.
32314699,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
32315171,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot;strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance.
32315725,Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect.
32315907,The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making.
32316233,Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results.
32316618,Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces.
32316712,We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system.
32317153,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot;strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality.
32317257,Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19.
32317409,Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms.
32317557,The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.
32317558,For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported.
32317591,Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center.
32317810,Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended.
32318325,Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies.
32318703,Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>.
32318891,Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation.
32319446,Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19.
32319971,Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis.
32320064,We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
32320375,We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
32320809,It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32323011,Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
32323016,However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32323908,Currently, the epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still ongoing.
32323974,The characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and clinical phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and rountine therapy for other diseases.
32324101,Breast dieases are clinical common diseases.
32324331,In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources.
32324359,Besides, we should select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast diseases without delay.

32327383,The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019, and spread rapidly across the country.
32327448,After the outbreak of this disease, the overwhelming majority of cities have launched the &quot;first level response&quot; and the regular diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients are greatly affected.
32327904,The digestive systemic cancer is the most common malignancy.
32328954,Most patients are diagnosed in the advanced stage with poor prognosis.
32329026,The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia poses new challenges to diagnosis and treatment of the patients with digestive system malignancies.
32329102,Based on the fully understanding of the characteristics of digestive system tumors, we should change the treatment strategy and adopt more reasonable treatment strategy timely during the epidemic period to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia on the treatment.

32329881,To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases.
32329958,However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk.
32330078,First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed.
32330124,Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed.
32330291,Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests.
32330303,In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems.
32330313,Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.
32330340,Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
32330356,This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans.
32330414,Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency.
32330437,Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February.
32330439,Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States.
32330458,Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection.
32331519,As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown.
32331845,The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection.
32332061,Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time.
32332765,In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.
32333222,After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections.
32333248,Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32333544,This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19).
32333644,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security.
32333860,There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses.
32333929,The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

32336317,The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population.
32336564,It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period.
32336594,With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate.
32336959,Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised.
32337113,By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th<sup>,</sup> 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions.
32337143,We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak.
32337148,Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation.
32337201,The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.
32337662,The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.

32340389,Background Chest CT is used for diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as an important complement to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.
32340541,Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19.
32340555,Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included.
32340751,With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed.
32340833,Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more.
32340912,Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans.
32341078,The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results.
32341143,In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases.
32341311,By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative.
32341519,Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19.
32341718,Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.
32341721,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries.
32341722,Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-Cov-2]) nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations.
32341946,In addition, high false-negative rates were reported.
32342051,There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.
32342191,We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages.
32342543,With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses.
32342566,The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites.
32342570,The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%.
32342849,In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples.
32342927,The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood.
32342928,The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.
32343300,It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.
32343968,A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China.
32344166,We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.
32344309,Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled.
32344317,Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (&gt;1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (&gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks).
32344370,Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled.
32344438,The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0).
32344568,The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4.
32345226,The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments).
32345443,In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]).
32345728,Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21).
32346223,Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).
32346392,COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks.
32346593,Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32346790,None.
32346843,An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the United States (1).
32346873,As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1).
32347053,There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States.
32347067,Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.
32347112,This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States.
32347200,These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission.
32347618,Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32347761,U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners.
32347772,Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html.
32347964,As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities.
32348233,The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19.
32348339,With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China.
32348585,We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China.
32348588,All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital).
32349032,This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years).
32349033,All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT).
32349121,We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions.
32349382,In addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution.
32349902,The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough.
32350047,More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved.
32350048,Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%).
32350226,Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings.
32350462,In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days.
32350794,SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests.
32350796,Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32350871,Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.
32351037,Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are grim at present.
32351103,In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and treatment of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing medical advice online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency operation reasonably, etc.
32351814,Budd-Chiari syndrome is a complex disorder, and severity of the disease varies, serious cases can be life threatening.
32351851,While fighting the epidemic, medical workers should also ensure the medical needs of patients.
32352202,However, instead of continuing the traditional treatment, a new management system should be developed.
32352309,Based on the characteristics of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China and our experience, we divide the patients into ordinary and critical cases, and treatment strategies suitable for the epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward for reference and discussion by physicians.

32356508,The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2.
32356641,The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease. https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov.
32356672,Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32356760,To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32356761,A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset.
32357210,The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.
32357257,Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three.
32357288,Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P&lt;0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P&lt;0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients.
32357381,Mild patients had low to moderate fever (&lt;39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein.
32357503,Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging.
32357575,For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36.
32357808,The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum.
32357994,Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15.
32358689,The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.

32363045,Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing.
32363205,We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.
32363337,We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals.
32363809,The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained.
32364028,Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.
32364358,By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service.
32364528,Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively.
32364936,The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male.
32364959,192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history.
32364962,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%).
32365415,The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days.
32365567,As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
32365891,On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing.
32366131,Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate.
32366162,The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

32366759,An ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus has recently emerged in China.
32367319,Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 19 suspect cases.
32367615,We compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid amplification test results from different samples including oropharyngeal swab, blood, urine and stool with 3 different fluorescent RT-PCR kits.
32367683,Nine out of the 19 patients had 2019-nCoV infection detected using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples.
32367749,None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples.
32367888,These three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients.
32368493,Therefore, it is possible that infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only.
32368531,It might be better to make a diagnosis combining the computed tomography scans and nucleic acid detection.
32368550,The 2019 Coronavirus epidemic, provisionally called 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market.
32368570,There is an international push to contain the virus and prevent its spread.
32368728,It is feasible that potentially infectious samples may be received in histopathology laboratories for diagnosis.
32368875,This technical note presents disinfection procedures and histotechnology processes that should alleviate the risk of infection to laboratory staff.
32368928,Using data obtained from similar coronaviruses, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), experts are confident that 70% ethanol and 0.1% sodium hypochlorite should inactivate the virus.

32381642,是否能有效提高危重患者救治生存率？
32381643,针对以上疑问，现从感染科临床医师的角度提出相应的建议和思考。.
32382449,A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19.
32382463,Most cases and sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy.
32382737,Since the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.
32382746,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.
32383179,The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years).
32383182,We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients.
32383254,The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies.
32383370,We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. <b>RESULTS.</b> COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19.
32383638,Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus.
32383778,These patients were isolated and obtained treatment.
32383963,Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19.
32384019,The The &quot;reversed halo&quot; sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features.
32384153,The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection.
32385458,There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients.
32385648,However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.
32385976,To describe the infection control preparedness measures undertaken for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus) in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on December 31, 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong.
32385985,A bundled approach of active and enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs) with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented.
32385990,Epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental samples, and air samples were collected and analyzed.
32386011,From day 1 to day 42, 42 of 1,275 patients (3.3%) fulfilling active (n = 29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n = 13) were confirmed to have the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32386012,The number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 of 13 confirmed cases (7.7%, day 22 to day 32) to 27 of 29 confirmed cases (93.1%, day 33 to day 42; P &lt; .001).
32386014,Among them, 28 patients (66.6%) came from 8 family clusters.
32386015,Of 413 HCWs caring for these confirmed cases, 11 (2.7%) had unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days.
32386016,None of these was infected, and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
32386017,Environmental surveillance was performed in the room of a patient with viral load of 3.3 × 106 copies/mL (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) and 5.9 × 106 copies/mL (saliva), respectively.
32386018,SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples (7.7%) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.
32386019,Appropriate hospital infection control measures was able to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32386027,On 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China.
32386147,Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients.
32386435,Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.
32386514,In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay which is used in &gt;30 European laboratories.
32387057,Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection <i>in vitro</i> (1.8 TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with <i>in vitro</i> RNA transcripts).
32387246,Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays.
32387332,The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRd-P2-negative specimens [119/273 (43.6%) vs 77/273 (28.2%), P&lt;0.001], including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens.
32387389,The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21×10<sup>4</sup> RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21×10<sup>2</sup> to 4.71×10<sup>5</sup> RNA copies/ml).
32387409,The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture.
32387456,The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.
32387786,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the principles of differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients during the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing one case of lymphoma who presented pulmonary ground-glass opacities (GGO) after courses of chemotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records.
32387823,Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected.
32387968,Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. <b>Results:</b> Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative.
32388083,One case was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen.
32388470,His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes.
32388471,This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without fever and other respiratory symptoms.
32388472,Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. <b>Conclusions:</b> The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients.
32388698,The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration.
32389516,The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients.
32389518,Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated if infectious disease is considered. <b>目的：</b> 结合化疗后出现肺内磨玻璃影的淋巴瘤患者的临床特征，分析当前新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情期间肿瘤患者出现肺内浸润的鉴别诊断和临床处理思路。
32389615,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析2020年2月13日至2月28日就诊于中国医学科学院肿瘤医院内科的139例患者的基线人口学特征和临床病理资料，分析患者的临床表现、流行病学史、实验室检查和胸部CT扫描影像学资料，在Pubmed、Embase、CNKI等数据库中检索相关文献中肿瘤患者肺部浸润的影像学资料。
32389784,<b>结果：</b> 在139例行化疗前胸部CT检查的患者中，7例（5.0%）患者提示肺内新发浸润性病灶，其中5例（3.6%）以肺内磨玻璃影为主要表现，3例行新型冠状病毒核酸检测均为阴性。
32390279,其中1例为老年男性，诊断为淋巴瘤，CHOP方案（环磷酰胺+多柔比星+长春新碱+强的松）化疗后，无发热和呼吸道症状，血常规示淋巴细胞减少，胸部CT示双肺多发磨玻璃密度影，否认COVID-19流行病学史，经核酸检测排除COVID-19，诊断为病毒性肺炎，给予经验性抗感染治疗。
32390523,<b>结论：</b> 在COVID-19疫情期间，肿瘤患者新发以磨玻璃影为主的肺内浸润时，应结合流行病学史、临床症状、CT表现、实验室检查结果等综合判断，适当放宽新型冠状病毒核酸检测范围，考虑感染性疾病时应在启动经验性抗感染治疗的前提下，密切观察病情和胸部影像学变化。.
32390696,By 27 February 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively.
32391234,COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally.
32391242,Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).
32391369,Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days.
32391411,The basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS.
32391518,A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19.
32391657,Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem.
32391658,A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.
32391659,Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS.
32391662,We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.
32391664,This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future.
32391666,The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international significance.
32391670,There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management.
32392007,In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease.
32392282,Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades.
32392948,The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern.
32393111,There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock.
32393381,Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19.
32393438,Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age &gt;60 years (MuLBSTA score).
32393447,Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples.
32394687,Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation.
32394993,Role of steroids is still inconclusive.
32395494,Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed.
32395542,Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important.
32395550,Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended.
32395673,To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.
32395793,In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood Market.
32395829,Subsequent investigations revealed a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak.
32395897,The rising case numbers have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the wholesale isolation of Wuhan.
32395964,Alongside this has been a robust scientific response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and rapid development of highly specific diagnostics.
32395966,This article will review the new knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its clinical features.
32396075,2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has attracted the world's attention over the last month.
32396101,The Chinese government has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19).
32396455,However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility and still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such as whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to their infants.
32396505,Our research presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in China to better understand the transmission and diagnosis regarding this infectious disease.
32396550,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012.
32396769,Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur.
32396903,Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths).
32396947,Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015.
32397000,MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures.
32397262,This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
32397399,We report diagnosis and management of the first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized in Toronto, Canada.
32397487,No healthcare-associated transmission occurred.
32397688,In the face of a potential pandemic of COVID-19, we suggest sustainable and scalable control measures developed based on lessons learned from SARS.
32397844,Novel coronavirus pneumonia was novel coronavirus infection that has dominated pulmonary infection since December 2019.
32397847,The main manifestations were fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, normal or leukopenia in peripheral blood and changes in chest CT and in severe cases, multiple organ failure might occur.
32397951,The National Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the disease.
32398268,Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic area, or had clustering diseases.
32398273,However, novel coronavirus pneumonia was becoming more and more blurred after vanishing epidemic.
32398322,The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia was facing challenges not only because of large number of tourists increasing dramatically after the relieving of epidemic, but also patients with other diseases return from different areas to search for medical care.
32398567,In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases.
32398918,We were trying to find the similarities and differences among them, and to identify clues to the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia, so as to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.
32398954,2019年12月以来我国陆续出现新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染引起的以肺部病变为主的新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称新冠肺炎），主要临床表现为发热、干咳、气促、外周血白细胞不高或降低以及胸部CT改变等，严重者出现多脏器功能衰竭。
32399453,随着对本病的认识不断加深，近期内已连续6次修订诊疗方案。
32399479,新冠肺炎患者通常在发病前14天内有武汉或其他新冠肺炎传播地区的旅行史或居住史，或曾接触过来自疫区的发热或有呼吸道症状的患者，或为集聚发病。
32399481,但随着疫情逐渐得到控制，临床以呼吸道症状前来就诊的患者的流行病学史已越来越模糊，各级综合医院陆续面对新冠肺炎诊断和鉴别诊断的挑战。
32399515,现将新冠肺炎患者的临床表现及肺部影像学特征，与北京协和医院历年收治影像学表现为弥漫性肺病的其他肺部感染及非感染性疾病进行比较，尝试找出其相似及不同之处，为新冠肺炎鉴别提供线索，保证精准诊疗。.
32399755,<i>Background:</i> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.
32399942,Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.
32399995,The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32400049,The data will be used for future reference. <i>Methods:</i> From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.
32400924,The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19.
32401064,Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <i>Results:</i> This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.
32401550,In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.
32401630,Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).
32401931,Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).
32402056,Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.
32402061,Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.
32403007,The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays arose when Germany was confronted with the first travel-associated outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe.
32403008,We describe our laboratory experiences during a large contact tracing investigation, comparing previously published real-time RT-PCR assays in different PCR systems and a commercial kit.
32403153,We found that assay performance using the same primers and probes with different PCR systems varied and the commercial kit performed well.
32403176,There's an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020.
32403190,Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events.
32403194,The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract.
32403995,Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages.
32404302,The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens.
32404473,Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates.
32404481,However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics.
32404482,Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.
32404780,Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32404786,<b>Objective:</b> To construct and evaluate a diagnosis process for 2019-Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> A continuous cohort of adults and adolescent (≥12 years) who screened COVID-19 was included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020 in which cases were divided the test library and the verification library.
32404797,Their gender, age, onset time were recorded.
32404799,Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement.
32404896,According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32405071,The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. <b>Results:</b> A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library.
32405079,In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years).
32405080,There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid.
32405081,Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively.
32405101,The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, <i>P</i>=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively).
32405232,The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32405236,The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31).
32405252,In validation library, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya process was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9% (10/13). <b>Conclusions:</b> The Xiangya process can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19 well, and can be applied as a reliable basis for confirmed cases detection in adults and adolescent (≥12 years) in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19.
32405254,The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation. <b>目的：</b> 构建新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的诊断流程（简称湘雅流程），评估其准确度。
32405259,<b>方法：</b> 纳入2020年1月23日至2月3日在中南大学湘雅医院排查COVID-19的≥12岁人群连续队列，按时间顺序分为试验库和验证库；记录该队列患者的性别、年龄、病程、流行病学史及发热，检测血常规及流感抗体。
32405270,所有患者均行胸部CT，评价罹患COVID-19的可能性（第1类和第2类被认为CT-COVID-19阳性，可能为COVID-19），评估肺受累范围。
32405452,按国家卫健委推荐诊疗方案（简称卫健委方案），采集疑似病例咽拭子标本，实时荧光定量聚合酶链式反应（RT-PCR）法检测新型冠状病毒核酸，在试验库中计算流行病学史、发热、血淋巴细胞降低及CT检出核酸阳性的效能，多指标构建COVID-19诊断的湘雅流程，检验湘雅流程及卫健委方案检出核酸阳性的效能，最后在验证库内验证湘雅流程的效能。
32405509,<b>结果：</b> 共纳入382例排查者，其中试验库261例、验证库121例；男192例（50.3%）、女190例（49.7%），中位年龄35岁（范围：15～92岁），有流行病学史183例（47.9%）、发热275例（72.0%）、血淋巴细胞降低212例（55.5%），胸部CT异常114例（29.8%），CT-COVID-19阳性43例（11.3%），咽拭子核酸阳性30例（7.9%）。
32405603,胸部CT检出核酸阳性的灵敏度及特异度分别为0.950与0.704，准确度（0.809）均高于流行病学史（0.660）、发热（0.532）及血淋巴细胞降低（0.596）（<i>P</i>=0.001、0.002、0.003）。
32405641,湘雅流程与卫健委方案均具有较高的灵敏度（均为1.000），但特异度、准确度均高于后者（0.872比0.765、0.778比0.592，均<i>P</i>&lt;0.001）。
32405882,湘雅流程需检测核酸的人数少于卫健委方案（31比64例），相差率为51.6%，核酸检测阳性率为64.5%（20/31）。
32406374,在验证库中，湘雅流程筛选疑似病例的准确度为0.967，核酸检测阳性率为76.9%（10/13）。
32406381,<b>结论：</b> 湘雅流程能预判新型冠状病毒核酸的检测结果，在流行期内可作为湖北省外地区≥12岁人群筛选COVID-19疑似病例的参考，但还需扩大样本进一步验证。.
32406522,Since December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has impacted nearly &gt;90,000 people in more than 75 countries.
32406638,In this case report, we aim to define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment.
32406829,A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia.”
32407306,Initially, she was given Tamiflu.
32407937,The influenza A virus serology was negative.
32408156,Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient’s symptoms did not improve.
32408222,The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative.
32408547,It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip.
32409114,Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation.
32409210,Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive.
32409313,Chest computed tomography offers fast and convenient evaluation of patients with suspected 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32409431,The etiologic agent of an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in January 2020.
32409438,A patient in the United States was given a diagnosis of infection with this virus by the state of Washington and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 20, 2020.
32410206,We isolated virus from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from this patient and characterized the viral sequence, replication properties, and cell culture tropism.
32410236,We found that the virus replicates to high titer in Vero-CCL81 cells and Vero E6 cells in the absence of trypsin.
32410816,We also deposited the virus into 2 virus repositories, making it broadly available to the public health and research communities.
32411552,We hope that open access to this reagent will expedite development of medical countermeasures.
32411619,In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China.
32412033,Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.
32412509,The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.
32412551,Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.
32412556,The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.
32412790,The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.
32413502,Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
32413984,Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.
32414384,The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.
32414594,Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.
32414626,The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases.
32414838,Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases.
32415341,The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes.
32415585,Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32415767,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become an important public health issue in the world.
32415815,More than 118 000 cases were confirmed around the world.
32416069,The main clinical manifestations were respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms.
32416259,However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32416289,In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.
32416318,There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32416433,The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019.
32416598,There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020).
32416599,The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d.
32416600,The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
32416785,The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction.
32416961,Many people are asymptomatic.
32417248,The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%.
32417674,Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests.
32417870,Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).
32418377,The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease.
32418559,Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established.
32418773,Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions.
32418804,The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality.
32419639,The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.
32419694,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging in China, especially in Hubei Province, which has resulted great dangers in people's life and national economy.
32419750,According to the guidelines drafted by China's Center for Disease prevention and Control (CDC), the positive nucleic acid test is need to the diagnosis of patient with COVID-19.
32419766,Upper respiratory tract specimens are the main sources for nucleic acid detection.
32419767,However, based on international guidelines of COVID-19 , no recommended level of upper respiratory tract sampling method is proposed.
32420073,Therefore, which kind of sampling methods should be chosen to help the COVID-19 diagnosis and which way is the most secure for doctors and nurses is our concern.
32420523,In this review, we analyzed a total of 10 literatures on the sampling methods of upper respiratory tract related to infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and influenza A (H1N1), which were spread worldwide in past years.
32420788,Literatures were collected from the three dimensions of sampling method, sampling time, and sampling safety.
32420927,It was found that among all the upper respiratory sampling methods, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) had a higher positive rate within 2 weeks of symptom onset, while combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs (NS + OPS) was the least harmful to medical staff during sampling.
32420937,We wish this review is helpful for the prevention of COVID-19.
32420939,新型冠状病毒肺炎正在中国肆虐，特别是在湖北武汉，对人民生命健康和经济造成了极大的损失。
32421497,根据中国疾病预防控制中心（Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention，CDC）指南，新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的确诊及治愈均需核酸检测结果确认。
32421539,上呼吸道取样方法是核酸检测的主要样本来源，但在各国CDC发布的指南中只提出了上呼吸道取样方法，并未提出推荐级别。
32421627,因此，患者就诊时该选择怎样的取样方法、何种取样方法医护人员的安全性最高成为我们关注的问题。
32421686,本文对近年来世界范围内流行的严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）、中东呼吸综合征（MERS）、甲型H1N1流感等传染性疾病相关上呼吸道取样方法研究共10篇文献进行了综述。
32422376,从取样方法、取样时间、医护人员安全性3个维度整理了收集的文献，发现在所有上呼吸道取样方法中，鼻咽抽取物（NPA）在发病2周内具有较高的阳性率，鼻腔+口咽联合拭子（NS+OPS）对取样操作的医务人员危害最小。
32422384,期望本综述能对此次疫情的防控提供一些参考。.
32422408,Starting around December 2019, an epidemic of pneumonia, which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, broke out in Wuhan, China, and is spreading throughout the world.
32422569,A new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was soon found to be the cause.
32422662,At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation.
32422983,In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
32423024,The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them, 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level and 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level.
32423250,Although overall variation in open-reading frame (ORF) regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95), respectively.
32423291,These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes.
32423298,Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.
32423299,In December 2019, an outbreak of novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32423324,By February 14, 2020, it has led to 66 492 confirmed patients in China and high mortality up to ∼2.96% (1123/37 914) in Wuhan.
32423435,Here we report the first family case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confirmed in Wuhan and treated using the combination of western medicine and Chinese traditional patent medicine Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL).
32423842,This report describes the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of three cases from a family, suggests the expected therapeutic effects of SHL on COVID-19, and warrants further clinical trials.
32423899,In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China.
32424616,A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus.
32425000,This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, respectively.
32425010,The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and all over the world now.
32425014,The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.
32425183,Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China.
32425237,Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing.
32425251,SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans.
32425268,The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease.
32425279,In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1.
32425294,Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials.
32425338,Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.
32425356,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China.
32425470,We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only.
32425646,In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020.
32425648,Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5-21 days.
32425651,The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7).
32425655,We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis.
32425657,Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups.
32425714,The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p &lt; 0·05).
32426111,After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p &lt; 0·05).
32426285,The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p &lt; 0·05).
32426754,In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.
32426755,Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China.
32427000,The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well.
32427166,However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult.
32427216,Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases.
32427226,Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases.
32427468,The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon.
32427517,The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing.
32427569,Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models.
32427924,The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.
32428207,There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020.
32428243,Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency.
32428957,At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities.
32429101,This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation.
32429249,This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.
32430429,A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world.
32431287,This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32432217,As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite.
32432804,Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
32432996,Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues.
32433015,Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.
32433168,Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32433217,The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory lung infiltration.
32433248,China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia as a statutory infectious disease.
32434058,To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
32434310,Recently, some global cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia have been caused by second- or third-generation transmission of the viral infection, resulting in no traceable epidemiological history.
32434339,Owing to the complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, the first symptom and imaging features of patients can be very atypical and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections remains a challenge.
32434633,It would aid radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the early atypical symptom and imaging features of the disease and contribute to the prevention of infected patients being missed.
32434634,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in January 2020, and proposed management strategies for patients with gynecological tumors under risk of COVID19. <b>Results:</b> Three patients were treated COVID19 based on the national diagnosis and treatment protocol as well as research progress.
32434635,Meanwhile, these patients were appropriately adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for gynecological tumors.
32434706,Pneumonia was cured in 2 patients, and one patient died of COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with gynecological malignant tumors are high-risk groups prone to COVID-19 infection, and gynecological oncologists need to carry out education, prevention, control and treatment according to specific conditions.
32434790,While actively preventing and controlling COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological malignant tumors should be carried out in an orderly and safe manner. <b>目的：</b> 在新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID-19)暴发和传播期间，探讨妇科恶性肿瘤患者的管理策略。
32434888,<b>方法：</b> 对2020年1月武汉大学人民医院3例妇科恶性肿瘤伴发新型冠状病毒肺炎患者临床特点、处理方案和疾病转归进行回顾性分析，提出新型冠状病毒肺炎流行期间妇科恶性肿瘤患者的管理策略。
32434891,<b>结果：</b> 3例患者在按照国家颁布的COVID-19诊治方案及研究进展给予针对性治疗的前提下，依照妇科肿瘤临床指南适当调整了治疗方案，对肿瘤进行了个性化的治疗。
32435872,2例患者新型冠状病毒肺炎治愈，1例患者死于新型冠状病毒肺炎。
32435925,<b>结论：</b> 妇科恶性肿瘤患者是感染COVID-19的高危人群，妇科肿瘤医师需根据具体情况做好宣教、防控及治疗等工作。
32436355,在积极防控新型冠状病毒肺炎的同时，有序安全地开展妇科恶性肿瘤患者的诊治。.
32436441,Unexplained pneumonia (UP) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and has infected more than 9000 cases by 31 January 2020.
32436845,Shanghai reported the first imported case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) in 20 January 2020.
32437004,A combinative approach of real-time RT-PCR, CRISPR-based assay and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were used to diagnose this unexplained pneumonia patient.
32437124,Real-time RT-PCR and CRISPR-based assay both reported positive.
32437576,This sample belonged to Betacoronavirus and shared a more than 99% nucleotide (nt) identity with the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates.
32437667,We further compared pros and cons of common molecular diagnostics in UP.
32437768,In this study, we illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostics to rule out common pathogens and performed mNGS to obtain unbiased potential pathogen result for the diagnosis of UP.
32437932,A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and 4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020).
32437936,The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020.
32437942,Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32438256,Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data.
32438340,The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters.
32438345,Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021.
32438579,Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions.
32438677,While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained.
32438868,Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.
32438876,The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.
32438898,To identify the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of pediatric patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
32438945,Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included.
32439651,The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis.
32440387,Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates.
32440661,There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases.
32440666,The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2-13 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys.
32440883,More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases.
32441380,The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0-42 days).
32441935,There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease.
32442030,The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time.
32442035,More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province.
32442265,Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference.
32442581,Although clinical manifestations of children's COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection.
32442684,The distribution of children's COVID-19 cases varied with time and space, and most of the cases were concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas.
32442699,Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence of human-to-human transmission.
32442720,Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations.
32442842,Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants.
32443202,We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness.
32443442,This case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes.
32443459,When managing such patients, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is essential.
32443828,Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe.
32443834,People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19.
32443856,However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited.
32444412,To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters.
32444415,Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family members were described.
32444460,The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.
32444797,Both of them had normal chest CT images.
32444866,After general and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly.
32445083,Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province.
32445165,Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history.
32445195,Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults.
32445204,We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.
32445839,With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32446037,Consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China.
32446305,China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province.
32446538,However, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear.
32446902,We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures.
32447292,We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria.
32447328,Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5-4.3), after imposing lockdown.
32447443,A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively.
32447742,Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r = 0.91, p = NS).
32447746,A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures.
32448085,A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.
32448136,Recent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei.
32448333,To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China.
32448757,Retrospective case series. 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.
32449178,Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020.
32449614,Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
32449791,The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%.
32450107,In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission.
32450712,In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple.
32450761,The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%).
32451162,The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days.
32451362,According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.
32451366,Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.
32451655,The role of clinical laboratory data in the differential diagnosis of the severe forms of COVID-19 has not been definitely established.
32451808,The aim of this study was to look for the warning index in severe COVID-19 patients.
32452050,We investigated 43 adult patients with COVID-19.
32452195,The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients).
32452539,A comparison of the hematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6), d-dimer (d-D), glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (P &lt; .05).
32452700,The optimal threshold and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of IL-6 were 24.3 and 0.795 µg/L, respectively, while those of d-D were 0.28 and 0.750 µg/L, respectively.
32452739,The area under the ROC curve of IL-6 combined with d-D was 0.840.
32452804,The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and d-D tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and d-D by parallel test in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%.
32453196,IL-6 and d-D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.
32453695,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019.
32454253,As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths.
32454398,The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32454807,A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley.
32454888,In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
32455058,The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
32455471,All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.
32455796,Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%).
32456944,The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars.
32457036,Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control.
32457048,Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed.
32458044,Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea.
32458125,Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission.
32458174,To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.
32458197,There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
32458356,During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.
32458479,Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.
32458502,Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious diseases.
32458546,Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases imported into China every year.
32458596,If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
32458597,Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.
32458599,This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019年底以来, 一种新型冠状病毒病肺炎 (COVID-19) 在我国大范围流行, 不仅严重威胁人民群众的生命安全和身体健康, 同时也给其他传染病防控带来了严峻挑战。
32459046,目前, 我国每年仍有近3 000例境外输入性疟疾病例, 如不能及时开展病例诊治和疫点调查处置, 不仅有可能危及患者生命, 还可能引起继发传播而威胁我国消除疟疾成果。
32459192,新型冠状病毒肺炎流行范围广、传播能力强, 不仅疟疾患者在就医过程中有可能被感染, 而且医务人员在开展临床诊治、样本检测和流行病学调查时也面临感染风险。
32459574,本文分析新型冠状病毒肺炎流行对我国消除疟疾工作的挑战, 并探讨相应的应对策略和措施, 从而为医务工作者提供参考。.
32459647,Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32459655,The pathogen in these cases is a new type of coronavirus.
32459790,The World Health Organization confirmed this diagnosis and named the pathogen SARSCoV-2.
32459857,The disease caused by SARSCoV-2 is called Corona Virus Disease (COVID-2019).
32460086,The virus is highly infectious and pathogenic, causing human-to-human transmission.
32460173,At present, SARSCoV-2 is still rampant in the world.
32460185,Zhengzhou City in Henan Province serves as an example, 102 people have been confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV-2 (at 24:00 on February 5th, 2020), including three children, the youngest is 4 years old.
32460364,From the perspective of clinical pediatricians as the first line fighting the epidemic, this paper will discuss the clinical characteristics, prevention and control measures, outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric cases.
32460457,The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached Germany.
32460829,The majority of people infected present with mild disease, but there are severe cases that need intensive care.
32461066,Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung function.
32461068,Diagnosis relies on PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract.
32461285,Severe ARDS reflects the hallmark of a critical course of the disease.
32461326,Preventing nosocomial infections (primarily by correct use of personal protective equipment) and maintenance of hospitals' operational capability are of utmost importance.
32461502,Departments of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and emergency medicine will envisage major challenges.
32461973,Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of infection.
32462267,The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the previous studies.
32462289,Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas.
32462316,They progressed within 3 days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs.
32462398,Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest CT.
32462445,These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32462501,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency.
32462666,Here we highlight nine most important research questions concerning virus transmission, asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, origin of virus and viral pathogenesis.
32462675,Background CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32462724,Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32462744,Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study.
32462756,A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved.
32462770,Those features were analyzed for temporal change.
32462968,Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels.
32463434,The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods).
32463475,The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter.
32464579,Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]).
32464670,The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter.
32464685,The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31/42 [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype.
32466199,Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11.
32466536,The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness.
32466577,Background Coronavirus disease has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020.
32466623,It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT.
32466738,Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances.
32466862,Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19.
32468193,Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the robustness of the model.
32468229,The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020.
32468845,Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.
32469614,Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients.
32469732,The average age is 49±15 years and there were slightly more male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29).
32470120,The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127 (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively, with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value&lt;0.001).
32470212,The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175) and 92% (239 of 259), respectively, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97).
32470577,Conclusions A deep learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate it from community acquired pneumonia and other lung diseases.
32470885,Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19 and sustained by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the latest biological hazard to assume the relevance of insidious worldwide threat.
32471001,One obvious question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks.
32471703,Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32471794,These include etiological diagnosis, patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance.
32471894,Nonetheless, some structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of whom are with severe disease.
32471903,Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.
32471930,Switzerland is among the countries with the highest number of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases per capita in the world.
32472024,There are likely many people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease compatible with COVID-19.
32472403,Testing on its own will not stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32472459,Testing is part of a strategy.
32472990,The World Health Organization recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts.
32472991,In this article, we explain why the testing strategy in Switzerland should be strengthened urgently, as a core component of a combination approach to control COVID-19.
32473009,Over the past three months, the world has faced an unprecedented health hazard.
32473085,The World Health Organization has announced a pandemic infection with an unknown species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
32473124,Spreading mainly through the droplet route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and chills.
32473179,A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults, those with immune disorders and co-morbidities.
32473352,Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock.
32473390,The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection.
NA,It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of providing anesthesiology and intensive care services.
NA,Due to the fact that effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting the virus.
NA,Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China.
NA,It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients.
NA,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
NA,More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments.
NA,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
NA,The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
NA,(2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors.
NA,Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.).
NA,If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended.
NA,(3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated.
NA,All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.
NA,(4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level.
NA,After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.
NA,We hope our &quot;Renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues.
NA,新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）目前正在我国肆虐。
NA,已经证实，新冠肺炎存在明显的院内感染现象，给外科医护人员和住院患者造成严重威胁。
NA,虽然结直肠外科并不是此次抗击疫情的一线学科，但在特殊的形式下，如何最大限度地在保护患者、家属、医务工作者自身的健康以及病区和医院医疗安全的前提下，为患者提供最优质的医疗服务，保证以往临床工作的有序开展，是当下的艰巨任务。
NA,笔者参照我国《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案》，结合《上海仁济医院新型冠状病毒文件汇总》的实际工作情况，总结了新冠肺炎疫情防控形势下，如何开展结直肠外科临床工作，分享了如何在疫情防控情况下，针对结直肠肿瘤急诊患者的诊疗流程、对结直肠肿瘤的诊断和准备择期入院手术结直肠癌患者的处理、病房的防护、围手术期的管理等，更重要的是详细介绍了疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术及围手术期的管理，包括医务人员及手术室、手术器械的防控措施。
NA,其中特别强调的包括：（1）多学科诊疗模式(MDT)应贯穿于结直肠肿瘤整个诊疗过程，MDT成员中，除常规相科室外，呼吸科和感染科也需列入。（
NA,2）肠镜检查有可能导致患者交叉感染，对操作人员和护理人员也存在较大风险，故仅优先对于可能危及生命的急诊患者（出血、梗阻、消化道异物等）进行；若疑似新冠肺炎患者，不采取内镜下减压措施，直接拟定急诊手术治疗方案。（
NA,3）疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者应放置于隔离病室，配备单独医疗器具，在指定的独立负压（-5 Pa以下）手术间完成手术；围手术期伤口换药等使用过所有一次性物品、体液、粪便等，均按医疗废物规范进行处置。（
NA,4）参加疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术的医护人员应实施三级防护，术后应隔离进行&quot;医学观察&quot;14 d。
NA,希望能对同道有所助益。.
NA,The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.
NA,Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients.
NA,For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice.
NA,The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy.
NA,Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time.
NA,Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards.
NA,Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging examination.
NA,Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the specifics of each patient during epidemic situation.
NA,新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的爆发给结直肠癌的治疗带来了困难。
NA,肿瘤患者作为感染的高危人群，肿瘤病史作为新冠肺炎不良预后的重要因素，都是当下医患双方共同面临的挑战。
NA,对于复发转移性结直肠癌患者，低强度的维持治疗是更好的选择，病情变化或恶性度较高的肿瘤患者仍需接受联合化疗。
NA,对于根治术后的患者，鉴于辅助化疗获益程度的相对有限，可降低治疗强度并减少治疗时间。
NA,面对发热的肿瘤化疗患者，需要对患者的发热原因进行分析，按国家《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第六版）》文件规定的流程接受排查。
NA,病情稳定、一般状况良好及治疗有效的患者可择期推迟影像学评估的时间。
NA,临床医师应根据每例患者的具体情况作出个体化的临床决策。.
NA,To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients with various disease severity.
NA,The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020.
NA,We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia.
NA,Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or manifested mild changes of lung infection.
NA,All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening.
NA,In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively.
NA,An extensive &quot;white lung&quot;, with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients (3, 4%).
NA,On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities.
NA,Different CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratification.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, has rapidly swept around the world just within a month, causing global public health emergency.
NA,In diagnosis, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations can supplement parts of limitations of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.
NA,Based on a comprehensive literature review and the experience in the frontline, we aim to review the typical and relatively atypical CT manifestations with representative COVID-19 cases at our hospital, and hope to strengthen the recognition of these features with radiologists and help them make a quick and accurate diagnosis.Key Points • Ground glass opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern, and crazy paving pattern are typical CT manifestations of COVID-19.
NA,• Emerging atypical CT manifestations, including airway changes, pleural changes, fibrosis, nodules, etc., were demonstrated in COVID-19 patients.
NA,• CT manifestations may associate with the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.
NA,Healthcare systems worldwide are responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care management.
NA,Healthcare providers, and particularly anesthesiologists, are at the frontline of this epidemic, and they need to be aware of the best available evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 and to keep themselves safe while doing so.
NA,Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure.
NA,The authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health organizations.
NA,This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.
NA,Identifying antibodies (Abs) that neutralize infectious agents is the first step for developing therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools for these infectious agents.
NA,However, current approaches for identifying neutralizing Abs (nAbs) typically rely on dilution-based assays that are costly, inefficient, and only survey a small subset of the entire repertoire.
NA,There are also intrinsic biases in many steps of conventional nAb identification processes.
NA,More importantly, conventional assays rely on simple Ab-antigen binding assays, which may not result in identifying the most potent nAbs, as the strongest binder may not be the most potent nAb.
NA,Droplet microfluidic systems have the capability to overcome such limitations by conducting complex multi-step assays with high reliability, resolution, and throughput in a pico-liter volume water-in-oil emulsion droplet format.
NA,Here, we describe the development of PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated microfluidics ENabled Technology), a droplet microfluidic system that can enable high-throughput single-cell resolution identification of nAb repertoires elicited in response to viral infection.
NA,We demonstrate PRESCIENT's ability to identify Abs that neutralize a model viral agent, Murine coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus), which causes high mortality rates in experimentally infected mice.
NA,In-droplet infection of host cells by the virus was first demonstrated, followed by demonstration of in-droplet neutralization by nAbs produced from a single Ab-producing hybridoma cell.
NA,Finally, fluorescence intensity analyses of two populations of hybridoma cell lines (nAb-producing and non-nAb-producing hybridoma cell lines) successfully discriminated between the two populations.
NA,The presented strategy and platform have the potential to identify and investigate neutralizing activities against a broad range of potential infectious agents for which nAbs have yet to be discovered, significantly advancing the nAb identification process as well as reinvigorating the field of Ab discovery, characterization, and development.
NA,The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections at the beginning of the twenty-first century have highlighted the necessity for readily available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods.
NA,The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones.
NA,Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards.
NA,This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan.
NA,Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum.
NA,Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing.
NA,Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy.
NA,Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases.
NA,Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic.
NA,We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases.
NA,Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed.
NA,The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations.
NA,Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia.
NA,Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis.
NA,Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses.
NA,Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe.
NA,All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries across the world including the UK with an increasing death toll.
NA,This will inevitably lead to an increase in the number of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths at autopsy.
NA,The Royal College of Pathologists has responded to this concern with the release of a briefing on autopsy practice relating to COVID-19.
NA,The following article is a summary and interpretation of these guidelines.
NA,It includes a description of hazard group 3 organisms, the category to which SARS-CoV-2 has been assigned, a brief description of what is currently known about the pathological and autopsy findings in COVID-19, a summary of the recommendations for conducting autopsies in suspected COVID-19 cases and the techniques for making the diagnosis at autopsy.
NA,It concludes by considering the clinicopathological correlation and notification of such cases.
NA,Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major healthcare threat.
NA,Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity.
NA,False negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission.
NA,We here aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19.
NA,The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 including IgA, IgM and IgG response were examined by using an ELISA based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein.
NA,Total 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but had typical manifestation).
NA,The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort.
NA,The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection were 5 days (IQR 3-6), while IgG was detected on 14 days (IQR 10-18) after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7% and 77.9% respectively.
NA,In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively.
NA,The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR method after 5.5 days of symptom onset.
NA,The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combined IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compare with a single qPCR test (51.9%).
NA,Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid to the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.
NA,In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, and spread rapidly to China and over 100 countries around the world.
NA,The lung injury and repair caused by COVID-19 has many similarities with the onset and progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) .
NA,Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and some types of new-onset ILD or other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD.
NA,Clinicians need to comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics, clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis.
NA,Because of this, the article will discuss the issues related to the differential diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and ILD, and try to provide reasonable suggestions.
NA,2019年12月，新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）在湖北武汉暴发，并迅速蔓延至全国各地及全球逾100个国家。
NA,因COVID-19所致肺损伤和修复过程与间质性肺疾病（ILD）发病、进展有诸多相似之处，COVID-19与部分新发ILD、其他原因导致的ILD加重鉴别困难。
NA,临床医生需要综合分析流行病史、发病特点、临床表现、影像特征、血清学和病原学检测结果做出准确判断。
NA,鉴于此，本文将针对大家关注的有关COVID-19与ILD的诊断鉴别相关问题进行探讨，并且对ILD合并COVID-19患者的综合管理提出相应参考建议。.
NA,Since 2003, coronavirus has caused multiple major public health events that resulted in global epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome （SARS）, Middle East respiratory syndrome （MERS） and corona virus disease 2019 （COVID-19）.
NA,Especially since COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, Hubei, in December 2019, coronavirus has had a significant impact on people's health and lives.
NA,But so far, the pathological diagnosis of COVID-19 has been relatively deficient： it is still confined to the pathological findings of punctured organs, and the majority of medical workers have poor awareness of its pathological characteristics.
NA,The COVID-19, as same as SARS and MERS, is caused by coronaviruses and can cause viral pneumonia.
NA,They have certain similarities.
NA,This article comprehensively reviews the pathological features observed in the autopsies of the aforementioned three diseases, in order to provide reference to the analysis of pathological changes of COVID-19.
NA,冠状病毒肺炎的病理学特征回顾与展望.
NA,自2003年以来，冠状病毒已造成以严重急性呼吸综合征（severe acute respiratory syndrome，SARS）、中东呼吸综合征（Middle East respiratory syndrome，MERS）和新型冠状病毒肺炎（corona virus disease 2019，COVID-19）为代表的多次全球流行的重大公共卫生事件。
NA,特别是2019年12月至今，湖北武汉爆发的COVID-19，已对人民健康、生命产生了巨大影响。
NA,但截至目前，COVID-19的病理学诊断较为缺乏，尚局限于穿刺器官病理所见，广大医疗工作者对其病理特点认识不足。
NA,COVID-19与SARS、MERS一样，致病源均属冠状病毒科，均引起病毒性肺炎，具有一定的共性。
NA,本文对上述3种疾病尸体检验所见的病理学特征进行较为全面的综述，以期为COVID-19的病理学改变分析提供借鉴和参考。.

NA,The pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is a highly contagious disease.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency.
NA,Currently, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage.
NA,Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.
NA,This review in the hope of helping the public effectively recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a reference for future studies.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people.
NA,Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.
NA,A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020.
NA,The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters.
NA,The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare.
NA,Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia.
NA,Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare.
NA,Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce.
NA,Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults.
NA,Deaths were extremely rare.
NA,Health care workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be psychologically stressed.
NA,To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China.
NA,This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China.
NA,Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible.
NA,The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively.
NA,Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes.
NA,A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%.
NA,A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women.
NA,Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers.
NA,A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]).
NA,Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P &lt; .001).
NA,Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008).
NA,Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P &lt; .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P &lt; .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P &lt; .001).
NA,In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.
NA,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and the disease this agent may induce, are a cause of notable concern for the general population and, of course, among our professionals and patients.
NA,Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a high-risk diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the case of upper GI examinations, and a moderate to low-risk intervention when involving lower GI explorations.
NA,The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of patients infected with the virus, and occasionally in colonic biopsy samples, has been consistently documented.
NA,In fact, viral elimination in the feces may be more prolonged than viral identification in respiratory tract secretions.
NA,Furthermore, viral transmission may occur in asymptomatic individuals.
NA,However, as of this moment no information has been reported on the possibility of viral transmission, even to professionals, via this route.
NA,With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and growing knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment, it has been clear that children are also susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,The children with hematological tumors are a special population with immunosuppression and special therapeutic characteristics.
NA,Here the management guideline for pediatric wards of hematology and oncology during COVID-19 epidemic is established based on the features of children with hematological tumors.
NA,To study the clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infants and young children.
NA,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020.
NA,All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children.
NA,Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea.
NA,There were only symptoms of the respiratory system.
NA,Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count.
NA,Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count.
NA,CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles.
NA,As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign.
NA,Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection.
NA,Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children.
NA,This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of twin girls who were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province, China.
NA,The twin girls, aged 1 year and 2 months, were admitted on January 29, 2020 due to fever for one day and cough and sneezing for two days respectively.
NA,Both recovered after symptomatic treatment.
NA,The two girls had mild symptoms and rapid recovery, suggesting that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be mild and have a good prognosis.
NA,There were differences in the clinical symptoms and imaging findings between the twin girls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection has diverse clinical features in children.
NA,We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.
NA,Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan's 2003 SARS outbreak.
NA,TCB's success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals.
NA,Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease.
NA,These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days.
NA,Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations.
NA,In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector - the quarantine ward.
NA,This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis.
NA,A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB.
NA,Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals.
NA,These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community.
NA,Evidencing eTCB effectiveness is Taiwan's success to date in containing and controlling the community-hospital-community transmission cycle.
NA,Rapid virological diagnosis is needed to limit the length of isolation for suspected COVID-19 cases.
NA,We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France.
NA,Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples.
NA,Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected.
NA,Results were obtained within approximately 3 h of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory.
NA,Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63.
NA,Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission.
NA,Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation.
NA,Confronting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has allowed us to appreciate how efficiently highly-resourced settings can respond to crises.
NA,However even such settings are not prepared to deal with the situation, and lessons are only slowly being learnt.
NA,There is still an urgent need to accelerate protocols that lead to the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing and effective antiviral therapies.
NA,In some high-risk populations, such as dialysis patients, where several individuals are treated at the same time in a limited space and overcrowded areas, our objective must be to ensure protection to patients, the healthcare team and the dialysis ward.
NA,The difficult Italian experience may help other countries to face the challenges.
NA,The experience of the Lombardy underlines the need for gathering and sharing our data to increase our knowledge and support common, initially experience-based, and as soon as possible evidence-based position to face this overwhelming crisis.
NA,&quot;Action at a distance&quot; may be the new norm for clinical researchers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that may require social distancing for the next 18 months.
NA,We must minimize face-to-face contact with vulnerable populations.
NA,But we must also persist, adapt, and help our older patients and study participants during the pandemic.
NA,Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can.
NA,Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.
NA,Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools such as e-mailed surveys or telehealth assessments.
NA,Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping?
NA,What health or social behaviors have changed?
NA,How are they keeping up with current events?
NA,What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities?
NA,Are their healthcare needs being met?
NA,Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends.
NA,Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely and reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants.
NA,Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers.
NA,We have an opportunity to make an impact on our older adult patients now as this pandemic continues to unfold.
NA,Above all, clinical researchers need to continue working, to help as many people as possible through the crisis.
NA,To analyze the CT findings of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were included and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical staging based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial version 6)</i>.
NA,The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types.
NA,Among 67 patients, 3 (4.5%) were mild cases, 35 (52.2%) were ordinary cases, 22 (32.8%) were severe cases, and 7 (10.4%) were critically ill.
NA,There were no abnormal CT findings in mild cases.
NA,In 35 ordinary cases, there were single lesions in 3 cases (8.6%) and multiple lesions in 33 cases (91.4%), while in severe case 1 case had single lesion (4.5%) and 21 had multiple lesions (95.5%).
NA,CT images of ordinary patients were mainly manifested as solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
NA,Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.
NA,CT images in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
NA,The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached Germany.
NA,The majority of people infected present with mild disease, but there are severe cases that need intensive care.
NA,Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung function.
NA,Diagnosis relies on PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract.
NA,Severe ARDS reflects the hallmark of a critical course of the disease.
NA,Preventing nosocomial infections (primarily by correct use of personal protective equipment) and maintenance of hospitals' operational capability are of utmost importance.
NA,Departments of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and emergency medicine will envisage major challenges.
NA,To systematically analyze CT findings during the early and progressive stages of natural course of coronavirus disease 2019 and also to explore possible changes in pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities during these two stages.
NA,We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China.
NA,Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis.
NA,CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed.
NA,In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%).
NA,No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening.
NA,The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004).
NA,Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease.
NA,If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered.
NA,• Multiple GGOs with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of COVID-19.
NA,• The halo sign may be a special CT feature in the early-stage COVID-19 patients.
NA,• Significantly increased CT score may indicate the aggravation of COVID-19 in the progressive stage.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the characteristics of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, and provide epidemiological evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> The data of all the cluster cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin reported as 22 February 2020 were collected to analyze the characteristics of different types of the clusters. <b>Results:</b> A total of 115 COVID-19 cases were reported in in 33 clusters in Tianjin.
NA,Clusters can be classified as following: 28 familial clusters (71 cases), 1 work place cluster (10 cases), 3 transport vehicle clusters (8 cases) and 1 public place cluster (26 cases).
NA,Fourteen familial clusters were caused by the cases from the working place or public place clusters.
NA,Numbers of secondary cases of family clusters were 1-7, the median number was 7.
NA,The interval from onset to diagnosis for the first case was longer than those of other cases in the familial clusters (Z=-2.406, <i>P</i>= 0.016).
NA,The median of incubation period of the public place clusters was 2 days.
NA,The intervals from onset to diagnosis were significant different among the family, working place and public place clusters (<i>H</i>=8.843, , <i>P</i>=0.012) , and there were also significant differences in onset time among the secondary cases (<i>H</i>=16.607, <i>P</i>=0.000) . <b>Conclusions:</b> In the surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic, special attention should be paid to the cases from same family, same work place, or other places where clustering are prone to occur, and the epidemiological investigation should be carried out timely to confirm the cluster.
NA,To prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the close contacts of the patients should be transferred to an assigned observation place in time for single room isolation.
NA,The awareness of COVID-19 prevention is low in some rural areas, reflected by many mass gathering activities and delayed medical care seeking after onset.
NA,It is necessary to strengthen the health education and take control measures in early period of epidemic. <b>目的：</b> 分析天津市新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）聚集性疫情病例情况，掌握不同类型聚集性病例发病特征，为COVID-19防控提供流行病学证据和经验。

NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.
NA,Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.
NA,Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.
NA,We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.
NA,We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.
NA,We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
NA,We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.
NA,Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
NA,Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.
NA,Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.
NA,Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]).
NA,The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL (IQR 4·1-7·0).
NA,Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0·15, 95% CI -0·19 to -0·11; R<sup>2</sup>=0·71).
NA,In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.
NA,Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074-0·75; p=0·020).
NA,For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).
NA,Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0·9).
NA,No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.
NA,Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.
NA,Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.
NA,This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.

NA,The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
NA,• The proportion of confirmed COVID-19 patients with normal chest CT was relatively high (30.8%); CT was not a suitable screening modality.
NA,To report the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Xiaogan, Hubei, China.
NA,The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively.
NA,Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>) in patients.
NA,Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients.
NA,Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%).
NA,Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%).
NA,Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas.
NA,Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%).
NA,The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%).
NA,CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO<sub>2</sub> and lymphocyte numbers (p&lt;0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively.
NA,Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.
NA,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 - 2.5, indicating that 2 - 3 persons will be infected from an index patient.
NA,A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection.
NA,As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms.
NA,The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures.
NA,Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission.
NA,Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida.
NA,Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system.
NA,These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications.
NA,We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19.
NA,Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed.
NA,Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services.
NA,Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine.
NA,Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.
NA,Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have a high vulnerability and variable capacity to respond to outbreaks.
NA,Many of these countries addressed the need for increasing capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid response to public health threats.
NA,Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that direct the public to actions for self- and community protection.
NA,This viewpoint article aims to highlight the contribution of the Global Health Development (GHD)/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR's Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETPs) to prepare for and respond to the current COVID-19 threat.
NA,GHD/EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through health promotion, training and training materials, guidelines, coordination, and communication.
NA,The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and screening at the ports of entry, development of communication materials and guidelines, and sharing information to health professionals and the public.
NA,However, some countries remain ill-equipped, have poor diagnostic capacity, and are in need of further capacity development in response to public health threats.
NA,It is essential that GHD/EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health emergencies.
NA,To delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.
NA,Retrospective case series.
NA,Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
NA,Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.
NA,Data were collected until 28 February 2020.
NA,Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.
NA,The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).
NA,Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).
NA,Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).
NA,Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).
NA,The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.
NA,Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.
NA,Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.
NA,Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).
NA,Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.
NA,Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.
NA,Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in China and more than 30 countries over last two months.
NA,COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed number of confirmed cases, and the intervention effects of implemented quarantine and control measures.
NA,We develop a Susceptible, Un-quanrantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC) model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models.
NA,The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infections to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China.
NA,We found that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing had a reproductive number <i>R</i> &gt; 1, and after January 30, all regions had a reproductive number <i>R</i> &lt; 1, indicating that the quarantine and control measures are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
NA,The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines.
NA,The number of unquarantined infected cases in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is estimated to be 3,509 and declines to 334 on February 21, 2020.
NA,After fitting the model with data as of February 21, 2020, we predict that the end time of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei is around late March, around mid March for China excluding Hubei, and before early March 2020 for the four tier-one cities.
NA,A total of 80,511 individuals are estimated to be infected in China, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei).
NA,Note that the estimates are from a deterministic ODE model and should be interpreted with some uncertainty.
NA,We suggest that rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before early March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late March in Hubei.
NA,The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other countries at high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran.
NA,The supplementary materials can be found online with this article at 10.1007/s40484-020-0199-0.
NA,Based on the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Edition 5), combined with our current clinical treatment experience, we recently proposed a revision of the first edition of &quot;Guidance for maternal and fetal management during pneumonia epidemics of novel coronavirus infection in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital&quot;.
NA,This article focused on the issues of greatest concern of pregnant women including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnostic criteria, inspection precautions, drug treatment options, indications and methods of termination of pregnancy, postpartum fever, breastfeeding considerations, mode of mother-to-child transmission, neonatal isolation and advice on neonatal nursing, to provide valuable experience for better management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and newborns.
NA,Since December 2019, a series of highly infectious cases of unexplained pneumonia have been discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which have been confirmed as '2019 corona virus disease' caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 virus can invade many human systems including the lungs.
NA,Patients with central nervous system involvement may show a series of neurological symptoms, which is easy to be misdiagnosed and neglected, thereby increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Hereditary ataxia is a large group of neurodegenerative diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and high mortality and disability.
NA,In view of the seriousness of the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the government have restricted the follow-up, diagnosis and treatment of patients by the hospitals, which has a great impact on their mental and physical health.
NA,In order to standardize the management of patients during the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, the Specialized Committee of Neurogenetics of the Neurophysician Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association has formulated this consensus, with an aim to help patients to overcome the difficulties and pass the epidemic prevention period safely.
NA,In this study, we collected a total of 610 hospitalized patients from Wuhan between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020.
NA,We reported a potentially high false negative rate of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak.
NA,We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients.
NA,Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic.
NA,These results suggested the urgent needs for the standard of procedures of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well.
NA,This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection.
NA,The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus.
NA,The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia.
NA,Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far.
NA,In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated.
NA,Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued.
NA,Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment.
NA,In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic.
NA,We studied the epidemiological and clinical data collected from a family with 5 people, in which there were 3 family member diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,We found that the first patient in this family had Wuhan city travel history.
NA,Close contact in daily life was the route of infection.
NA,The most common symptoms were fever, cough and weakness.
NA,Characteristic imaging changes were found with grass opacity (GGO), consolidation and septal thickening mainly distributed in peripheral and posterior area by thoracic CT scan in the 3 patients.
NA,The abnormality in laborotary test included lower white blood cell count, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count，increasing fibrinogen and C-reactive protein，decreasing myohaemoglobin and increasing lactate dehydrogenase.
NA,The epidemiological and clinical features could provide quicker diagnosis and better management for the COVID-19 infected patients.
NA,: Little is known about surgical practice in the initial phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global crisis.
NA,This is a retrospective case series of 4 surgical patients (cholecystectomy, hernia repair, gastric bypass, and hysterectomy) who developed perioperative complications in the first few weeks of COVID-19 outbreak in Tehran, Iran in the month of February 2020.
NA,COVID-19 can complicate the perioperative course with diagnostic challenge and a high potential fatality rate.
NA,In locations with widespread infections and limited resources, the risk of elective surgical procedures for index patient and community may outweigh the benefit.
NA,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.
NA,The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.
NA,A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
NA,Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.
NA,Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.
NA,The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.
NA,The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.
NA,The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.
NA,In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39.
NA,Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).
NA,Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).
NA,The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency.
NA,The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
NA,A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based two target genes (ORF1ab and N).
NA,Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected.
NA,Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging.
NA,In 95 samples tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87). 4 (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral load ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test.
NA,Then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum (17429 ± 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 ± 1965 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001) and nasal swabs (651 ± 501 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001).
NA,Furthermore, the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46800 ± 17272 vs 1252 ± 1027, p &lt; 0.001) analyzed by sputum samples.
NA,Quantitative monitoring of viral load in lower respiratory tract samples helps to evaluate disease progression, especially in cases of low viral load.
NA,The aim is to evaluate pregnant women infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide help for clinical prevention and treatment.
NA,All five cases of pregnant women confirmed COVID-19 were collected among patients who admitted to the Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province between January 20 and February 10, 2020.
NA,All patients, aging from 25 to 31 years old, had the gestational week from 38th weeks to 41st weeks.
NA,All pregnant women did not have an antepartum fever but developed a low-grade fever (37.5℃-38.5℃) within 24 hours after delivery.
NA,All patients had normal liver and renal function, two patients had elevated plasma levels of the myocardial enzyme.
NA,Unusual chest imaging manifestations, featured with ground-grass opacity, were frequently observed in bilateral (three cases) or unilateral lobe (two cases) by computed tomography (CT) scan.
NA,All labors smoothly processed, the Apgar scores were 10 points 1 and 5 minutes after delivery, no complications were observed in the newborn.
NA,Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of patients with COVID-19 should receive more attention.
NA,It is probable that pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 have no fever before delivery.
NA,Their primary initial manifestations were merely low-grade postpartum fever or mild respiratory symptoms.
NA,Therefore, the protective measures are necessary on admission; the instant CT scan and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay should be helpful in early diagnosis and avoid cross-infection on the occasion that patients have fever and other respiratory signs.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 that caused difficulties for clinical work.
NA,Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence-based medical evidence to explore a standardized process of diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases.
NA,Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed.
NA,We hope that our experience in prevention and control of COVID-19 can help spine surgeons globally in stopping the spread of COVID-19.
NA,Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross-infection in hospitals and optimize treatment.
NA,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world.
NA,Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.
NA,We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.
NA,All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.
NA,The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.
NA,We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.
NA,We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.
NA,We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.
NA,Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.
NA,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.
NA,No recommendation was provided for 6 questions.
NA,The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.
NA,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.
NA,When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.
NA,There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID-19.
NA,To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission.
NA,We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak.
NA,With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73).
NA,Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis.
NA,Vomiting was more prominent in children.
NA,About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting.
NA,Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms.
NA,The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found.
NA,Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%).
NA,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces.
NA,Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection.
NA,In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive.
NA,Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days.
NA,Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID-19 patients are potentially infectious.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world.
NA,According to the World Health Organization statement on 13 March 2020, there had been over 132 500 confirmed cases globally.
NA,Nevertheless, the case reports of children are rare, which results in the lack of evidence for preventing and controlling of children's infection.
NA,Here, we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected children diagnosed from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin, China.
NA,All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after the treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, and 7 days after diagnosis, respectively.
NA,However, after been discharged, all three cases were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the stool samples within 10 days, in spite of their remained negative nucleic acid in throat swab specimens.
NA,Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for children cases.
NA,Dermatoscope is a convenient diagnostic tool used by dermatologists in the diagnosis of skin, hair and nail disorders.
NA,During dermoscopy, a dermatoscope comes in contact with the patient and hence can act as a potential source of nosocomial spread of infections.<sup>1</sup> The uncertainty associated with the mode of spread of current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has only lead to confusion and studies are underway to determine the role of zoonotic and environmental factors.<sup>2-4</sup> There are reports of presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on door handles, mobile phones and other surfaces.
NA,COVID-19 has spread globally since its discovery in Hubei province, China in December 2019.
NA,A combination of computed tomography imaging, whole genome sequencing, and electron microscopy were initially used to screen and identify SARS-CoV-2, the viral etiology of COVID-19.
NA,The aim of this review article is to inform the audience of diagnostic and surveillance technologies for SARS-CoV-2 and their performance characteristics.
NA,We describe point-of-care diagnostics that are on the horizon and encourage academics to advance their technologies beyond conception.
NA,Developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak would be useful in preventing future epidemics.
NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations.
NA,Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded.
NA,CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement.
NA,The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was ≤ 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was &gt; 3 days).
NA,The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment.
NA,The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. <b>RESULTS.</b> A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study.
NA,The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively.
NA,The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups.
NA,The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (<i>r</i> = 0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (<i>r</i> = 0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.006). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.
NA,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world.
NA,Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.
NA,We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.
NA,All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.
NA,The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.
NA,We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.
NA,We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.
NA,We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.
NA,Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.
NA,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.
NA,No recommendation was provided for six questions.
NA,The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy.
NA,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.
NA,When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines.
NA,The public health emergency caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant reallocation of health resources with a consequent reorganization of the clinical activities also in several urological centers.
NA,A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on a set of recommendations on pathways of pre-, intra- and post-operative care for urological patients undergoing urgent procedures or non-deferrable oncological interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Simplification of the diagnostic and staging pathway has to be prioritized in order to reduce hospital visits and consequently the risk of contagion.
NA,In absence of strict uniform regulations that impose the implementation of nasopharyngeal swabs, we recommend that an accurate triage for possible COVID-19 symptoms be performed both by telephone at home before hospitalization and at the time of hospitalization.
NA,We recommend that during hospital stay patients should be provided with as many instructions as possible to facilitate their return to, and stay at, home.
NA,Patients should be discharged under stable good conditions in order to minimize the risk of readmission.
NA,It is advisable to reduce or reschedule post-discharge controls and implement an adequate system of communication for telemonitoring discharged patients in order to reduce hospital visits.
NA,As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020.
NA,Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay.
NA,In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases.
NA,The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days.
NA,Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation.
NA,No fatal cases were noted.
NA,The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%).
NA,In the &quot;Severe&quot; group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the &quot;Mild to Moderate&quot; group (p&lt;0.001).
NA,There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens.
NA,Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.
NA,The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
NA,Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
NA,However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
NA,In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
NA,We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
NA,Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has now affected hundreds of thousands of individuals across the world.
NA,Amidst this global pandemic, maintaining a high index of suspicion, rapid testing capacity, and infection control measures are required to curtail the virus' rapid spread.
NA,While fever and respiratory symptoms have been commonly used to identify COVID-19 suspects, we present an elderly female who arrived to the hospital after a syncopal episode.
NA,She was afebrile with a normal chest X-ray and there was no suspicion of COVID-19.
NA,She then developed a fever and tested positive for COVID-19.
NA,Our unique case underscores the increasing diversity of COVID-19 presentations and potential for initial mis- diagnosis and delay in implementing proper precautions.
NA,In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and presented a major threat to public health.
NA,Nationwide, there were more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and 2500 deaths.
NA,Most patients were elderly, with severe disease.
NA,For acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions.
NA,Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces.
NA,Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR.
NA,Three targets, RdRP, E and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2].
NA,After patient recovery, a chest CT examination, combined with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis.
NA,However, some recovery patients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive.
NA,The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC).
NA,This is an important scientific issue.
NA,If samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source.
NA,Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second-generation cases.
NA,We herein report six SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should attract attention.
NA,Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI).
NA,However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail.
NA,Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings.
NA,Similarly, discharged patient follow-up should be strengthened.

NA,We report epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster.
NA,Our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings.
NA,These findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment.
NA,We report the dynamic change process of target genes by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 during the course of a COVID-19 patient: from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene, to two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2, and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case.
NA,In this case, negative results of RT-PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence.
NA,This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
NA,To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, who were examined by both CT and rRT-PCR at initial presentation.
NA,The sensitivities of both tests were then compared.
NA,For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated.
NA,A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT.
NA,Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed.
NA,Amongst these 6 patients, 3 became positive in the second rRT-PCR assay(after 2 days, 2 days and 3 days respectively), and the other 3 became positive only in the third round of rRT-PCR tests(after 5 days, 6 days and 8 days respectively).
NA,At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%. rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results.
NA,We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.
NA,<b>Background:</b> At present, PCR-based nucleic acid detection cannot meet the demands for coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) diagnosis.<b>Methods:</b> 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited.
NA,Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated.<b>Results:</b> Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively.
NA,The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively.
NA,The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA.
NA,We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o.
NA,The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.<b>Conclusions:</b> ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o, it can be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,Whether the patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important issue worthy of clinical attention.
NA,This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.
NA,One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020.

NA,Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (&lt;26 μmol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD).
NA,All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI.
NA,In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19.
NA,In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD.
NA,In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed.
NA,All 5 patients with CKD were survived.
NA,Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD.
NA,AKI was uncommon in COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in AKI, or aggravate CKD in the COVID-19 patients.
NA,The Novel corona virus 2019 which started as an outbreak in China in December 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world, such that on 11th March 2020 WHO declared this disease as pandemic.
NA,The emergency that the world faces today demands that we develop urgent and effective measures to protect people at high risk of transmission.
NA,WHO has accelerated research in diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.
NA,The newly emerged coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was first identified in China in December 2019.
NA,It is a highly contagious infection that can spread from person to person through close contact and respiratory droplets.
NA,The healthcare personnel of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery are especially vulnerable to the infection due to their extensive and close exposure to patients' oral and nasal cavities and secretions.
NA,As one of the busiest specialised hospitals in the world, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology summarised the experience with disease prevention and control and clinical recommendations on the examination, diagnosis and treatment processes, clinical management, healthcare personnel protection and disinfection amid the continued spread of the pandemic.
NA,The rapidly expanding novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has challenged the medical community to an unprecedented degree.
NA,Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care.
NA,Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk.
NA,A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China.
NA,Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients.
NA,The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed.
NA,Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers.
NA,Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices.
NA,Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system.

NA,The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.
NA,While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100 000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities.
NA,Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease.
NA,To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.
NA,In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations.
NA,During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.
NA,Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years.
NA,Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens.
NA,A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions.
NA,By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms.
NA,In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19.
NA,Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.
NA,To evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in non-high-epidemic area in Japan.
NA,This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected.
NA,Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
NA,All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion.
NA,The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77-0.88 for R1 and 0.78-0.92 for R2.
NA,The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC.
NA,Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease of pandemic proportions.
NA,Healthcare workers in Singapore working in high-risk areas were mandated to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 face mask and protective eyewear while attending to patients.
NA,We sought to determine the risk factors associated with the development of de novo PPE-associated headaches as well as the perceived impact of these headaches on their personal health and work performance.
NA,The impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing headache disorders was also investigated.
NA,This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers at our tertiary institution who were working in high-risk hospital areas during COVID-19.
NA,All respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire.
NA,A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study.
NA,Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years.
NA,Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)].
NA,Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents.
NA,Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 5.2 (SD 2.4) hours, P &lt; .0001] or medical ICU [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 2.2 (SD 0.41) hours, P &lt; .0001].
NA,Out of 158 respondents, 128 (81.0%) respondents developed de novo PPE-associated headaches.
NA,A pre-existing primary headache diagnosis (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 1.48-15.40; P = .030) and combined PPE usage for &gt;4 hours per day (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.35-11.31; P = .012) were independently associated with de novo PPE-associated headaches.
NA,Since COVID-19 outbreak, 42/46 (91.3%) of respondents with pre-existing headache diagnosis either &quot;agreed&quot; or &quot;strongly agreed&quot; that the increased PPE usage had affected the control of their background headaches, which affected their level of work performance.
NA,Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities of China is a growing global concern.
NA,Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19.
NA,In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model.
NA,Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection.
NA,More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.
NA,Emergency trauma radiology, although a relatively new subspecialty of radiology, plays a critical role in both the diagnosis/triage of acutely ill patients, but even more important in providing leadership and taking the lead in the preparedness of imaging departments in dealing with novel highly infectious communicable diseases and mass casualties.
NA,This has become even more apparent in dealing with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in late 2019.
NA,We review the symptoms, epidemiology, and testing for this disease.
NA,We discuss characteristic imaging findings of COVID-19 in relation to other modern coronavirus diseases including SARS and MERS.
NA,We discuss roles that community radiology clinics, outpatient radiology departments, and emergency radiology departments can play in the diagnosis of this disease.
NA,We review practical methods to reduce spread of infections within radiology departments.
NA,<i>Satisfactory outcome was observed in one mild case and one severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia after the use of the online/offline multidisciplinary quarantine observation form, online monitoring, and classified diagnosis and treatment, as well as strict compliance with quarantine measures.
NA,Conditions of both patients were improved, and cross-infection and disease onset clustering were not observed.
NA,The multidisciplinary self-quarantine model provides early judgment, identification, and treatment of disease, improves compliance with early rehabilitation, increases confidence in recovery, and enhances self-management capabilities.
NA,This model is applicable to the current novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and can actively promote the management of suspected or confirmed mild cases, monitoring of critical cases, and self-management of discharged patients.
NA,The application of this new management model is worthy of being promoted in our specialized treatment facilities and in countries with severe epidemics.</i>
NA,Background and Purpose- Hyperacute assessment and management of patients with stroke, termed code stroke, is a time-sensitive and high-stakes clinical scenario.
NA,In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team.
NA,Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis.
NA,Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation.
NA,Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed.
NA,Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening.
NA,These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features.
NA,A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke.
NA,We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke.
NA,Conclusions- We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management.
NA,These considerations and suggested algorithms can be utilized and adapted for local practice.
NA,The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the positive of etiological test.
NA,The current etiological test of COVID-19 cost long time, and have high false negative rate, may resulting delay the measures of disease treatment and prevention.
NA,We suggested that COVID-19 should be diagnosed as 3 types: suspected case, clinical diagnosed case, and definite diagnosed case.
NA,新型冠状病毒肺炎的诊断是以病原学检测阳性为确诊标准的，由于现有的病原学检测耗时较长，假阴性率较高，致使疑似病例的确诊时间延长，从而延误后续防治。
NA,本文建议将该病的诊断标准分为疑似病例、临床诊断病例和确诊病例3类。.

NA,Viral respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) always pose a severe threat to people.
NA,First identified in late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2) has affected many provinces in China and multiple countries worldwide.
NA,The viral outbreak has aroused panic and a public-health emergency around the world, and the number of infections continues to rise.
NA,However, the causes and consequences of the pneumonia remain unknown.
NA,To effectively implement epidemic prevention, early identification and diagnosis are critical to disease control.
NA,Here we scrutinise a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection.
NA,In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
NA,Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days.
NA,Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients.
NA,This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19.
NA,Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article.
NA,In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.
NA,This study aims to explore the impact of healthcare digitalization on smart hospital project financing (PF) fostered by pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives.
NA,Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents.
NA,They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks.
NA,Application to healthcare public-private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder's interaction.
NA,In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns.
NA,This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric.
NA,This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case.
NA,Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. &quot;Digital&quot; savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns.
NA,Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected.
NA,This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability.
NA,Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data.
NA,The rapid spread of the epidemic has aroused widespread concern in the international community.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) originated from Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market, with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts.
NA,The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2.
NA,Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection.
NA,The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible.
NA,The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic.
NA,The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days.
NA,The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first.
NA,Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate.
NA,Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts.
NA,With powerful government intervention and the efforts of Chinese medical staff, China's outbreak has gradually improved.
NA,To describe the first isolation and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia and rapid sharing of the isolate.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea.
NA,Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient.
NA,A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction).
NA,Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture.
NA,Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae.
NA,Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
NA,Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections.
NA,The ability to rapidly identify, propagate, and internationally share our SARS-CoV-2 isolate is an important step in collaborative scientific efforts to deal effectively with this international public health emergency by developing better diagnostic procedures, vaccine candidates, and antiviral agents.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in December 2019, is still ongoing in Korea, with &gt;9,000 confirmed cases as of March 25, 2020.
NA,COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR is currently the most reliable diagnostic method for COVID-19 around the world.
NA,Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine and the Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control propose guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical laboratories in Korea.
NA,These guidelines are based on other related domestic and international guidelines, as well as expert opinions and include the selection of test subjects, selection of specimens, diagnostic methods, interpretation of test results, and biosafety.
NA,A 35-year-old woman presented with fever and mild diarrhoea without any respiratory symptoms 9 days after travelling to Japan from Wuhan, China.
NA,Her computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia.
NA,The first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on throat swab for the novel corona virus upon admission was negative.
NA,Therefore, she was treated for community-acquired pneumonia, but fever persisted.
NA,On hospital day 5, PCR test on induced sputum was positive, but a second polymerase chain reaction test on throat swab remained negative.
NA,She was discharged, fully recovered, on hospital day 12.
NA,A lower respiratory tract specimen should be obtained for better diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms for patients with significant travel or exposure history.
NA,This case report underlines the appearance of a &quot;walking pneumonia&quot; in a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient, with evidence of progressive lung involvement on chest imaging studies.
NA,The patient traveled from Wuhan, Hubei, China, to Thailand in January 2020.
NA,One of her family members was diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,She presented to the hospital because of her concern, but she was without fever or any respiratory symptoms.
NA,Three days earlier, her nasopharyngeal and throat swabs revealed a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,Her initial chest radiography was abnormal, and her first sputum SARS-CoV-2 test yielded inconclusive results.
NA,A subsequent sputum test was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Diagnosis in this patient was facilitated by chest imaging and repeat viral testing.
NA,Thus, chest imaging studies might enhance capabilities for early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,The Importance of Diagnostic Testing during a Viral Pandemic: Early Lessons from Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
NA,The impact caused by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in different parts of the world, currently reaches 745, 308 infected and 35,307 deaths according to the latest reports.
NA,In this context, in our country, an area of ​​epidemiological relevance is the Peruvian Amazon, due to the distribution of endemic diseases such as metaxemic diseases (Dengue, Malaria, among others), where the problem increases due to the COVID infection. -19 can lead to false positives in Dengue screening tests.
NA,Thus leading to a delay in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and further spread of the virus, since in most cases of Dengue there are no warning signs and treatment is ambulatory.
NA,This article seeks to express an opinion on the need to address cases of coinfection between Dengue and Covid-19 in endemic areas.
NA,El impacto que ha originado la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en diferentes partes del mundo, alcanza en la actualidad 597, 072 personas contagiadas y 27,364 fallecidas según los últimos reportes.
NA,En ese contexto, en nuestro país, una zona de relevancia epidemiológica es la amazonia peruana, debido a la distribución de enfermedades endémicas como las enfermedades metaxénicas (Dengue, Malaria entre otras), en donde el problema se incrementa debido a que la infección por COVID-19 puede llevar a falsos positivos en las pruebas de cribado para Dengue.
NA,Conllevando de esa forma a un retraso en el diagnóstico de la infección por COVID-19 y una mayor diseminación del virus, debido a que en la mayor parte de los casos de Dengue no se presentan signos de alarma y el tratamiento es ambulatorio.
NA,Este artículo busca emitir una opinión sobre la necesidad del abordaje de casos de coinfección entre Dengue y Covid-19 en zonas endémicas.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic, with over 720,000 cases reported in more than 203 countries as of 31 March.
NA,The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine.
NA,In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
NA,Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015.
NA,An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined.
NA,This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response.
NA,Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations.
NA,In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine.
NA,Several challenges remain for the global use and integration of telemedicine into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.
NA,All stakeholders are encouraged to address the challenges and collaborate to promote the safe and evidence-based use of telemedicine during the current pandemic and future outbreaks.
NA,For countries without integrated telemedicine in their national health care system, the COVID-19 pandemic is a call to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine.
NA,First reported in China, the 2019 novel coronavirus has been spreading across the globe.
NA,Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over.
NA,The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction.
NA,Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care.
NA,Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation.
NA,Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms.
NA,Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers.
NA,Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission.
NA,Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.
NA,During the current rapidly evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants form a special vulnerable group that needs immediate attention.
NA,Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths will continue.
NA,Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.
NA,The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline.
NA,A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted.
NA,The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care.
NA,An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize.
NA,Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations.
NA,Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed.
NA,For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles.
NA,The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations.
NA,To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.
NA,A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China.
NA,The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002.
NA,Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level.
NA,As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed.
NA,Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective.
NA,In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19.
NA,Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.
NA,To subjectively and objectively evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of a low-dose, long-pitch dual-source chest CT protocol on third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) with spectral shaping at 100Sn kVp for COVID-19 patients.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included.
NA,The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT).
NA,Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded.
NA,Nonparametric tests were used.
NA,The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs.
NA,3.28 mSv, p = 0.016).
NA,LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016).
NA,SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma.
NA,Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT.
NA,Ultra-low-dose, dual-source, fast CT protocol provides highly diagnostic images for COVID-19 with potential for reduction in dose and motion artifacts.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity.
NA,Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown.
NA,We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China.
NA,The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020.
NA,Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection.
NA,Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure.
NA,High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (≥10 minutes within 2 meters).
NA,Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S.
NA,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions.
NA,Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points.
NA,In 8 pairs (73%), ≥1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative.
NA,Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive.
NA,Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure.
NA,In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative.
NA,This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts.
NA,These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.
NA,On 31 December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and caused the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,To date, computed tomography (CT) findings have been recommended as major evidence for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China.
NA,This review focuses on the imaging characteristics and changes throughout the disease course in patients with COVID-19 in order to provide some help for clinicians.
NA,Typical CT findings included bilateral ground-glass opacity, pulmonary consolidation, and prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral parts of the lungs.
NA,This review also provides a comparison between COVID-19 and other diseases that have similar CT findings.
NA,Since most patients with COVID-19 infection share typical imaging features, radiological examinations have an irreplaceable role in screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects in clinical practice.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, spread rapidly throughout China, and gradually to some countries abroad.
NA,How to control the development of the epidemic?
NA,Early diagnosis is one of the important contents in prevention and control.
NA,COVID-19 patients with early mild pneumonia often lack typical evidence to make a definitive diagnosis.
NA,Based on the analysis of the cases of 4 patients, this article finds that early diagnosis requires a combination of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, imaging, and etiology, with particular emphasis on epidemiology history and chest CT manifestations.
NA,To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province.
NA,National surveillance studies, 2008-17. 31 provinces in mainland China.
NA,4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases.
NA,The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne.
NA,Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases.
NA,From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females).
NA,The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males.
NA,Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017.
NA,Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared.
NA,The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza.
NA,Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017.
NA,The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline.
NA,Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria.
NA,Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza.
NA,Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017.
NA,Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males.
NA,Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases.
NA,China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare.
NA,Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,South Africa is in the grip of a novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
NA,Primary care providers are in the frontline.
NA,COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets contaminating surfaces and hands that then transmit the virus to another person's respiratory system.
NA,The incubation period is 2-9 days and the majority of cases are mild.
NA,The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
NA,Older people and those with cardiopulmonary co-morbidities or immunological deficiency will be more at risk of severe disease.
NA,If people meet the case definition, the primary care provider should immediately adopt infection prevention and control measures.
NA,Diagnosis is made by a RT-PCR test using respiratory secretions, usually nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.
NA,Mild cases can be managed at home with self-isolation, symptomatic treatment and follow-up if the disease worsens.
NA,Contact tracing is very important.
NA,Observed case fatality is between 0.5% and 4%, but may be overestimated as mild cases are not always counted.
NA,Primary care providers must give clear, accurate and consistent messages on infection prevention and control in communities and homes.
NA,Currently, the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun to spread worldwide.
NA,We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID-19 since the outbreak.
NA,A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta-analysis.
NA,Overall, 31 articles and 46 959 patients were included, including 10 English articles and 21 Chinese articles.
NA,The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%; 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%; 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%; 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%; 0.253-0.456), and chest distress (31.2%; -0.024 to 0.648).
NA,The main imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%; 0.639-0.871) and ground-glass opacification (69.9%; 0.602-0.796).
NA,Among the patients, the incidence that required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%; 0.190-0.395), the incidence with acute respiratory distress syndrome was (28.8%; 0.147-0.429), the incidence with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was (8.5%; -0.008 to 0.179), and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 was (6.8%; 0.044-0.093).
NA,COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease that mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly.
NA,Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to present respiratory failure or even death.
NA,Background The standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, but chest CT may play a complimentary role in the early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Purpose To investigate CT features of patients with COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, and to compare the accuracy of CT with RT-PCR.
NA,Methods In this prospective study from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled.

NA,All patients underwent RT-PCR and chest CT.
NA,Diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using RT-PCR as reference.
NA,Chest CT features were calculated in a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients.
NA,CT features of hospitalized patients and patient in home isolation were compared by using Pearson chi squared test.
NA,Results Our study population comprised 158 consecutive study participants (83 male and 75 female, mean age 57 y ±17).
NA,Fever was observed in 97/158 (61%), cough in 88/158 (56%), dyspnea in 52/158 (33%), lymphocytopenia in 95/158 (60%), increased C-reactive protein level in 139/158 (88%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase in 128/158 (81%) study participants.
NA,Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT were 97% (60/62)[95% IC, 88-99%], 56% (54/96)[95% IC,45-66%] and 72% (114/158)[95% IC 64-78%], respectively.
NA,In the subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients, ground-glass opacities (GGO) were present in 58/58 (100%), multilobe and posterior involvement were both present in 54/58 (93%), bilateral pneumonia in 53/58 (91%), and subsegmental vessel enlargement (&gt; 3 mm) in 52/58 (89%) of study participants.
NA,Conclusion The typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Rome, Italy, was peripherally ground-glass opacities with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (&gt; 3 mm).
NA,Chest CT sensitivity was high (97%) but with lower specificity (56%).
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become a global pandemic.
NA,This has led the United States to declare a national emergency and a ban on all elective diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as well as elective surgery in inpatient and outpatient settings.
NA,Ambulatory surgery facilities that perform only elective procedures are thus likely to be closed.
NA,However, these facilities may be able assist acute care hospitals, as essential (urgent and emergent) surgeries and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures will still need to be performed.
NA,The aim of this article is explore the potential contribution of ASFs in the current healthcare crisis.
NA,It is important to understand that COVID-19-related information is continually evolving, and thus, the discussion provided here is subject to change.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since March 2020.
NA,We describe here, two cases of COVID-19 infection in a post-transplant setting.
NA,First one is a 59-year old renal transplant recipient; the second is a 51-year old allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient.
NA,Both patients were on immunosuppressant therapy and had stable graft function before COVID-19 infection.
NA,After the diagnosis of COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents were discontinued and methylprednisolone with prophylactic antibiotics were initiated, however, the lung injury progressed.
NA,The T cells were extremely low in both patients after infection.
NA,Both patients died despite the maximal mechanical ventilatory support.
NA,Therefore, the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia following transplantation is not optimistic and remains guarded.
NA,Lower T cell count may be a surrogate for poor outcome.
NA,Coronavirus infections are a continuous threat raised time and again.
NA,With the recent emergence of novel virulent strains, these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health.
NA,Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic <i>alphacoronavirus</i> PED virus (PEDV).
NA,In the absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical.
NA,Early detection and differential diagnosis of PEDV infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease.
NA,Therefore, there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols, no-wash, high-throughput immunoassays.
NA,This study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against PEDV under experimental and field conditions using a rapid, sensitive, luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaLISA).
NA,PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection.
NA,PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure.
NA,Remarkably, the serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study, lasting longer than the serum IgG response.
NA,Overall, AlphaLISA allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of use.
NA,Particularly, the bridge assay constitutes a rapid diagnostic that substantially improves upon the &quot;time to result&quot; metric of currently available immunoassays.
NA,In this Commentary, we would like to comment on the article titled &quot;A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)&quot; as a featured article in Military Medical Research.
NA,In the guideline, except for &quot;confirmed cases&quot;, &quot;suspected cases&quot;, &quot;close contact&quot; and &quot;suspicious exposure&quot; were defined by clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and auxiliary examination.
NA,Combined with our experience, we introduced a simple scoring proposal additionally based on not only CT imaging as strongly recommended by the guideline but also blood routine test, especially for primary screening of such patients in the out-patient department.
NA,On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
NA,However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
NA,In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of &quot;suspected case&quot; and &quot;confirmed case&quot; according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak has had a major impact on clinical microbiology laboratories in the past several months.
NA,This commentary covers current issues and challenges for the laboratory diagnosis of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In the pre-analytical stage, collecting the proper respiratory tract specimen at the right time from the right anatomic site is essential for a prompt and accurate molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Appropriate measures are required to keep laboratory staff safe while producing reliable test results.
NA,In the analytic stage, real-time RT-PCR assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools.
NA,In the postanalytical stage, testing results should be carefully interpreted using both molecular and serological findings.
NA,Finally, random access, integrated devices available at the point of care with scalable capacities will facilitate the rapid and accurate diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections and greatly assist in the control of this outbreak.
NA,BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the imaging manifestations of early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to provide imaging basis for early detection of suspected cases and stratified intervention.
NA,MATERIAL AND METHODS From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital.
NA,These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19.
NA,All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records.
NA,RESULTS CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected.
NA,Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement.
NA,Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions.
NA,There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle.
NA,Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign,1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign.
NA,CONCLUSIONS The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses.
NA,Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.
NA,Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely throughout the world since the end of 2019.
NA,Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19.
NA,In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56 °C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT.
NA,However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.
NA,We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT.
NA,We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads.
NA,We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT.
NA,Our work showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation.
NA,Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing.
NA,The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation.
NA,Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
NA,Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.
NA,The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia.
NA,In Northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China.
NA,Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak.
NA,We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care unit(s) (ICU) for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated ICU in personal protective equipment use and patient management.
NA,Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad-hoc training.
NA,Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented.
NA,Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required a multidisciplinary, multilevel involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety.
NA,Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and update on a daily basis.
NA,Acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China.
NA,Children and adults show a different clinical course.
NA,The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present.
NA,The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively.
NA,All children were family clusters.
NA,The total adult patients were differentiated into: the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan.
NA,The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%) &amp; 1 (4%), respectively.
NA,The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (range 3-12 days) and 4 days (range 2-12 days), respectively.
NA,Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%).
NA,On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20, 80%). 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=0.014).
NA,A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs.
NA,4%, P=0.004).
NA,Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children.
NA,In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.

NA,In the 5th February 2020 issue of Journal of Medical Virology a paper was published by Giovannetti et al., entitled &quot;The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: where they come from?
NA,&quot;<sup>1</sup> .
NA,In this paper a phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis was applied to the virus identified in the first two subjects diagnosed in Italy with 2019-nCoV infection, recently renamed SARS-CoV-2<sup>2</sup> , two Chinese spouses arrived in Italy for tourism.
NA,The diagnosis was performed by the virology team under direction of Maria R.

NA,Given the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to divulge all the available technologies with the potential to fight against this virus.
NA,Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, and diagnosis.
NA,The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results.
NA,Thus far, some companies have started developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines.
NA,In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks.
NA,The key aspects that will define the exploitation of this technology in the fight against COVID-19 are discussed.
NA,As part of the response plans for the current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), authorities are drafting and implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to slow down transmission and reduce the infection rate.
NA,A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures.
NA,The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva.
NA,Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland.
NA,Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020.
NA,From February 25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total views=332).
NA,User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD 14.4) users per day in this period as compared to the previous weeks (mean 26.4, SD 9.8; P&lt;.001).
NA,In addition, session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period (P&lt;.001).
NA,In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the app.
NA,On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3).
NA,The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus-related information seemed to be an effective and time-saving communication channel within our institution during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
NA,Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice.
NA,More research should be done on the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.
NA,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which has been characterized by fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as shedding of virus RNA into feces.
NA,We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool, and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong.
NA,We collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (n=59; diagnosis from February 2 through Feb 29, 2020), and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and three Chinese databases through March 11, 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
NA,We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model.
NA,Among the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA.
NA,Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P=.02).
NA,The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log<sub>10</sub>cpm in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log<sub>10</sub>cpm in patients without diarrhea (P=.06).
NA,In a meta-analysis of 60 studies, comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%-24.5%); 11.8% of patients with non-severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1%-29.1%) and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9%-36.7%).
NA,In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3%-57.9%); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6%-85.1%).
NA,In an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,Virus RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% patients-even in stool collected after respiratory samples tested negative.
NA,Healthcare workers should therefore exercise caution in collecting fecal samples or performing endoscopic procedures in patients with COVID-19-even during patient recovery.
NA,Hong Kong has been recently attacked by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In late January 2020, it's shown a steadily increasing trend of confirmed cases.
NA,There is a 257 in total infected cases confirmed including 4 deaths until 20<sup>th</sup> of March 2020.
NA,To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.
NA,To investigate the diagnostic value of serological test and dynamitic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,We retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with suspected infection who were finally excluded.
NA,The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis.
NA,Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificity were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.
NA,In COVID-19 group, IgM positive rate almost increased first then decreased over time, however, IgG positive rate increased till 100% and was higher than IgM all the time.
NA,IgM positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after viral negative.
NA,IgG positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after viral negative.
NA,However, the median titer of IgG after viral negative was twice than that before with significant difference.
NA,Viral serological test is an effective diagnostic means for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The positive rate and titer variance of IgG are higher than that of IgM in COVID-19.
NA,In the global emergency scenario caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the Urology residents' training might be critically affected.
NA,To provide insights on this issue, a 25-items online Survey was sent to all Italian residents one month after the first case of COVID-19 in Italy, to evaluate their routine involvement in &quot;clinical&quot; (on-call duty, outpatient visits, diagnostic procedures) and &quot;surgical&quot; (endoscopic, open and minimally invasive surgery) training activities before and during the COVID-19 period.
NA,Overall, 351/577 (60.8%) residents completed the Survey.
NA,Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of residents routinely involved in &quot;clinical&quot; and &quot;surgical&quot; activities ranged from 79.8% to 87.2% and from 49.3% to 73.5%, respectively.
NA,In the COVID-19 period, the proportion of residents experiencing a severe reduction (&gt;40%) or complete suppression (&gt;80%) of training exposure ranged between 41.1% and 81.2% for &quot;clinical&quot; activities while between 44.2% and 62.1% for &quot;surgical&quot; activities.
NA,This reduction was even more pronounced for residents attending the final year of training.
NA,Our study is the first to provide real-life data on how Urology residency training can be impaired during an emergency period.
NA,To address this challenge, strategies aiming to increase the use of telemedicine, smart learning programs and tele-mentoring of surgical procedures, are warranted.
NA,With more than 900,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50,000 deaths during the first three months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis.
NA,The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases.
NA,For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment.
NA,While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances.
NA,Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints.
NA,To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints.
NA,Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.
NA,The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.
NA,On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology.
NA,Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered.
NA,Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action.
NA,In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
NA,Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak.
NA,Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting.
NA,Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed.
NA,In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review.
NA,From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology.
NA,For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled.
NA,Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols.
NA,Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.
NA,The main strategy of the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the control of COVID-19 is active case finding using electronic tools, taking advantage of the capacity of the national primary health care (PHC) network, and community engagement.
NA,To accomplish this, all people are asked to participate in the screening process using the MOH's self-assessment portal (salamat.gov.ir).
NA,Health workers and public volunteers actively contact suspected cases using information recorded in this portal, as well as the electronic health record (SIB portal).
NA,They actively evaluate individuals, follow-up them, and provide them with necessary information.
NA,Where needed, clients are referred to 16-hour treatment clinics, which are specifically set up for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, to the hospitals, or will be treated at home.
NA,The preliminary results of this national campaign (launched nationwide last week) is provided in this factsheet.
NA,There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 as a new emerging epidemic.
NA,In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable.
NA,However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic.
NA,Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities.
NA,The role of laboratory parameters in screening of COVID-19 cases has not been definitely established.
NA,This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19.
NA,This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020.
NA,Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC).
NA,Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male).
NA,The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases.
NA,Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum.
NA,In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others.
NA,ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively.
NA,Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test.
NA,They can help in detection of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, but information about children with COVID-19 is limited.
NA,This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China.
NA,We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha.
NA,Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed.
NA,Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020.
NA,By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha.
NA,Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days.
NA,The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms.
NA,Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan.
NA,As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged.
NA,The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days.
NA,The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients.
NA,Children who have a familial clustering or have a family member with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China.
NA,Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities.
NA,However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms.
NA,To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made.
NA,Contacts were identified and risk categorized as 'close' or 'casual' for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance.
NA,Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of 'close contact'.
NA,At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts.
NA,The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period.
NA,Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.
NA,In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
NA,A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No.
NA,MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community.
NA,This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus.
NA,Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies.
NA,In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies.
NA,Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures.
NA,The current outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has reached multiple countries worldwide.
NA,While the number of newly diagnosed cases and fatalities is rising quickly, far-reaching measures were enacted to prevent further spread.
NA,Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, exposure history, PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract together with computed tomography (CT) imaging.
NA,One of the hallmarks of a critical course of COVID-19 is the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,As management of COVID-19 can be considered a multi-disciplinary approach involving various medical specialties, we here review the first <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT scans of COVID-19 to discuss how Nuclear Medicine could contribute to management of this disease.
NA,Der Ausbruch des Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 hat inzwischen viele Länder weltweit erreicht.
NA,Trotz weitreichender Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Ausbreitung steigen die Fallzahlen kontinuierlich weiter.
NA,Die Diagnose der durch SARS-CoV-2 hervorgerufenen COVID-19 Erkrankung erfolgt mittels Polymerasekettenreaktion aus Proben des Respirationstrakts und computertomographischer Bildgebung der Lunge.
NA,Die Erkrankung kann asymptomatisch oder mild verlaufen und sich mit Fieber oder trockenem Husten manifestieren.
NA,Eine gefürchtete schwere Verlaufsform von COVID-19 ist die Entwicklung eines ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
NA,Da insbesondere schwere Krankheitsverläufe oftmals eine multidisziplinäre Vorgehensweise erfordern, besprechen wir hier anhand einiger <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT Fallbeispiele, welche Rolle die Nuklearmedizin bei COVID-19 einnehmen könnte.
NA,Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death worldwide, with sleep disordered breathing being a further aggravating factor.
NA,Respiratory illnesses are the third leading cause of death amongst the noncommunicable diseases.
NA,The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, also highlights the impact of communicable respiratory syndromes.
NA,In the clinical routine, prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability worsens the patient outcome.
NA,Even though early and continuous, long-term cardiorespiratory monitoring has been proposed or even proven to be beneficial in several situations, implementations thereof are sparse.
NA,We employed our recently presented, multimodal patch stethoscope to estimate Einthoven electrocardiogram (ECG) Lead I and II from a single 55 mm ECG lead.
NA,Using the stethoscope and ECG subsystems, the pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) were estimated.
NA,ECG-derived respiration techniques were used in conjunction with a novel, phonocardiogram-derived respiration approach to extract respiratory parameters.
NA,Medical-grade references were the SOMNOmedics SOMNO HD<sup>TM</sup> and Osypka ICON-Core<sup>TM</sup>.
NA,In a study including 10 healthy subjects, we analyzed the performances in the supine, lateral, and prone position.
NA,Einthoven I and II estimations yielded correlations exceeding 0.97.
NA,LVET and PEP estimation errors were 10% and 21%, respectively.
NA,Respiratory rates were estimated with mean absolute errors below 1.2 bpm, and the respiratory signal yielded a correlation of 0.66.
NA,We conclude that the estimation of ECG, PEP, LVET, and respiratory parameters is feasible using a wearable, multimodal acquisition device and encourage further research in multimodal signal fusion for respiratory signal estimation.
NA,There have been tremendous advances in in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 employ real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours.
NA,But the assay duration has been shortened to 45 min by Cepheid.
NA,Of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay by Abbott that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min.
NA,Most molecular tests have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) and are Conformité Européenne (CE) marked.
NA,A wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), manual ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The ongoing research efforts and advances in complementary technologies will pave the way to new POC IVD assays in the coming months.
NA,However, the performance of IVD assays needs to be critically evaluated before they are employed for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,In the case of pandemic crisis situations, a crucial lack of protective material such as protective face masks for healthcare professionals can occur.
NA,A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability.
NA,The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane).
NA,Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application.
NA,3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software.
NA,The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry.
NA,Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band.
NA,A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed.
NA,Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations.
NA,This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.
NA,The surface tessellation language (STL) format of the original virtual templates of the two reusable components described in this paper can be downloaded free of charge using the hyperlink (Supplementary Material online).
NA,To report the ocular characteristics and the presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival swab specimens in a patient with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset.
NA,Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs.
NA,The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated.
NA,Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis.
NA,RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31).
NA,The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset.
NA,On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness.
NA,Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection.
NA,However, conjunctival sampling might not be useful for early diagnosis because the virus may not appear initially in the conjunctiva.
NA,To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia.
NA,Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal.
NA,PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020.
NA,Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.
NA,At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included.
NA,Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay.
NA,Only one study used patient data from outside of China.
NA,The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms.
NA,The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count.
NA,C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models).
NA,All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting.
NA,Reporting quality varied substantially between studies.
NA,Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed.
NA,Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed.
NA,This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic.
NA,Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones.
NA,The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models.
NA,Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.
NA,Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

NA,A novel viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cases in China and worldwide.
NA,Four full-term, singleton infants were born to pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, where the disease was first identified.
NA,Of the three infants, for who consent to be diagnostically tested was provided, none tested positive for the virus.
NA,None of the infants developed serious clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or abnormal radiologic or hematologic evidence, and all four infants were alive at the time of hospital discharge.
NA,Two infants had rashes of unknown etiology at birth, and one had facial ulcerations.
NA,One infant had tachypnea and was supported by non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 3 days.
NA,One had rashes at birth but was discharged without parental consent for a diagnostic test.
NA,This case report describes the clinical course of four live born infants, born to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.
NA,The definite diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on the viral isolation or positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from sputum, or nasal swab, or throat swab.
NA,However, the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 of real time (RT)-PCR is reported to be lower than that of chest CT.
NA,We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab.
NA,Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks.
NA,The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission.
NA,It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results.
NA,The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization.
NA,The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission.
NA,This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012.
NA,COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world.
NA,The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities.
NA,Children are pauci- or asymptomatic.
NA,The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods.
NA,In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic.
NA,It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested.
NA,The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission.
NA,Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.
NA,La communauté internationale fait actuellement face à une pandémie de syndrome respiratoire aigu due à un nouveau coronavirus, le SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Ce syndrome a été nommé COVID-19 pour COronaVIrus Disease 2019 par l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé.
NA,Le point de départ de l’épidémie est la ville de Wuhan (Chine), où le virus aurait été transmis de l’animal à l’homme préalablement à la transmission inter-humaine.
NA,Il s’agit de la 3ème épidé¬mie causée par un coronavirus après celles du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SARS) en 2003 et du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (MERS) débutée en 2012.
NA,Le COVID-19 s’est rapidement propagé en Chine et se répand actuellement à travers le monde entier.
NA,L’infection touche surtout les patients de plus de 40 ans et la mortalité est accrue en présence de comorbidités.
NA,Les enfants sont, quant à eux, pauci- ou asymptomatiques.
NA,Le diagnostic repose, le plus souvent, sur la détection du génome viral au niveau du nasopharynx par des méthodes de biologie moléculaire.
NA,En l’absence de molécules anti-virales spéci¬fiques, le traitement reste, à l’heure actuelle, principalement symptomatique.
NA,Force est de constater que la pandémie de COVID-19 est plus difficile à contrôler que ce que les premières données ne laissaient présager.
NA,L’élément clé face au SARS-CoV-2 est de limiter sa transmission.
NA,Les mesures de prévention reposent, principalement, sur l’application de mesures d’hygiène des mains adéquates et la désinfection de l’environnement, ainsi que sur des mesures de distance sociale visant à limiter les contacts dans la population et à protéger les populations à risque.
NA,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic initially presented in the United States in the greater Seattle area, and has rapidly progressed across the nation in the past 2 months, with the United States having the highest number of cases in the world.
NA,Radiology departments play a critical role in policy and guideline development both for the department and for the institutions, specifically in planning diagnostic screening, triage, and management of patients.
NA,In addition, radiology workflows, volumes and access must be optimized in preparation for the expected COVID-19 patient surges.
NA,This article discusses the processes that have been implemented at the University of Washington in managing the COVID-19 pandemic as well in preparing for patient surges, which may provide important guidance for other radiology departments who are in the early stages of preparation and management.
NA,A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic.
NA,Although molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed.
NA,Validated serologic assays are needed for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir, and epidemiologic studies.
NA,We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein-specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies.
NA,Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs.
NA,We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset.
NA,We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity, and sensitivity varied between the 2 assays; the IgA ELISA showed higher sensitivity.
NA,Overall, the validated assays described can be instrumental for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiologic, and vaccine evaluation studies.
NA,Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
NA,Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques.
NA,To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance.
NA,It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC.
NA,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
NA,Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
NA,Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
NA,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
NA,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.

NA,It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency.
NA,The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities.
NA,There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists.
NA,Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives.
NA,A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter).
NA,All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory.
NA,Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient.
NA,Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer.
NA,For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases).
NA,For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.
NA,The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.
NA,The Covid-19 pandemic imposes new diagnostic strategies in order to optimize the medical care of our patients.
NA,The current biblio-graphy, although of low quality, shows a sensitivity of 56 to 83 % for the Covid-19 PCR.
NA,Even though one negative test can exclude a Covid-19 in the majority of cases, the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) decreases with increasing prevalence (pre-test probability).
NA,This finding suggests the need for strict auto-isolation of patients until the resolution of their symptoms.
NA,For patients that present with typical symptoms, who have a presumed Covid-19 prevalence of -40-50 %, a negative test should be interpreted with caution and a repeat test may be needed.
NA,La pandémie actuelle du Covid-19 impose une stratégie diagnostique pour la prise en charge des patients.
NA,La performance du frottis nasopharyngé avec analyse par PCR peut être estimée sur la base des premières données bibliographiques.
NA,Celles-ci, certes de qualité faible, montrent une sensibilité de 56 à 83 % pour la PCR Covid-19.
NA,Un seul test négatif permet d’infirmer un Covid-19 dans la majorité des situations.
NA,Cependant, comme la valeur ­prédictive négative du test se situe entre 88 et 95 % en cas de ­probabilité prétest de 30 %, il est indispensable d’assurer le suivi de ces patients.
NA,Pour ceux qui présentent des symptômes typiques, qui auraient une probabilité prétest présumée à 40-50 %, un test négatif doit être interprété avec précaution et un deuxième test peut être indiqué.
NA,Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives.
NA,Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a <i>global pandemic</i> by March of 2020.
NA,Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society.
NA,Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many.
NA,The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future.
NA,However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care.
NA,In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research.
NA,As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, the People's Republic of China, in December 2019 and now is a pandemic all around the world.
NA,Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19.
NA,We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan.
NA,A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices.
NA,To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted.
NA,A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19.
NA,The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%.
NA,The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic.
NA,The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%).
NA,There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%).
NA,Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12).
NA,Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]).
NA,Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15).
NA,Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19.
NA,Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Common places of work could be contaminated.
NA,Orthopaedic surgeons have to be more vigilant and take more precautions to avoid infection with COVID-19.
NA,Diagnostic Level IV.
NA,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
NA,In late December 2019, a viral pneumonia known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated from China and spread very rapidly in the world.
NA,Since then, COVID-19 has become a global concern and health problem.
NA,We present four patients in this study, selected from among patients who presented with pneumonia symptoms and were suspicious for COVID-19.
NA,They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran.
NA,Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase- polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,The samples were also tested for influenza viruses and the complete respiratory panel.
NA,In the present report, four patients were diagnosed in the starting days of COVID-19 disease in our center in southern Iran with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.
NA,This co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza A highlights the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay regardless of other positive findings for other pathogens in the primary test during the epidemic.
NA,On March 11th 2020, the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO.
NA,One of the groups that is considered high risk in this pandemic are cancer patients as they are treated with a variety of immune system suppressor treatment modalities and this puts them in a great risk for infectious disease (including COVID-19).
NA,Therefore, cancer patients require higher level measures for preventing and treating infectious diseases. furthermore, cancer patients may bear additional risk due to the restriction of access to the routine diagnostic and therapeutic services during such epidemic.
NA,Since most of the attention of health systems is towards patients affected with COVID-19, the need for structured and unified approaches to COVID-19 prevention and care specific to cancer patients and cancer centers is felt more than ever.
NA,This article provides the recommendations and possible actions that should be considered by patients, their caregivers and families, physician, nurses, managers and staff of medical centers involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
NA,We pursued two major goals in our recommendations: first, limiting the exposure of cancer patients to medical environments and second, modifying the treatment modalities in a manner that reduces the probability of myelosuppression such as delaying elective diagnostic and therapeutic services, shortening the treatment course, or prolonging the interval between treatment courses.
NA,Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China.
NA,Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus.
NA,The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast.
NA,Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy.
NA,In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care.
NA,Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection.
NA,In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.
NA,In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which has subsequently affected more than 200 countries worldwide including Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and other places.
NA,The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing.
NA,To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China.
NA,To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19.
NA,Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020.
NA,Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed.
NA,The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results.
NA,Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 ± 11.32, 5 males).
NA,No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P &gt; 0.05).
NA,No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P &lt; 0.05).
NA,Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc.
NA,The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas.
NA,Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.
NA,On February 27, 2020, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) identified its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with probable community transmission (i.e., infection among persons without a known exposure by travel or close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19).
NA,At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1).
NA,To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County.
NA,During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites.
NA,For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers.
NA,A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza.
NA,Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection.
NA,This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County.
NA,As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies.
NA,Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2).
NA,Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.
NA,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic.
NA,Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission.
NA,Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key.
NA,ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management.
NA,Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed.
NA,Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies.
NA,Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.
NA,A pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently emerged in China.
NA,It was recognized as a global health hazard. 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included.
NA,Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded, and ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified.
NA,Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated.
NA,Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history.
NA,Fever and cough were main symptoms.
NA,Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes.
NA,GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping.
NA,There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups.
NA,The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P&lt;0.05).
NA,A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P&lt;0.05).
NA,Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
NA,While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide.
NA,As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside.
NA,Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general.
NA,This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including <i>in vitro</i> model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery.
NA,COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need.
NA,Impact statement Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks.
NA,Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks.
NA,Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside.
NA,In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.
NA,Pediatric coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) infection is relatively mild when compared to adults, and children are reported to have a better prognosis.
NA,Mortality in children appears rare.
NA,Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute to transmission.
NA,It remains unclear why children and young adults are less severely affected than older individuals, but this might involve differences in immune system function in the elderly and/or differences in the expression/function of the cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
NA,Laboratory findings and chest imaging may not be specific in children with COVID-19.
NA,Diagnosis is by Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of upper or lower respiratory tract secretions.
NA,This review additionally considers COVID-19 in immunosuppressed children, and also suggests a management algorithm for the few children who appear to present with life threatening infection, including the potential use of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment.
NA,The most significant threat to global child health from SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be related to COVID 19 in children, but rather the socio-economic consequences of a prolonged pandemic.
NA,To analyze the roles of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
NA,Of the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded.
NA,Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7±3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3±0.6) times per case.
NA,With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
NA,Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged; there was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization; there were no deaths and no medical staff infections.
NA,The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved under MDT mode, particularly for complicated and refractory cases.
NA,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), spreading from Wuhan, China, is one of the causes of respiratory infections that can spread to other people through respiratory particles, and can cause symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anorexia, fatigue and sore throat in infected patients.
NA,This review summarizes current strategies on the diagnosis.
NA,Additionally, treatments, infection prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 are addressed.
NA,In addition to the respiratory system, this virus can infect the digestive system, the urinary system and the haematological system, which causes to observe the virus in the stool, urine and blood samples in addition to throat sample.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 causes changes in blood cells and factors and makes lung abnormalities in patients, which can be detected by serological, molecular, and radiological techniques by detecting these changes and injuries.
NA,Radiological and serological methods are the most preferred among the other methods and the radiological method is the most preferred one which can diagnose the infection quickly and accurately with fewer false-negatives, that can be effective in protecting the patient's life by initiating treatment and preventing the transmission of infection to other people.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is serious and has the potential to become an epidemic worldwide.
NA,Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue.
NA,However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations.
NA,To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19.
NA,This is a retrospective, observational case series.
NA,Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.
NA,The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
NA,Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists.
NA,Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations.
NA,Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status.
NA,Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations.
NA,Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough.
NA,Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).
NA,Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations.
NA,During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic is now a global health concern.
NA,We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, CT images and treatment of COVID-19 patients from three different cities in China. 476 patients were recruited from Jan 1 to Feb 15, 2020 at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai and Anhui.
NA,Patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical group) according to the fifth version of the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China on Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19.
NA,Compared with moderate group (37.8%), the incidence of comorbidities was higher in severe (46.3%) and critical groups (67.1%).
NA,Compared with severe and critical groups, there were more patients taking ACEI/ARB in moderate group.
NA,More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group as compared to moderate group.
NA,Compared with the moderate group, more patients received antiviral agents within first 4 days than in severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteriods in critical and severe groups.
NA,Patients over 75 years old had significantly lower survival rate than the younger patients.
NA,Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of severe and critical patients.
NA,There was a significant difference in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers usage among patients with different severities.
NA,Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19.
NA,Advanced age (≥75 years) was a risk factor for mortality.

NA,To report the methods and findings of two complete autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive individuals who died in Oklahoma (United States) in March 2020.
NA,Complete postmortem examinations were performed according to standard procedures in a negative-pressure autopsy suite/isolation room using personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, eye protection, and gowns.
NA,The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing on postmortem swabs.
NA,A 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension, splenectomy, and 6 days of fever and chills died while being transported for medical care.
NA,He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs.
NA,Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa.
NA,A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough.
NA,Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative.
NA,Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration.
NA,Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 testing can be performed at autopsy.
NA,Autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation reflect true virus-related pathology; other findings represent superimposed or unrelated processes.
NA,Ultrasound imaging of the lung and associated tissues may play an important role in the management of patients with COVID-19 associated lung injury.
NA,Compared to other monitoring modalities, such as auscultation or radiographic imaging, we argue lung ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy, is ergonomically favourable and has fewer infection control implications.
NA,By informing the initiation, escalation, titration and weaning of respiratory support, lung ultrasound can be integrated into COVID-19 care pathways for patients with respiratory failure.
NA,Given the unprecedented pressure on healthcare services currently, supporting and educating clinicians is a key enabler of the wider implementation of lung ultrasound.
NA,This narrative review provides a summary of evidence and clinical guidance for the use and interpretation of lung ultrasound for patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 associated lung injury.
NA,Mechanisms by which the potential lung ultrasound workforce can be deployed are explored, including a pragmatic approach to training, governance, imaging, interpretation of images and implementation of lung ultrasound into routine clinical practice.
NA,Evidence strongly supports that access to specialty gastroenterology or hepatology care in cirrhosis is associated with higher adherence to guideline-recommended care and improves clinical outcomes.
NA,Presently, only about one half of acute care hospitalizations for cirrhosis-related complications result in inpatient specialty care and the current hepatology workforce cannot meet the demand of patients with liver disease nationwide, particularly in less densely populated areas and in community-based practices not affiliated with academic centers.
NA,Telemedicine, defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means for diagnosis and treatment, holds tremendous promise to increase access to broadly specialty care.
NA,The technology is cheap and easy to use, however, is presently limited in scale by interstate licensing restrictions and reimbursement barriers.
NA,The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, in the short-term, accelerated the growth of telemedicine delivery as a public health and social distancing measure.
NA,Herein, we examine whether this public health crisis can accelerate the national conversation about broader adoption of telemedicine for routine medical care in non-crisis situations using a case series from our telehepatology program as a pragmatic example.
NA,With more than 900,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50,000 deaths during the first three months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis.
NA,The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases.
NA,For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment.
NA,While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances.
NA,Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints.
NA,To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints.
NA,Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.
NA,The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.
NA,Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide.
NA,Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments.
NA,Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19.
NA,RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed.
NA,We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.
NA,To evaluate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, and compare it with RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit.
NA,We optimized the RT-LAMP assay.
NA,And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation.
NA,The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (±SD) time was 18 ± 1.32 min and 20 ± 1.80 min, respectively, and 63°C was the optimum reaction temperature.
NA,The sensitivity was 2×10<sup>1</sup> copies and 2×10<sup>2</sup> copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively.
NA,This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens.

NA,The sensiticity was 100% (95% CI 92.3% - 100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7% - 100%).
NA,This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in the mean (±SD) time of 26.28 ± 4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation.
NA,These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples.
NA,It will be a powerful tool for SARS-CoV-2 identification, and for monitoring suspected patients, close contacts, and high-risk groups.
NA,The COVID-19 epidemic, which is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly to become a world-wide pandemic.
NA,Chest radiography and chest CT are frequently used to support the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
NA,However, multiple cases of COVID-19 transmission in radiology department have been reported.
NA,Here we summarize the lessons we learned and provide suggestions to improve the infection control and prevention practices of healthcare workers in departments of radiology.
NA,Amid concerns over the spread of COVID-19, oncology practices have &quot;gone virtual,&quot; with video appointments scheduled for any service that does not require diagnostic testing or treatment.
NA,Laboratories are currently witnessing extraordinary demand globally for sampling devices, reagents, consumables, and diagnostic instruments needed for timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce.
NA,We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received US FDA EUA on March 12, 2020.
NA,The comparator was a standardized 3-hour SARS-CoV-2 protocol, consisting of RNA extraction using an automated portable instrument, followed by a two-target RT-PCR, which our laboratory has routinely used since January 2020 (Corman VM et al.
NA,EuroSurveill 25 (3):2000045).
NA,Cobas and the comparator showed overall agreement of 98.1% and a kappa value of 0.95 on an in-house validation panel consisting of 217 well-characterized retrospective samples.
NA,Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation followed on 502 samples, and the diagnostic approaches showed overall percent agreement of 99.6% and a kappa value of 0.98.
NA,A good correlation (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.96) between cycle threshold values for SARS-CoV-2 specific targets obtained by cobas and the comparator was observed.
NA,Our results showed that cobas is a reliable assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the UTM-RT system.
NA,Under the extraordinary circumstances that laboratories are facing worldwide, a safe diagnostic platform switch is feasible in only 48 hours and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic if carefully planned and executed.
NA,Annually, around 850 liver transplantation is performed in Beijing, China.
NA,Recently, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has affected nearly 200 countries worldwide. 2019-nCov can cause severe lung disease, multiple-organ damage, and significant mortalities.
NA,Liver transplant recipients, because of long-term oral immunosuppressant effects, may be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection and have a worse prognosis than the general population.
NA,It is urgent to set up guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients.
NA,In this article, we reviewed the clinical aspects of 2019-nCoV infection, characteristics of liver transplant recipients, immunosuppressant usage, and potential drug interactions to provide recommendations to clinical staff managing liver transplant recipients during the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been demonstrated to be the cause of pneumonia.
NA,Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis.
NA,A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms.
NA,He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission.
NA,He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography.
NA,The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml.
NA,Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia.
NA,Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative.
NA,The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis.
NA,After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL.
NA,Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%.
NA,The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization.
NA,COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure.
NA,This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis.
NA,The mechanism of cardiac pathology caused by COVID-19 needs further study.
NA,Even though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening.
NA,This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place.
NA,For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly, and for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex.
NA,Yet also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.

NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated cancelation of elective or non-urgent contact with the healthcare system, including non-urgent nerve conduction studies and electromyography (electrodiagnostic [EDX] studies).
NA,The definitions of elective and non-urgent are physician judgments, and often are not straightforward.
NA,Clinical care must be provided to help our patients in a timely manner, while keeping them, health care personnel and the community safe.
NA,Benefit/risk stratification is an important part of this process.
NA,We have stratified EDX studies into 3 categories: Urgent, Non-urgent and Possibly Urgent, in an effort to help clinicians triage these referrals.
NA,For each category, we provide a rationale and some examples.
NA,However, each referral must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the clinical situation will evolve over time, necessitating flexibility in managing EDX triaging.
NA,Engaging the referring clinician and, at times, the patient, may be useful in the triage process.

NA,The possibility of mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is currently a highly debated concept in perinatal medicine.
NA,It has implications for the mother, fetus, and neonate, as well as for healthcare providers present at the time of birth and caring for the child during the neonatal period, including obstetricians, midwives, family doctors, anesthetists, pediatricians, neonatologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists.
NA,At present the evidence for intrauterine transmission from mother to fetus or intrapartum transmission from mother to the neonate is sparse.
NA,There are limitations associated with sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests used and classification of patients based on test results has also been questioned.
NA,To explore the significance of SAA in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
NA,A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected.
NA,The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied.
NA,All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020.
NA,COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range.
NA,As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans.
NA,Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging.
NA,SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
NA,Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency.
NA,An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported.
NA,Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea.
NA,We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.
NA,It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms.
NA,A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%.
NA,SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
NA,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia.
NA,ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.
NA,Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation.
NA,Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms.
NA,The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.
NA,The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase.
NA,When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment.
NA,Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care.
NA,Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response.
NA,Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed.
NA,We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.
NA,We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management.
NA,We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;pathogenesis&quot;, &quot;incubation period&quot;, &quot;transmission&quot;, &quot;clinical features&quot;, &quot;diagnosis&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, with interposition of the Boolean operator &quot;AND&quot;.
NA,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death.
NA,Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality.
NA,Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19.
NA,No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.
NA,Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects.
NA,Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.
NA,Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management.
NA,No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence.
NA,Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.
NA,Anesthesiologists have a high risk of infection with COVID-19 during perioperative care and as first responders to airway emergencies.
NA,The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk.
NA,The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross-contamination to other patients and staff.
NA,The authors have presented a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests.
NA,Patients can then be rapidly assigned into 1 of 3 risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques.
NA,Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources.
NA,Educating medical staff about the proper use of high-risk areas for containment serves to protect staff and patients.
NA,To evaluate the clinical and computed tomographic (CT) features in the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) amplification of the viral DNA from a sputum sample.
NA,Clinical information and CT findings of a total of 14 patients with COVID-19 infection (age range, 12-83 years; females 6) were analyzed retrospectively.
NA,The clinical information includes the history of exposure, laboratory results, and the symptoms (such as fever, cough, headache, etc.)
NA,; CT findings of chest include the extension and distribution of lesion, the ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchovascular enlarged, irregular linear appearances, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy.
NA,Eight patients had the exposure history for recent travel to Wuhan of Hubei province (8/14, 57%), 6 had the exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,Significant statistical differences were observed in lymphocyte percentage decreased and C-reactive protein elevated (p = 0.015).
NA,Seven patients had fever, 7 had cough, 2 had headache, 3 had fatigue, 1 had body soreness, 3 had diarrhea, and 2 had no obvious symptoms.
NA,In chest CT examination, 10 patients were positive (10/14, 71.43%).
NA,Among these patients, 9 had lesions involving both lungs (9/10, 90%), 8 had lesions involving 4 to 5 lobes (8/10, 80%).
NA,Most of lesions were distributed peripherally and the most significant lesions were observed in the right lower lobe in 9 patients (9/10, 90%).
NA,Nodules were observed in 5 patients (5/10, 50%); GGO, consolidation, and bronchovascular enlarged were shown in 9 patients (9/10, 90%); irregular linear appearances were revealed in 7 patients (7/10, 70%); and pleural effusions were exhibited in 2 patients (2/10, 20%).
NA,Last, no patients showed lymphadenopathy.
NA,There were some typical CT features for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,The radiologists should know these CT findings and clinical information, which could help for accurate analysis in the patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is raging in China and more than 20 other countries and regions since the middle of December 2019.
NA,Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine besides symptomatic supportive therapy.
NA,Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques(molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short).
NA,In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology.
NA,Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using &amp;quot;back-to-back&amp;quot; manner.
NA,Then, the formula was optimized and determined by comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups.
NA,The results showed that the research team screened out 46 active ingredients from candidate TCMs that could act on the novel coronavirus S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 protein, which were mainly attributed to 7 herbs such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Mori Folium.
NA,The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality.
NA,This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes.
NA,Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription &amp;quot;Keguan Yihao&amp;quot;, immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital.
NA,The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone.
NA,This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases.
NA,It is of great significance to further improve the rapid response mechanism of TCM in face of major epidemics, and further improve the capability level of TCM to prevent and treat new emerging infectious diseases.
NA,With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has been playing an active role against the epidemic.
NA,However, the screening of TCM is limited by the development cycle and laboratory conditions, which greatly limits the screening speed.
NA,This study established optimization docking models and virtual screening to discovery potential active herbs for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on molecular docking technology.
NA,The crystal structures of 3 CL protease(Mpro) and papain-like protease(PLP) were obtained from PDB database and homologous modeling respectively, and were used to conduct virtual screening of TCMD 2009 database by CDOCKER program.
NA,The ingredients scored in the top 100 were selected respectively, and the candidate herbs were ranked by the numbers of hit molecules.
NA,Based on Mpro inhibitors screening, 12 322 potential active components were obtained, and the representative active components included aster pentapeptide A, ligustrazine, salvianolic acid B, etc., and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Dianthi Herba, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Cistanches Herba were obtained.

NA,By combining the diagnosis and treatment scheme of Hunan province's and angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) inhibitors screening from literature, present study also discussed the rational application of candidate herbs to this epidemic situation.
NA,Trichosanthis Fructus obtained by PLP inhibitors screening and Fritillaria verticillata obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were parts of the Sangbei Zhisou Powder and Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, which might be applicable to the syndromes of cough and dyspnea.
NA,Rhei Radix et Rhizoma screened by Mpro and Trichosanthis Fructus screened by PLP were contained in Maxing Shigan Decoction and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, and could be applied to the syndromes of epidemic virus blocking lung.
NA,Mori Folium, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Forsythiae Fructus obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were included in the Sangju Decoction and Yinqiaosan, which might be applicable to the syndromes of warm pathogen attacking lung and cough and dyspnea.
NA,The results of this study are intended to provide a reference for the further development of traditional Chinese medicine to deal with the new epidemic.
NA,Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, the epidemic has developed rapidly and the situation is grim.
NA,LANCET figured out that the 2019-nCoV is closely related to &amp;quot;cytokine storm&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Cytokine storm&amp;quot; is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria.
NA,As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin(IL), interferon(IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine(CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction.
NA,With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death.
NA,Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation.
NA,Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the &amp;quot;cytokine storm&amp;quot;.
NA,Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009(TCMD 2009) was screened.
NA,The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value.
NA,In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on &amp;quot;cytokine storm&amp;quot; according to the potential herbs in the &amp;quot;National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan(trial version sixth)&amp;quot;.
NA,The results showed that the hit components with the inhibitory effect on AA were magnolignan Ⅰ, lonicerin and physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopy-ranoside, which mostly extracted from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Arctii Fructus, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paeoniaeradix Rubra, Dioscoreae Rhizoma.
NA,Finally the anti-2019-nCoV prescriptions were analyzed to obtain the potential active prescriptions on AA metabolic pathway, Huoxiang Zhengqi Capsules, Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Xuebijing Injection, Reduning Injection and Tanreqing Injection were found that may prevent 2019-nCoV via regulate cytokines.

NA,Loopholes were in large part due to our limited understanding of the highly contagious coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is characterized by features not observed in other SARS viruses.
NA,We recommend to set up an isolation zone for handling patients who do not meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 but are not completely cleared of the possibility of infection.
NA,Loopholes in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments are due to poor understanding of the emerging disease which can be fixed by establishing an isolation zone for patients not completely cleared of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,We have read with interest the review of Feng et al. &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): What we know?
NA,&quot; 1 which report the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

NA,COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic; early identification of severe illness is critical for controlling it and improving the prognosis of patients with limited medical resources.
NA,The present study aimed to analyze the characteristics of severe COVID-19 and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction.
NA,In total, 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 75 patients with flu were retrospectively enrolled.
NA,Clinical parameters were collected from electronic medical records.
NA,The disease course was divided into four stages: initial, progression, peak, and recovery stages, according to computed tomography (CT) progress.
NA,Compared to mild COVID-19, the lymphocytes in the severe COVID-19 progressively decreased at the progression and the peak stages, but rebound in the recovery stage.
NA,The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the severe group at the initial and progression stages were higher than those in the mild group.
NA,Correlation analysis showed that CRP (R=0.62, P&lt;0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R=0.55, P&lt;0.01) and granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio (R=0.49, P&lt;0.01) were positively associated with the CT severity scores.
NA,In contrast, the number of lymphocytes (R=-0.37, P&lt;0.01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.
NA,Receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID-19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10-1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut-off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.
NA,CRP in severe COVID-19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, prior to CT findings.
NA,Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID-19.

NA,Covid-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus presenting a variability of flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue; in severe cases, patients develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, that can result in their death.
NA,This infection, which was declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, is particularly dangerous for dialysis patients, as they are frail and more vulnerable to infections due to the overlap of multiple pathologies.
NA,In patients with full-blown symptoms, there is a renal impairment of various degrees in 100% of the subjects observed.
NA,However, as Covid-19 is an emerging disease, more work is needed to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies.
NA,It is essential to avoid nosocomial spread; in order to control and reduce the rate of infections it is necessary to strengthen the management of medical and nursing personnel through the early diagnosis, isolation and treatment of patients undergoing dialysis treatment.
NA,We cover here a series of recommendations for the treatment of dialysis patients who are negative to the virus, and of those who are suspected or confirmed positive.
NA,The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health in more than 200 countries.
NA,Reliable laboratory diagnosis of the disease has been one of the foremost priorities for promoting public health interventions.
NA,The routinely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the reference method for COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,However, it also reported a number of false-positive or -negative cases, especially in the early stages of the novel virus outbreak.
NA,In this work, a dual-functional plasmonic biosensor combining the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction provides an alternative and promising solution for the clinical COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,The two-dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) functionalized with complementary DNA receptors can perform a sensitive detection of the selected sequences from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through nucleic acid hybridization.
NA,For better sensing performance, the thermoplasmonic heat is generated on the same AuNIs chip when illuminated at their plasmonic resonance frequency.
NA,The localized PPT heat is capable to elevate the <i>in situ</i> hybridization temperature and facilitate the accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences.
NA,Our dual-functional LSPR biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a lower detection limit down to the concentration of 0.22 pM and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multigene mixture.
NA,This study gains insight into the thermoplasmonic enhancement and its applicability in the nucleic acid tests and viral disease diagnosis.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of academic medical center missions.
NA,The number and rapidity of innovative responses to the crisis are extraordinary.
NA,When the pandemic has subsided, the world of academic medicine will have changed.
NA,The author of this Invited Commentary anticipates that at least some of these innovations will become part of academic medicine's everyday clinical and educational operations.
NA,Here he considers the implications of exemplary innovations-virtual care, hospital at home, advances in diagnosis and therapy, virtual learning, and virtual clinical learning-for regulators, academic medical centers, faculty, and students.
NA,Some patients undergoing routine SPECT/CT and PET/CT examinations during the Covid-19 pandemic may incidentally reveal findings of Covid-19 associated pneumonia (C-19AP) on localizing CT.
NA,It is critical for Nuclear Medicine physicians to develop diagnostic skills for timely recognition of typical findings of C-19AP on a localizing CT.
NA,Furthermore, it is our responsibility to know the optimal practices for safely isolating and managing such patients while protecting the staff, other patients at the facility, family and/or friend accompanying the patients, and the public in general from risky exposure to Covid-19 sources.
NA,We offer several steps following an encounter suspicious of C-19AP.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a kind of viral pneumonia with an unusual outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been marked as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the twenty-first century.
NA,In this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss current knowledge of molecular immune pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 on the base of the present understanding of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Diagnostic testing to identify persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is central to control the global pandemic of COVID-19 that began in late 2019.
NA,In a few countries, the use of diagnostic testing on a massive scale has been a cornerstone of successful containment strategies.
NA,In contrast, the United States, hampered by limited testing capacity, has prioritized testing for specific groups of persons.
NA,Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assays performed in a laboratory on respiratory specimens are the reference standard for COVID-19 diagnostics.
NA,However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging.
NA,Although excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients in well-equipped laboratories, important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic persons in the incubation phase, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions to end isolation.
NA,Many affluent countries have encountered challenges in test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibited rapid increases in testing capacity.
NA,These challenges may be even greater in low-resource settings.
NA,Urgent clinical and public health needs currently drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Here, the authors review the current array of tests for SARS-CoV-2, highlight gaps in current diagnostic capacity, and propose potential solutions.
NA,The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has very high infectivity, which allows it to spread rapidly around the world.
NA,Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed.
NA,We propose that the olfactory epithelium from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate tissue for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the earliest stages, prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic people, as compared to commonly used sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Multiple non-neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation.
NA,This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Moreover, the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons.
NA,In addition, we discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease.
NA,We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects of SARS-CoV-2 actions in the nervous system, especially in the olfactory pathway.
NA,An outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other cities and nations.
NA,The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR.
NA,However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted.
NA,Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR.
NA,The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nucleic acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1-7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8-14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively.
NA,The ICG detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%.
NA,In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen's kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples.
NA,In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant barriers to timely donor evaluation, cell collection and graft transport for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT).
NA,To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserve grafts before the start of pretransplant conditioning.
NA,Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (ptCY), is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known.
NA,Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY.
NA,We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT from 2013-2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY.
NA,Eighteen received bone marrow and 256, peripheral blood grafts.
NA,These were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI) and propensity score to 1,080 patients that underwent allo-HCT with a fresh graft.
NA,The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh versus cryopreserved graft, was calculated logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT-comorbidity index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type and recipient race.
NA,The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).
NA,Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease GVHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS).
NA,Because of multiple comparisons, only p-values &lt;0.01 were considered statistically significant.
NA,The two cohorts (cryopreserved versus fresh) were similar in patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-comorbidity index, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity.
NA,One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval, 68.3-73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (64.6-75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (p=0.81).
NA,Corresponding probabilities of OS survival at two years were 60.6% (57.3-63.8%) and 58.7% (51.9-65.4%) (p=0.62).
NA,In matched pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio for cryopreserved versus fresh [HR] =1.05, 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.29, p=0.60).
NA,Similarly, rates neutrophil recovery (HR=0.91, 0.80-1.02, p=0.12), platelet recovery (HR=0.88, 0.78-1.00, p=0.05), grade 3-4 acute GVHD (HR=0.78, 0.50-1.22, p=0.27), NRM (HR=1.16, 0.86-1.55, p=0.32) and relapse/progression (HR=1.21, 0.97-1.50, p=0.09) were similar with cryopreserved versus fresh grafts.
NA,There were somewhat lower rates chronic GVHD (HR=0.78, 0.61-0.99, p=0.04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure=1.19, 95%CI=1.01-1.29, p=0.04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
NA,Graft cryopreservation does not significantly delay hematopoietic recovery, increase acute GVHD risk or NRM, or decrease overall survival after all-HCT using ptCY.
NA,Severe infection involving the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that subsequently requires patients to be intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation.
NA,In the setting of the recent pandemic, there is a greater need to perform tracheostomy for these patients.
NA,With the high transmissibility of the virus, there has been an increasing concern for the development of techniques to perform surgical intervention while mitigating the risk for infecting hospital staff.
NA,As more data emerge pertaining to viral shedding in various bodily fluids, it has become more important to give special attention to precautions.
NA,In this article, we submit a novel approach for better protection and thus reduced transmission for tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient.
NA,Importantly, this technique is functional, easy to set up, and can be used for additional operations that involve risk of aerosolization or droplet exposure to operating room staff.
NA,The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know.
NA,We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics.
NA,Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting.
NA,However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
NA,Since December 2019, the infection of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and caused great public concern.
NA,Both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belong to the coronavirus family and both invade target cells through ACE2.
NA,An in-depth understanding of ACE2 and a series of physiological and physiological changes caused by the virus invading the human body may help to discover and explain the corresponding clinical phenomena and then deal with them timely.
NA,In addition, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target.
NA,This article will summarize the role of ACE2 in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide the basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development.
NA,Among surgeons worldwide, a concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques has been raised due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) with the creation of pneumoperitoneum.
NA,Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed.
NA,We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic.
NA,Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic.
NA,There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission.
NA,Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.
NA,On December 31, 2019, the Chinese health authorities informed the international community, through the mechanisms established by the World Health Organization (WHO), of a pneumonia epidemic of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
NA,The first cases were reported early in that month and were linked to a history of having visited a market where food and live animals are sold.
NA,On January 7, 2020, isolation and identification of the culprit pathogen was achieved using next-generation sequencing, while the number of affected subjects continued to rise.
NA,The publication of full-genomes of the newly identified coronavirus (initially called 2019-nCoV, now called SARS-CoV2) in public and private databases, of standardized diagnostic protocols and of the clinical-epidemiological information generated will allow addressing the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), declared on January 30 by the WHO.
NA,With this document, we intend to contribute to the characterization of the pneumonia epidemic, now designated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) review the strengths Mexico has in the global health concert and invite health professionals to join the preparedness and response activities in the face of this emergency.
NA,El 31 de diciembre de 2019, las autoridades chinas de salud informaron a la comunidad internacional, a través de los mecanismos establecidos por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), de una epidemia de neumonía con etiología desconocida en Wuhan, provincia de Hubei.
NA,Los primeros casos se notificaron a inicios de ese mes y se vincularon al antecedente de visitar un mercado de comida y animales vivos.
NA,El 7 de enero de 2020 se logró el aislamiento y reconocimiento del patógeno responsable mediante secuenciación de siguiente generación, mientras el número de afectados continuaba en ascenso.
NA,La publicación de genomas completos del nuevo coronavirus identificado (inicialmente denominado 2019-nCoV, ahora designado SARS-CoV2) en bases de datos públicas y privadas, de protocolos diagnósticos estandarizados y de la información clínica epidemiológica generada permitirá atender la Emergencia de Salud Pública de Importancia Internacional (ESPII) declarada el 30 de enero por la OMS.
NA,Con este documento pretendemos aportar a la caracterización de la epidemia de neumonía, ahora llamada enfermedad por coronavirus (Covid-19), revisar las fortalezas que tiene México en el concierto de la salud global e invitar a los profesionales de la salud a incorporarse a las actividades de preparación y respuesta ante esta emergencia.
NA,In December 2019, an outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China.
NA,Since then, this disease has infected more than 900,000 individuals worldwide.
NA,Here we report a case of non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia who was living with HIV.
NA,Chest computed tomography (CT) showed different abnormalities from those of conventional COVID-19, and the faster absorption of pulmonary lesions also highlights the importance of antiretroviral therapy in this patient.
NA,This report provides reference for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected patients with COVID-19.

NA,Confirmative diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been challenged due to unsatisfactory positive rate of molecular assays.
NA,Here we identified a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with five of six family members were SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobin serology testing positive, while molecular assays only detected two of this five patients even repeated twice.
NA,We comprehensively analyzed this familial cluster of cases based on the clinical characteristics, chest CT images, SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection results, and serology testing results.
NA,At last, two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, two were suspected of COVID-19, and two were considered close contacts.
NA,Our results emphasized the significance of serology testing to assist timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially for COVID-19 close contacts screening.
NA,This is a review of diagnostic imaging findings in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,CT findings are frequently bilateral, multilobar and peripheral ground-glass opacities with vascular enlargements.
NA,Consolidations often appear during progression as well as crazy paving and reticulation.
NA,Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions and pneumothorax are rare and should raise concern for other disease.
NA,Initially the CT can be normal, and the diagnostic performance for COVID-19 is not optimal.
NA,However, findings of characteristic ground-glass opacities during the ongoing epidemic should lead to considerations, that the patient may have COVID-19.
NA,Background Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the cases of a significant proportion of patients are severe.
NA,A viral nucleic acid test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19.
NA,Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known.
NA,Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19.
NA,Methods A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.
NA,According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls.
NA,The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed.
NA,Results The positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01).
NA,The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19.
NA,Conclusions Some urine biochemical parameters are different between patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and healthy controls, and GLU-U and PRO may be helpful for the differentiation of COVID-19 severity.
NA,There are insufficient data regarding the safety of otologic procedures in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,Given the proclivity for respiratory pathogens to involve the middle ear and the significant aerosolization associated with many otologic procedures, safety precautions should follow current recommendations for procedures involving the upper airway.
NA,Until preoperative diagnostic testing becomes standardized and readily available, elective cases should be deferred and emergent/urgent cases should be treated as high risk for COVID-19 exposure.
NA,Necessary otologic procedures on positive, suspected, or unknown COVID-19 status patients should be performed using enhanced personal protective equipment, including an N95 respirator and eye protection or powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR, preferred), disposable cap, disposable gown, and gloves.
NA,Powered instrumentation should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and if performed, PAPR or sealed eye protection is recommended.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the global health care system.
NA,Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance.
NA,To illustrate how new medical informatics technologies will enable effective control of the pandemic, the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 was developed and successfully deployed within 72 hours in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China.
NA,The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices.
NA,HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients.
NA,The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies.
NA,The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources.
NA,However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation.
NA,The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies.
NA,The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated.
NA,This is a cross-sectional study of patients who received a COVID-19 diagnosis between December 30, 2019 and February 7, 2020 at Tongji Hospital.
NA,A total of 102 patients (48 Male [47%] and 54 Female [53%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years.
NA,Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) were confirmed to have COVID-19 by laboratory diagnosis with a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay.
NA,Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis were identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Of those two patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were found in ocular discharges by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in only one patient.
NA,Our findings suspect the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, while the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route.
NA,To lower the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infection, all health care professionals should wear protective goggles.The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,To summarize the administration model of a COVID-19 designated hospital transformed from a community hospital to improve the emergency capacity of community hospitals and the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of medical staff in the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital.
NA,From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period).
NA,Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe.
NA,There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection.
NA,We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19.
NA,Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully.
NA,After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals.
NA,Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.
NA,The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic.
NA,Due to growing demand for reagents and/or kits to extract SARS-CoV-2 RNA for subsequent RT-qPCR diagnostics, there is a worldwide risk of shortages.
NA,With a detection sensitivity of 97.4% (95% CI: 86.2-99.9%), we describe a simple, fast, alternative workflow for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, where samples are simply heat-processed for 5 min at 98 °C before a commonly-used RT-qPCR procedure.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread fast and extensively around the world, with significant mortality and morbidity.
NA,As this is a respiratory infection, chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) are important imaging techniques in the work-up of this disease.
NA,Given its highly infectious nature, cross-infection within the healthcare setting and radiology departments needs to be addressed actively and prevented.
NA,We describe the response of radiology departments in Singapore to this pandemic, in terms of diagnosis, re-configuration of the department, re-organisation and segregation of staff, infection control, managerial, and leadership issues.
NA,The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing.
NA,However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting.
NA,Computed tomography (CT) can be used as an important complement for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in the current epidemic context.
NA,In this review, we present the typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia and discuss the main differential diagnosis.
NA,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan has caused an outbreak and become a major public health issue in China and great concern from international community.
NA,Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19.
NA,We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes.
NA,Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis.
NA,112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study.
NA,There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis.
NA,Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died.
NA,Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death.
NA,15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension.

NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible acute respiratory disease that is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a beta coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
NA,COVID-19 has been spreading swiftly globally, and as of March 2020, has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,One of the challenges in managing COVID-19 is the identification of a swift, accessible, and reliable diagnostic modality that could serve as an alternative to a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,As of the writing of this paper, RT-PCR is still the recommended tool in diagnosing COVID-19, but the notion of a more prompt and accurate diagnostic tool is a possibility worth looking into.
NA,The objective of this case study is to investigate the importance and utility of chest computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19, as increasing pieces of evidence suggest that chest CT could prove useful in the clinical pathway in diagnosing COVID-19.
NA,A serious epidemic of COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread to other Chinese cities and several countries now.
NA,As the majority of patients infected with COVID-19 had chest CT abnormality, chest CT has become an important tool for early diagnosis of COVID-19 and monitoring disease progression.
NA,There is growing evidence that children are also susceptible to COVID-19 and have atypical presentations compared with adults.
NA,This review is mainly about the differences in clinical symptom spectrum, diagnosis of COVID-19, and CT imaging findings between adults and children, while highlighting the value of radiology in prevention and control of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.
NA,KEY POINTS: • Compared with adults, pediatric patients with COVID-19 have the characteristics of lower incidence, slighter clinical symptoms, shorter course of disease, and fewer severe cases.
NA,• The chest CT characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatric patients were atypical, with more localized GGO extent, lower GGO attenuation, and relatively rare interlobular septal thickening.
NA,• Chest CT should be used with more caution in pediatric patients with COVID-19 to protect this vulnerable population from risking radiation.

NA,The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reminds us of the SARS outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID-19.
NA,Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy.
NA,In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu Formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (nine males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study.
NA,All patients received oral HGF therapy for six months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH.
NA,They had been regularly followed up at an interval of one year.
NA,Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes.
NA,Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from six to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 pre-collapse hips (ARCO stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse(ARCO stage III or IV).
NA,Only five patients (also five hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis.
NA,We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score.
NA,The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis.
NA,Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty (THA)surgery, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH.
NA,HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.

NA,The initial clinical presentation of CoronaVirus Disease 2019 may be appendicular syndrome.
NA,An abdominal CT scan ruled out a diagnosis of appendicitis and a chest CT scan yielded a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,CT scan is required before considering emergency surgery for acute appendicitis.
NA,Evaluating whether an infectious disease has reached a turning point is important for planning additional intervention efforts.
NA,This study aimed to analyze the changing patterns and the tempo-geographic features of the COVID-19 epidemic, to provide further evidence for real-time responses.
NA,Daily data on COVID-2019 cases between 31st Dec. 2019 and 26th Feb. 2020 were collected and analyzed for Hubei and non-Hubei regions.
NA,Observed trends for new and cumulative cases were analyzed through joint-point regressions.
NA,Spatial analysis was applied to show the geographic distribution and changing pattern of the epidemic.
NA,By 26th Feb. 2020, 78,630 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in China.
NA,In Hubei, an increasing trend (slope=221) was observed for new cases between 24th Jan. and February 7th Feb. 2020, after which a decline commenced (slope=-868).
NA,However, as the diagnosis criteria changed, a sudden increase (slope=5530) was observed on 12th Feb., which sharply decreased afterward (slope=-4898).
NA,In non-Hubei regions, the number of new cases increased from 20th Jan. to 3rd Feb. and started to decline afterward (slope=-53).
NA,The spatial analysis identified Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Shanghai, Xinyang, Jining, and Beijing as the hotspots outside of Hubei province in China.
NA,The joint-point regression analysis indicated that the epidemic might have been under control in China, especially for regions outside of Hubei province.
NA,Further improvement in the response strategies based on these new patterns is needed.
NA,Public health preparedness for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging in the absence of setting-specific epidemiological data.
NA,Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, UK.
NA,We analyzed routine diagnostic data for &gt;70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017.
NA,Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63.
NA,Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported.
NA,With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs.
NA,These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.
NA,Almost the entire world, not only China, is currently experiencing the outbreak of a novel coronavirus that causes respiratory disease, severe pneumonia, and even death.
NA,The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and is currently still ongoing.
NA,This novel coronavirus is highly contagious and has resulted in a continuously increasing number of infections and deaths that have already surpassed the SARS-CoV outbreak that occurred in China between 2002 and 2003.
NA,It is now officially a pandemic, announced by WHO on the 11th of March.
NA,Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial.
NA,Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
NA,Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency.
NA,Key Points • In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health.
NA,• Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians.
NA,• Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.
NA,With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic disease has come true.
NA,Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019.
NA,As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded.
NA,Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
NA,Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus.
NA,Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%).
NA,Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection.
NA,At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
NA,Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
NA,Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
NA,Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed many areas of public health preparedness that are lacking, especially in lower- and middle-income countries.
NA,Digital interventions provide many opportunities for strengthening health systems and could be vital resources in the current public health emergency.
NA,We provide several use cases for infection control, home-based diagnosis and screening, empowerment through information, public health surveillance and epidemiology, and leveraging crowd-sourced data.
NA,A thoughtful, concerted effort-leveraging existing experience and robust enterprise-grade technologies-can have a substantive impact on the immediate and distal consequences of COVID-19.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (officially named Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, which is currently a worldwide pandemic, mainly causes the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
NA,At present, it mainly relies on Real-time RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid collected from the clinical specimens of patients as the standard for diagnosis, discontinuation of quarantine and discharge.<sup>1,2</sup> This article is protected by copyright.

NA,Italy and the rest of the world are experiencing an outbreak of a novel beta-coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,In this context, in Italy, we reorganized the National Health System and prioritized the clinical cancer care scenario, balancing risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission versus the magnitude of clinical benefit deriving from a specific therapeutic approach.
NA,As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center.
NA,Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment.
NA,We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub-and-spoke design.
NA,Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer.
NA,Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.
NA,Treatment strategies were discussed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board.
NA,Treatment decision making balanced risk and benefits of treatment in the context of the specific pandemic level, on a case-by-case basis.
NA,<b>Context.</b> Point-of-care testing (POCT), diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care, is <u> <i>inherently spatial</i> </u>, that is, performed at points of need, and also <u> <i>intrinsically temporal</i> </u>, because it produces fast actionable results.
NA,Outbreaks generate geospatial &quot;hotspots.&quot; <i>POC strategies</i> help control hotspots, detect spread, and speed treatment of highly infectious diseases. <b>Objectives.</b> To stop outbreaks, accelerate detection, facilitate emergency response for epidemics, mobilize public health practitioners, enhance community resilience, and improve crisis standards of care. <b>Data Sources.</b> PubMed, WWW, newsprint, others were searched until COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the US, a national emergency, and Europe, the epicenter.
NA,Coverage comprised interviews in Asia, email to/from Wuhan, papers, articles, chapters, documents, maps, flowcharts, schematics, and geospatial-associated concepts.
NA,EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated literature as abstracts, ULRs, and PDFs, recovering 136 hotspot articles.
NA,More than 500 geospatial science articles were assessed for relevance to point-of-care testing. <b>Conclusions</b> POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount.
NA,Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources.
NA,Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.
NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic.
NA,Studies in the radiology literature have suggested that CT might be sufficiently sensitive and specific in diagnosing COVID-19 when used in lieu of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test; however, this suggestion runs counter to current society guidelines.
NA,The purpose of this article is to critically review some of the most frequently cited studies on the use of CT for detecting COVID-19. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> To date, the radiology literature on COVID-19 has consisted of limited retrospective studies that do not substantiate the use of CT as a diagnostic test for COVID-19.
NA,Community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in the United States in February 2020.
NA,By mid-March, all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City (NYC), and four U.S. territories had reported cases of COVID-19.
NA,This report describes the geographic distribution of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths reported by each U.S. state, each territory and freely associated state,* DC, and NYC during February 12-April 7, 2020, and estimates cumulative incidence for each jurisdiction.
NA,In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7).
NA,As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States.
NA,Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC.
NA,On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases.
NA,Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC.
NA,Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.
NA,Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.
NA,This study analyzed salivary samples of COVID-19 patients and compared the results with their clinical and laboratory data.
NA,Salivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR.
NA,The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs.
NA,Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected.
NA,Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered.
NA,Twenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females.
NA,The mean age was 61.5 +/- 11.2 years.
NA,Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases.
NA,All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse association between LDH and Ct values.
NA,Two patients showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or respiratory swabs showed conversion.
NA,Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The role of saliva in COVID-19 diagnosis could not be limited to a qualitative detection of the virus, but it may also provide information about the clinical evolution of the disease.
NA,COVID-19 pneumonia has high mortality rates.
NA,The symptoms are undiagnostic, the results of viral nucleic acid detection method (PCR) can delay, so that chest computerized tomography is often key diagnostic test in patients with possible COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,In this review, we discussed the main radiological findings of this infection.
NA,Nobody can be fully prepared to a pandemic.
NA,Of course there are signs of it, the scientists can predict, alarming speeches can be made.
NA,But there are always alarmist people around, maybe that is why sometimes even the most serious warnings may be not considered by the authorities on time.
NA,The first patients may be lost without a proper diagnosis.
NA,When everybody realizes that there may be a big problem in the horizon, sometimes it is too late.
NA,That is why it is very important to monitor contagious diseases and follow the warnings and releases of national and international disease control centers and other related organizations.
NA,China celebrated Lunar New Year with more than 40 thousand families on the 18 of January 2020.
NA,Nobody seem to be expecting this emerging new viral pneumonia outbreak appeared in Wuhan, in the last days of 2019, will break the chains and turn out to be a pandemic!
NA,But maybe this time it was not too late.
NA,There were four important pandemics within the last century: Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, Asian Flu and Swine Flu.
NA,Each left different story behind.
NA,Millions of people had infected, hundreds, thousands of people died.
NA,This time, the Modern World had different tools to limit the SARS CoV2 outbreak.
NA,The national and international institutions of our globe were all communicating and taking precautions in a very fast manner than ever.
NA,However, this time, unexpectedly, the SARS-CoV-2 contagion was also faster.
NA,Besides the international organizations like WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, the roles of local authorities, health ministries, disease control centers, health protection agencies, research centers and universities are all very important in different operational levels to control and survive from the pandemic.
NA,This paper will review the immediate response of different national and international institutions and authorities to COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Mental health concerns of people impacted by the coronavirus pandemic have not been adequately addressed.
NA,The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,This 5-item scale, which was based on 775 adults with anxiety over the coronavirus, demonstrated solid reliability and validity.
NA,Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products.
NA,The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of ≥ 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity).
NA,These results support the CAS as an efficient and valid tool for clinical research and practice.
NA,2019-nCoV epidemic was firstly reported at late December of 2019 and has caused a global outbreak of COVID-19 now.
NA,Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive.
NA,Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2.
NA,Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice.
NA,So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time.
NA,Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination.
NA,This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.
NA,A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with human to human transmission and extreme human sickness has been as of late announced from the city of Wuhan in China.
NA,Our objectives were to mutation analysis between recently reported genomes at various times and locations and to characterize the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics programs.
NA,Information on the variation of viruses is of considerable medical and biological impacts on the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of infectious diseases.
NA,To understand the genomic structure and variations of the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The study analyzed 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available in GenBank, National MicrobiologyData Center (NMDC) and NGDC Genome Warehouse from December-2019 until 05 of April-2020.
NA,The genomic signature analysis demonstrates that a strong association between the time of sample collection, location of sample and accumulation of genetic diversity.
NA,We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C&gt;T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T&gt;C in ORF8 gene and 29095C&gt;T in the N gene.
NA,The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing healthcare systems worldwide to the brink of collapse.
NA,One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections.
NA,On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation.
NA,Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts.
NA,This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians.
NA,To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT.
NA,In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms &quot;telemedicine&quot; and &quot;COVID-19.&quot; Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners.
NA,The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically.
NA,Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively.
NA,Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis.
NA,Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation.
NA,Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine.
NA,Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.
NA,Since a novel coronavirus was discovered from a cluster of patients with emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China, it has spread rapidly through droplet and contact transmission.
NA,Recently, the novel coronavirus pneumonia which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been raised as a worldwide problem.
NA,Radiological examinations were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,It is reported that some radiologists and radiological technologists were infected when giving examinations to the patients with COVID-19.
NA,In order to reduce the infection risk of medical staff in radiology department, we summarized the experience on prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work for radiologists and radiological technologists.
NA,KEY POINTS: • The novel coronavirus spreads rapidly through droplet and contact transmission.
NA,• Radiologists and radiological technologists were possibly infected by patients.
NA,• Prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19 are important.
NA,Rapid and accurate diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical during the epidemic.
NA,We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone.
NA,A consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions.
NA,Patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts.
NA,The chi-square test, Student's t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups.
NA,Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression.
NA,Diagnostic efficacies of developed models were quantified by receiver operating characteristic curve.
NA,Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram.
NA,Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different.
NA,Besides ground-glass opacities (p = 0.032) and consolidation (p = 0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1-3 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.027).
NA,Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417).
NA,Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000).
NA,The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits.
NA,Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.
NA,A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,• Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.
NA,• A diagnostic model for COVID-19 was developed and validated using radiological semantic and clinical features, which had an area under the curve value of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) and 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world.
NA,We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment.
NA,Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study.
NA,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared.
NA,Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters.
NA,Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases.
NA,Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03).
NA,In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02).
NA,There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults.
NA,There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases.
NA,The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03).
NA,Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).
NA,The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
NA,The clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after solid organ transplant (SOT) remain unknown.
NA,We report our preliminary experience with 18 SOT (kidney [44.4%], liver [33.3%], and heart [22.2%]) recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 by March 23, 2020 at a tertiary-care center at Madrid.
NA,Median age at diagnosis was 71.0 ± 12.8 years, and the median interval since transplantation was 9.3 years.
NA,Fever (83.3%) and radiographic abnormalities in form of unilateral or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (72.2%) were the most common presentations.
NA,Lopinavir/ritonavir (usually associated with hydroxychloroquine) was used in 50.0% of patients and had to be prematurely discontinued in 2 of them.
NA,Other antiviral regimens included hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (27.8%) and interferon-β (16.7%).
NA,As of April 4, the case-fatality rate was 27.8% (5/18).
NA,After a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset, 30.8% (4/13) of survivors developed progressive respiratory failure, 7.7% (1/13) showed stable clinical condition or improvement, and 61.5% (8/13) had been discharged home.
NA,C-reactive protein levels at various points were significantly higher among recipients who experienced unfavorable outcome.
NA,In conclusion, this frontline report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a severe course in SOT recipients.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic with a mortality rate of 1%-6% in the general population.
NA,However, the mortality rate seems to be significantly higher in elderly patients, especially those hospitalized with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery diseases.
NA,Because viral diseases may have atypical presentations in immunosuppressed patients, the course of the disease in the transplant patient population is unknown.
NA,Hence, the management of these patients with COVID-19 is an area of interest, and a unique approach is warranted.
NA,Here, we report the clinical features and our treatment approach for a kidney transplant patient with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,We believe that screening protocols for SARS-Cov-2 should be re-evaluated in patients with solid-organ transplants.
NA,While counting cases of disease appears straightforward, there are issues to consider when enumerating disease counts during an epidemic.
NA,For example, for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), how is a case defined?
NA,Hubei province in China changed its case definition twice in a fortnight-from laboratory-confirmed cases to clinically-confirmed cases without laboratory tests, and back to laboratory-confirmed cases.
NA,This caused confusion in the reported number of cases.
NA,If a confirmed case requires laboratory testing, what is the population who are laboratory-tested?
NA,Due to limited laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of an emerging epidemic, only &quot;suspected cases&quot; are laboratory-tested in most countries.
NA,This will result in underdiagnosis of confirmed cases and also raises the question: how is a &quot;suspect case&quot; defined?
NA,With the passage of time and increased capability to perform laboratory tests, more people can be screened and the number of confirmed cases will increase.
NA,What are the technical considerations of laboratory testing?
NA,This includes specimen collection (variable collection methods), samples collected (upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory test methods and kits (not all of which may be standardised or approved by authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration).
NA,Are approved laboratory facilities and trained manpower available, and how are test results interpreted and false-negatives excluded?
NA,These issues will affect the accuracy of disease counts, which in turn will have implications on how we mount an appropriate response to the outbreak.
NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> This series of patients presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain, without the respiratory symptoms typical of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the abdominal radiologist was the first to suggest COVID-19 infection because of findings in the lung bases on CT of the abdomen. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> COVID-19 infection can present primarily with abdominal symptoms, and the abdominal radiologist must suggest the diagnosis when evaluating the lung bases for typical findings.
NA,Background Recent studies have suggested that chest computed tomography (CT) scans could be used as a primary screening or diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in epidemic areas.
NA,Purpose To perform a meta-analysis to evaluate diagnostic performance measures, including predictive values, of chest CT and initial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,Materials and Methods MEDLINE and Embase were searched from January 1, 2020 to April 3, 2020 for studies on COVID-19 that reported the sensitivity and/or specificity of CT scans and/or RT-PCR assays.
NA,The pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated by using random-effects models.
NA,The actual prevalence (i.e., the proportion of confirmed patients among those tested) in eight countries was obtained from web sources, and the predictive values were calculated.
NA,Meta-regression was performed to reveal the effect of potential explanatory factors on the diagnostic performance measures.
NA,Results The pooled sensitivity was 94% (95% CI: 91%, 96%; <i>I</i><sup> <i>2</i> </sup>=95%) for chest CT and 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%; <i>I</i><sup> <i>2</i> </sup>=90%) for RT-PCR.
NA,The pooled specificity was 37% (95% CI: 26%, 50%; <i>I</i><sup> <i>2</i> </sup>=83%) for chest CT.
NA,The prevalence of COVID-19 outside China ranged from 1.0% to 22.9%.
NA,For chest CT scans, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 1.5% to 30.7%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) ranged from 95.4% to 99.8%.
NA,For RT-PCR,the PPV ranged from 47.3% to 96.4%, while the NPV ranged from 96.8% to 99.9%.
NA,The sensitivity of CT was affected by the distribution of disease severity, the proportion of patients with comorbidities, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).
NA,The sensitivity of RT-PCR was negatively associated with the proportion of elderly patients (<i>p</i> = 0.01).
NA,Conclusion Outside of China where there is a low-prevalence of COVID-19 (1-22.9%), chest CT screening of patients with suspected disease had low positive predictive value (1.5-30.7%).
NA,Background Computed tomography (CT) of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease depicts the extent of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Purpose The aim of the study was to determine the value of quantification of the well-aerated lung obtained at baseline chest CT for determining prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Materials and Methods Patients who underwent chest CT suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia at the emergency department admission between February 17 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
NA,Patients with negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasal-pharyngeal swabs, negative chest CT, and incomplete clinical data were excluded.
NA,CT was analyzed for quantification of well aerated lung visually (%V-WAL) and by open-source software (%S-WAL and absolute volume, VOL-WAL).
NA,Clinical parameters included demographics, comorbidities, symptoms and symptom duration, oxygen saturation and laboratory values.
NA,Logistic regression was used to evaluate relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (ICU admission/death vs. no ICU admission/ death).
NA,The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine model performance.
NA,Results The study included 236 patients (females 59/123, 25%; median age, 68 years).
NA,A %V-WAL&lt;73% (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.7-10.8; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), %S-WAL&lt;71% (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.9-7.5; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and VOL-WAL&lt;2.9 L (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.8; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01) were predictors of ICU admission/death.
NA,In comparison with clinical model containing only clinical parameters (AUC, 0.83), all three quantitative models showed higher diagnostic performance (AUC 0.86 for all models).
NA,The models containing %V-WAL&lt;73% and VOL-WAL&lt;2.9L were superior in terms of performance as compared to the models containing only clinical parameters (<i>P</i>=0.04 for both models).
NA,Conclusion In patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, visual or software quantification the extent of CT lung abnormality were predictors of ICU admission or death.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology.
NA,While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation.
NA,Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients.
NA,The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients.
NA,This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services.
NA,Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures.
NA,The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations.
NA,In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues.
NA,The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff.
NA,In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.
NA,Objectives In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China.
NA,Laboratory-based diagnostic tests utilized real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat samples.
NA,This study evaluated the diagnostic value to analyzing throat and sputum samples in order to improve accuracy and detection efficiency.
NA,Methods Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by the RT-PCR assay.
NA,Results The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively.
NA,Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using the RT-PCR assay (p = 0.001).
NA,Conclusions The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs.
NA,We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.
NA,The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.
NA,Background Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19, represents an emerging health threat worldwide as, after initial reports in China, it has continued to spread rapidly.
NA,The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from mild to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,Moreover, many patients can be asymptomatic, thus increasing the uncertainty of the diagnostic work-up.
NA,Laboratory tests play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the current gold standard being real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens.
NA,However, the diagnostic accuracy of rRT-PCR depends on many pre-analytical and analytical variables.
NA,The measurement of specific COVID-19 antibodies (both IgG and IgM) should serve as an additional, non-invasive tool for disease detection and management.
NA,Methods The imprecision of the MAGLUMI™ 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM and IgG assays (Snibe, Shenzhen, China) was assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A3 protocol.
NA,Linearity of dilution and recovery was evaluated by means of mixes of high-level pools and low-level pools of serum samples.
NA,Immunoglobulin time kinetics were evaluated using a series of serum samples, repeatedly collected from COVID-19-positive patients at different times, from &lt;5 days up to 26-30 days.
NA,Results Findings at the analytical validation of the assay carried out according to the CLSI EP15-A3 guideline demonstrated that imprecision and repeatability were acceptable (repeatability was &lt;4% and &lt;6% for IgM and IgG, respectively, whilst intermediate imprecision was &lt;6%).
NA,In addition, results of dilution and recovery studies were satisfactory.
NA,The kinetics of COVID-19 antibodies confirmed previously reported findings, showing a rapid increase of both IgM and IgG after 6-7 days from the symptom onset.
NA,IgG had 100% sensitivity on day 12, whilst 88% was the higher positive rate achieved for IgM after the same time interval.
NA,Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate the validity of the MAGLUMI 2000 Plus CLIA assay for the measurement of specific IgM and IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients, and for obtaining valuable data on the kinetics of both (IgM and IgG) COVID-19 antibodies.
NA,These data represent a pre-requisite for the appropriate utilization of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat.
NA,However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease.
NA,In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity.
NA,We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms.
NA,We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected ≥24 hours apart.
NA,We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms.
NA,There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone.
NA,Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course.
NA,The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 ± 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 ± 2.2 bowel movements per day.
NA,Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom.
NA,Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P &lt; 0.001).
NA,Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms.
NA,We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms.
NA,These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.
NA,Although the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens has been widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.
NA,However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.
NA,This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.
NA,The patients were divided into three groups according to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)&quot; issued by the National Health Commission of China.
NA,The clinical and laboratory data were collected.
NA,The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. .
NA,Clinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.
NA,Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.
NA,More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).
NA,Detectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.
NA,Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.
NA,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns.
NA,With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention.
NA,Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission.
NA,The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance.
NA,During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.
NA,For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.
NA,As of April 5, 2020, the World Health Organization reported over one million confirmed cases and more than 62,000 confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths affecting 204 countries/regions.
NA,The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum METHODS: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals.
NA,The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019.
NA,A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with α&lt; 0.05 (95% confidence interval).
NA,All six of the questions - 1) &quot;I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;&quot; 2) &quot;I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;&quot; 3) &quot;I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;&quot; 4)&quot;I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;&quot; 5) &quot;I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;&quot; and 6) &quot;I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles&quot; - showed statistical significant change pre and post training.
NA,Additionally, the final two questions - &quot;I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;&quot; and &quot;This training was valuable&quot; - received high scores on the Likert scale.
NA,This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics.
NA,This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.
NA,As clinicians and support personnel struggle with their responsibilities to treat during the current COVID-19 pandemic, several ethical issues have emerged.
NA,Will healthcare workers and support staff fulfill their duty to treat in the face of high risks?
NA,Will institutional and government leaders at all levels do the right things to help alleviate healthcare workers risks and fears?
NA,Will physicians be willing to make hard, resource-allocation decisions if they cannot first husband or improvise alternatives?
NA,With our healthcare facilities and governments unprepared for this inevitable disaster, front-line doctors, advanced providers, nurses, EMS, and support personnel struggle with acute shortages of equipment-both to treat patients and protect themselves.
NA,With their personal and possibly their family's lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety.
NA,This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks-including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive.
NA,Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services.
NA,Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers' risk perceptions with reality.
NA,They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques).
NA,Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions.
NA,Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input.
NA,Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal.
NA,We present a putative link between maternal COVID-19 infection in the peripartum period and rapid maternal deterioration with early organ dysfunction and coagulopathy.
NA,The current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 has already resulted in high numbers of critically ill patients and deaths in the non-pregnant population, mainly due to respiratory failure.
NA,During viral outbreaks, pregnancy poses a uniquely increased risk to women due to changes to immune function, alongside physiological adaptive alterations, such as increased oxygen consumption and edema of the respiratory tract.
NA,The laboratory derangements may be reminiscent of HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, and thus knowledge of the COVID-19 relationship is paramount for appropriate diagnosis and management.
NA,In addition to routine measurements of D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients presenting with COVID-19 as per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidance, monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen levels should be considered in pregnancy, as highlighted in this report.
NA,These investigations in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID-19 infection, and may warrant pre-emptive admission and consideration of delivery to achieve maternal stabilization.
NA,Several research lines are currently ongoing to address the multitude of facets of the pandemic COVID-19.
NA,In line with the One-Health concept, extending the target of the studies to the animals which humans are continuously interacting with may favor a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenetic mechanisms; thus, helping to adopt the most suitable containment measures.
NA,The last two decades have already faced severe manifestations of the coronavirus infection in both humans and animals, thus, circulating epitopes from previous outbreaks might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,In the present study, we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes and compare them with the homologues of taxonomically-related coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world.
NA,Protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated proteins.
NA,Moreover, structural epitope mapping by homology modelling revealed a potential immunogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins.
NA,These evidence provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.
NA,Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts.
NA,Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction.
NA,The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation.
NA,Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus.
NA,There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this.
NA,If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care.
NA,Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo.
NA,Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection.
NA,Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection.
NA,Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.
NA,As the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) progresses, many physicians in a wide variety of specialties continue to play pivotal roles in diagnosis and management.
NA,In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al.
NA,[1]; Chung et al.
NA,[2]).
NA,However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities.
NA,In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]).
NA,Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT.
NA,Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing.
NA,The purpose of this pictorial review article is to describe the most common manifestations and patterns of lung abnormality on CXR in COVID-19 in order to equip the medical community in its efforts to combat this pandemic.
NA,COVID-19, the latest outbreak of infectious disease, has caused huge medical challenges to China and the entire globe.
NA,No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated.
NA,The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests.
NA,However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early.
NA,The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19.
NA,In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed.
NA,The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied.
NA,In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied.
NA,The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was -1.52.
NA,With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6-24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2-43.0.
NA,The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.
NA,Dozens of <i>in vitro</i> diagnostics (IVDs) have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S.
NA,Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, but little has been studied to determine how well these assays perform using clinical specimens.
NA,….
NA,A new coronavirus, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged from China in late 2019 and has now caused a worldwide pandemic.
NA,The impact of COVID-19 has not been described so far in a military setting.
NA,We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges.
NA,Retrospective review of COVID-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland.
NA,Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers' instructions.
NA,The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission.
NA,He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation.
NA,He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours.
NA,Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2 days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company.
NA,Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them.
NA,Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours.
NA,Serological testing revealed positive for both patients.
NA,All others showed negative IgM and IgG.
NA,Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of COVID-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers.
NA,This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission.
NA,An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019.
NA,The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020.
NA,By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate.
NA,This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia.
NA,In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death.
NA,According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
NA,Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults.
NA,Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease.
NA,However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe.
NA,Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases.
NA,The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published.
NA,This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.
NA,Our first COVID-19 case in Turkey was a 44-year-old male who referred to the hospital on March 9, 2020.
NA,The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020.
NA,Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected.
NA,The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006.
NA,The Pandemic Influenza National Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic.
NA,Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels.
NA,This was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
NA,We formed teams to work on a 24/7 basis and established a Scientific Committee at the Public Health Emergency Operation Center within the General Directorate of Public Health.
NA,“COVID-19 Risk Assessment”, “COVID-19 Guideline” and “Case Report Form”, regulations of personal protective equipment along with need-based guidelines, treatment algorithms, brochures and related documents have been released.
NA,For the case-based follow-up, Public Health Management System (HSYS) is being used.
NA,PCR and rapid diagnostic kits are being used to analyze the samples at the central Microbiology Reference Laboratory and the authorized laboratories in several provinces.
NA,Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk.
NA,Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended.
NA,The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented.
NA,In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole.
NA,Health services across the world face an unprecedented situation as a result of a global COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Urgent joined research efforts regarding the SARS-COV-2 rapid tests, accurate diagnosis, especially early recognition, and effective treatment of life-threatening complications would be highly desirable for humanity and medical workforce all over the world that try to combat a current global pandemic threat.
NA,Due to indirect complex effect, intensified COVID-19 therapies and multi-drug treatment, it is believed that some oral conditions could be aggravated by COVID-19 disease, particularly those with autoimmune aetiology, linked to compromised immune system or long-term pharmacotherapy.
NA,Health literacy is the process of obtaining knowledge, motivation and individual competencies to understand and access information, express opinions and make decisions with respect to health promotion and maintenance.
NA,This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life.
NA,This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency.
NA,This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view.
NA,This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control.
NA,Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence.
NA,This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents.
NA,All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.
NA,Therefore, public health literacy is needed.
NA,La alfabetización en salud es el proceso centrado en la obtención del conocimiento, la motivación y las competencias individuales para entender y acceder a información, expresar opiniones y tomar decisiones relacionadas con la promoción y el mantenimiento de la salud, lo que es aplicable en diferentes contextos, entornos y a lo largo de toda la vida.
NA,Esta perspectiva conceptual es muy necesaria ante la emergencia del virus SARS-CoV-2 que produce la enfermedad Covid-19, la cual ha producido una pandemia con efectos devastadores, no sólo desde el punto de vista de la salud, sino también, de manera muy importante, desde el económico, político y social.
NA,En este ensayo se tratan de establecer los elementos basados en la evidencia científica que orientan las políticas públicas de prevención y control, entre los que destacan: a) la inteligencia epidemiológica, la cual incluye no sólo la estrategia de vigilancia poblacional sino, ante la imposibilidad real de identificación de todos los casos positivos, la puesta en práctica de estrategias de vigilancia centinela y la vigilancia basada en eventos; b) las medidas de mitigación de la propagación de la epidemia, tales como distanciamiento social e higiene, lavado de manos, cuarentena, restricción de movimiento y utilización de cubrebocas, entre otras; c) medidas de supresión de la transmisión cuando el número de casos es muy elevado, como el endurecimiento de medidas drásticas de encierro en casa; d) fortalecimiento de la capacidad de atención médica en los sistemas de salud e incremento de la capacidad de prevención de la transmisión en los servicios de salud, incluyendo la utilidad de las pruebas diagnósticas; y e) el desarrollo de vacunas profilácticas contra Covid-19, así como la generación de agentes terapéuticos.
NA,Todas estas acciones no sólo deben implementarse rápidamente desde la perspectiva multidisciplinaria y multisectorial de la salud pública para contener, prevenir y controlar la epidemia, sino que necesitan obligatoriamente del concurso de la comunidad como responsabilidad compartida.
NA,Debido a todo esto, es necesaria la alfabetización en salud pública.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months.
NA,Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department.
NA,A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19.
NA,Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection.
NA,The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training.
NA,Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission.
NA,The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues.
NA,Since December 2019, a new outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and rapidly spread throughout China, however, confirmed cases are still increasing worldwide.
NA,To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China.
NA,Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing.
NA,Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China).
NA,Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles.
NA,The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2-14 days.
NA,Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue.
NA,Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type.
NA,Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images.
NA,Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases.
NA,CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively.
NA,Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load.
NA,Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide.
NA,Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general.
NA,ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease.
NA,Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity.
NA,Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations.
NA,The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.
NA,Zimbabwe is among the countries that have been identified to be at risk of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,As of the 15<sup>th</sup> of March 2020, there was no confirmed case of the virus.
NA,Official reports of suspected cases were used to appraise the general screening, case management, and the emergency preparedness and response of the country towards the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In terms of the surveillance and capacity to screen at the ports of entry, the country seems to be faring well.
NA,The country might not be screening optimally, considering the number of COVID-19 tests conducted to date and the suspected cases who missed testing.
NA,Three of the suspected cases faced mental, social, and psychological consequences due to them being suspected cases of COVID-19.
NA,There is a need to enhance the screening process and infrastructure at all the ports of entry.
NA,More COVID-19 diagnostic tests should be procured to increase the testing capacity.
NA,Training and awareness on mental, social, and psychological consequences of COVID-19 should be offered to the health care workers and the general public.
NA,More financial resources should be sourced to enable the country control the pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 is a pandemic influencing the first half of the year 2020.
NA,The virus has rapidly spread to many countries.
NA,Studies are rapidly published to share information regarding epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic patterns, and prognosis.
NA,The following review condenses the surge of information into an organized format.
NA,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world.
NA,Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists.
NA,We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19.
NA,For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians.
NA,Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification.
NA,Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis.
NA,In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.
NA,We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.
NA,To analyze how governments, hospitals and information technology(IT) companies use Internet technology to provide online health services during the early stage of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in January 2020 in China, and then provide suggestions and coping strategies for the later stage and post-epidemic time.
NA,We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in China.
NA,The sources of information were mainstream search engines such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat.
NA,The keywords were &quot;Internet+pneumonia&quot;, &quot;Internet clinic&quot;, &quot;pneumonia online clinic&quot; and so on.
NA,The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020.
NA,The key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back.
NA,The coding information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on.
NA,The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel.
NA,There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals and IT companies.
NA,Most of them were launched from January 24th to 27th, the hospital and government projects services regionally, especially in eastern provinces.
NA,In this study, 90.48% of the enterprises and 100.00% of the hospitals had online fever clinic and consultation services for COVID-19, 66.67% of the enterprises and 37.04% of the hospitals serviced derivative health problems.
NA,Only a few projects provided tele-medical consultation.
NA,There were individual projects that provided online health management for home quarantine people.
NA,Physicians were the main force of various projects.
NA,In some hospital projects, there were also nurses, pharmacists and professional technicians to provide featured consultation.
NA,Ehealth is useful and helpful for the health care system to rapidly cope with health demand during instantaneous and post epidemic time.
NA,Regional distribution of ehealth is unbalanced.
NA,There are institutional and technical feasibilities for the emergency application of Internet technology.
NA,However, community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary hospitals with Internet.
NA,Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare system should promote emergence ehealth.
NA,Tele-medical diagnosis and referral should be developed by local governments during COVID-19.
NA,The application of &quot;Internet+medical treatment&quot; in community medical institutions and synergy among various institutions should be promoted.
NA,The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly spreading nationwide and abroad.
NA,A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed.
NA,The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset.
NA,The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
NA,The serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and consistency rate.
NA,The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the 4th day after symptom onset.
NA,In the confirmed patients with COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, and those of IgG were 83.3.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9 %.
NA,In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%.
NA,Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis for COVID-19 rely on great specificity.
NA,The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and later stage of the illness.
NA,Antibody detection may play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as complement approach for viral nucleid acid assays.
NA,Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment.
NA,The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice.
NA,The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; in conjunction with &quot;otorhinolaryngological manifestation&quot;, &quot;ENT&quot;, and &quot;olfaction&quot;.
NA,The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea.
NA,Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present.
NA,COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia.
NA,Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially.
NA,They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT.
NA,ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19.
NA,During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases.
NA,An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.
NA,Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed.
NA,Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
NA,Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.
NA,Pre-clinical responses to fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks heavily depend on choosing the best isolates for animal models that inform diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.
NA,Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters.
NA,Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation.
NA,We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatic approach.
NA,Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate.
NA,This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models.
NA,Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019 and the epidemic so rapidly happened within the whole country and abroad, raising serious problems and urgent concerns, such as: how to control most effectively human-to-human transmission?
NA,When does infection rate rise to its peak?
NA,What will eventually be the number of infected patients?
NA,How to make early diagnosis?
NA,What effective antiviral drugs are available?
NA,How to use the existing drugs to achieve the best effect?
NA,Can available drugs effectively improve the survival rate of critical patients?
NA,In view of the above questions, this article now puts forwards the corresponding suggestions and considerations from the perspective of clinical infectious diseases physician.
NA,2019年12月湖北武汉市暴发2019新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情，并迅速发生在国内其他地区以及境外，形势岌岌可危。
NA,新发的COVID-19疫情严重且紧迫，给我们带来大量亟待解决的问题，例如：如何最有效地控制人群传播？
NA,感染人数在什么时间达到最高峰？
NA,最高峰是多少？
NA,如何做到早期诊断？
NA,有哪些新的有效抗病毒药物？
NA,如何使用现有药物达到最佳疗效？
NA,是否能有效提高危重患者救治生存率？
NA,针对以上疑问，现从感染科临床医师的角度提出相应的建议和思考。.
NA,In the past two decades, the world has faced several infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,Ebola, Influenza A (H1N1), SARS, MERS, and Zika virus have had a massive global impact in terms of economic disruption, the strain on local and global public health.
NA,Most recently, the global outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is a newly discovered virus from the coronavirus family in Wuhan city, China, known to be a great threat to the public health systems.
NA,As of 15 April 2020, The Johns Hopkins University estimated that the COVID-19 affected more than two million people, resulting in a death toll above 130,000 around the world.
NA,Infected people in Europe and America correspond about 40% and 30% of the total reported cases respectively.
NA,At this moment only few Asian countries have controlled the disease, but a second wave of new infections is expected.
NA,Predicting inhibitor and target to the COVID-19 is an urgent need to protect human from the disease.
NA,Therefore, a protocol to identify anti-COVID-19 candidate based on computer-aided drug design is urgently needed.
NA,Thousands of compounds including approved drugs and drugs in the clinical trial are available in the literature.
NA,In practice, experimental techniques can measure the time and space average properties but they cannot be captured the structural variation of the COVID-19 during the interaction of inhibitor.
NA,Computer simulation is particularly suitable to complement experiments to elucidate conformational changes at the molecular level which are related to inhibition process of the COVID-19.
NA,Therefore, <i>computational simulation</i> is essential tool to elucidate the phenomenon.
NA,The structure-based virtual screening computational approach will be used to filter the best drugs from the literature, the investigate the structural variation of COVID-19 with the interaction of the best inhibitor is a fundamental step to design new drugs and vaccines which can combat the coronavirus.
NA,This mini-review will address novel coronavirus structure, mechanism of action, and trial test of antiviral drugs in the lab and patients with COVID-19.
NA,The previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have led researchers to study the role of diagnostics in impediment of further spread and transmission.
NA,With the recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control.
NA,Hence, we have developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a detection limit of 10<sup>2</sup> RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR<u>.</u> Notably, the assay has exhibited a rapid detection span of 30 min combined with the colorimetric visualization.
NA,This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV).
NA,Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR.
NA,Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.
NA,In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.
NA,Effective strategy to mitigate the ongoing pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) require a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the emerging virus causing COVID-19.
NA,The dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral antigen specific antibody responses among COVID-19 patients started to be reported but there is no consensus on their patterns.
NA,Here, we conducted a serial investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centres from Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical symptoms.
NA,The longitudinal swab samples and sera were collected from these people for viral RNA testing and antibody responses, respectively.
NA,Our data revealed different pattern of seroconversion among these groups.
NA,All 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 5 severe COVID-19 patients were seroconverted during hospitalization or follow-up period, suggesting that serological testing is a complementary assay to nucleic acid test for those symptomatic COVID-19 patients.
NA,Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases.
NA,On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period.
NA,Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design.
NA,Since December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan led to an outbreak throughout China and the rest of the world.
NA,To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%.
NA,Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19.
NA,Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.
NA,This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention.
NA,The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.
NA,The diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with cerebral involvement is challenging given the rarity of HLH and its resemblance to the much more common severe sepsis.
NA,Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving.
NA,We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation.
NA,Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare.
NA,HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction.
NA,Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19.
NA,BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1].
NA,Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).
NA,Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in HLH patients (Valade et al., 2015).
NA,OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HLH with neurological involvement to prevent serious complications and demise.
NA,COVID-19 pneumonia presented with certain characteristic chest CT imaging features, which are helpful to the radiologist in the early detection and diagnosis of this emerging global health emergency.
NA,In this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19.
NA,Except for one case with normal lung appearance, all the other four cases had certain characteristics, including ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and atoll sign.
NA,The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral portion of lung.
NA,Current studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare.
NA,The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown.
NA,Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children.
NA,We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series.
NA,Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed.
NA,A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis.
NA,Nine case series were included.
NA,In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history.
NA,The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%).
NA,Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care.
NA,Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%.
NA,Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon.
NA,There are 26% children are asymptomatic.
NA,The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%).
NA,Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19.
NA,Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease.
NA,COVID-19 has distinct features in children.
NA,The disease severity is mild.
NA,Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing.
NA,COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
NA,Since its detection in China at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency.
NA,The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms.
NA,Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.
NA,Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome.
NA,In line with the current opinion of the WHO, we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of COVID-19 are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks.
NA,We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission.
NA,The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide.Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies.Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.
NA,We describe two elderly patients evaluated at emergency departments for anosmia/dysgeusia in the absence of any other respiratory symptoms prior to or upon admission.
NA,In the current epidemiological context, clinical and biological work-up led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
NA,Unfortunately, one of the patients died during hospitalization, but the other recovered and was discharged.
NA,In the current epidemiological situation, anosmia and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory conditions should be carefully evaluated.Special attention should be given to patients with non-classic COVID-19 symptoms in order to reduce transmission and protect health providers.
NA,A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in China was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,We report the screening and diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital.
NA,Developed a procedure for the identification of children cases with COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency department of our hospital, then we observed how this process works.
NA,(I) There were 56 cases considered suspected cases, and 10 cases were confirmed as COVID-19.
NA,(II) Of the 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in our hospital, 5 were males and 5 were females, aged from 7 months to 11 years, the average age is 6.0±4.2 years, 6 cases were mild pneumonia, the others were upper respiratory tract infection.
NA,(III) We followed up 68 patients in isolation at home until symptoms disappeared.
NA,Non were missed in the patient's first visit.
NA,The sensitivity of this method is 100% and the specificity is 71.3%.
NA,Our screening process works well, and it is also necessary to establish a screening network in the hospital.
NA,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses.
NA,Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43.
NA,However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans.
NA,The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic.
NA,In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death.
NA,SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates.
NA,Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.
NA,However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain.
NA,Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults.
NA,Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs.
NA,Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.
NA,The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
NA,In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.
NA,In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
NA,Research on the use of video-mediated technology for medical consultations is increasing rapidly.
NA,Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions.
NA,The few studies that have focused on physical examinations in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants.
NA,The specific activity of wound assessment through video in postsurgery consultations has not yet been studied.
NA,Furthermore, a comparative analysis of face-to-face and video settings on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original.
NA,The aim of this study was to examine the impact of video technology on the procedure of postsurgery wound assessment and its limits.
NA,We recorded 22 postoperative video consultations and 17 postoperative face-to-face consultations.
NA,The primary purpose of the consultation was to inform the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen, and the secondary purpose was to check on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound.
NA,The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of conversation analysis.
NA,The way that an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations.
NA,In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (n=15/17) involve wound showings in the context of surgeons reporting their observations formatted with evidentials (&quot;looks neat&quot;) and subsequently assessing what these observations imply or what could be concluded from them.
NA,In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (n=3/22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation.
NA,Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments where diagnostic criteria such as redness or swollenness are made explicit.
NA,In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (&quot;I think,&quot; &quot;sounds...good&quot;) and evidentials are absent.
NA,Even in cases of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may rely on questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing.
NA,The impact of video technology on postoperative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way when compared to face-to-face consultations.
NA,In video consultations, physicians enquire and patients provide their own observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment.
NA,This means that, in video consultations, patients have a fundamentally different role.
NA,These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in cases of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial.
NA,Retrospective data from Chinese cohorts published in the last few days have placed a strong emphasis on the possibility that acute myocardial injury represents a critical component in the development of serious complications in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
NA,These analyses showed that 19-27% of hospitalized patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 developed acute myocardial injury, defined as an increase in troponin levels.
NA,Fifty-sixty percent of these patients died.
NA,The highest mortality rate was detected among patients with both progressively incremental troponin levels and a history of cardiovascular disease.
NA,Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration.
NA,In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels.
NA,In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.
NA,The integrated clinical, laboratory and ultrasound approach is essential for the diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of the patient's therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,The ideal imaging strategy in this setting is not yet well defined.
NA,Bedside pulmonary ultrasound presents an undeniable series of advantages in patients at high risk of infection, and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient, as well as for home delivery of stabilized patients.
NA,Chest X-ray is characterized by low sensitivity in identifying earlier lung changes.
NA,Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative, and in the late phase imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach.
NA,Echocardiography should be limited to patients with hemodynamic instability.
NA,The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease.
NA,The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities.
NA,If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies.
NA,In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital.
NA,The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments.
NA,Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.
NA,A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.
NA,Data changes the game in terms of how we respond to pandemics.
NA,Global data on disease trajectories and the effectiveness and economic impact of different social distancing measures are essential to facilitate effective local responses to pandemics.
NA,COVID-19 data flowing across geographic borders are extremely useful to public health professionals for many purposes such as accelerating the pharmaceutical development pipeline, and for making vital decisions about intensive care unit rooms, where to build temporary hospitals, or where to boost supplies of personal protection equipment, ventilators, or diagnostic tests.
NA,Sharing data enables quicker dissemination and validation of pharmaceutical innovations, as well as improved knowledge of what prevention and mitigation measures work.
NA,Even if physical borders around the globe are closed, it is crucial that data continues to transparently flow across borders to enable a data economy to thrive which will promote global public health through global cooperation and solidarity.
NA,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The current global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed.
NA,However, some high-risk procedures, such as those related to head and neck malignancies, cannot always be delayed.
NA,Care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible.
NA,Preoperative testing for COVID-19, limited operating room personnel, adequate personal protective equipment, and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> This article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> With detailed planning and specific techniques, the amount of aerosolization was reduced, and the procedure was performed as safely as possible. <b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> This case provides a template for future aerosol-generating procedures during respiratory pandemics.
NA,This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the clinical outcomes reported for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases were searched using a combination of key words such as &quot;Coronavirus and/or pregnancy,&quot; &quot;COVID and/or pregnancy,&quot; &quot;COVID disease and/or pregnancy,&quot; and &quot;COVID pneumonia and/or pregnancy.&quot; There was no restriction of language to allow collection of as many cases as possible.
NA,All studies of pregnant women who received a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis using acid nucleic test, with reported data about pregnancy, and, in case of delivery, reported outcomes, were included.
NA,All the studies included have been evaluated according to the tool for evaluating the methodological quality of case reports and case series described by Murad et al.
NA,Six studies that involved 51 pregnant women were eligible for the systematic review.
NA,At the time of the report, 3 pregnancies were ongoing; of the remaining 48 pregnant women, 46 gave birth by cesarean delivery, and 2 gave birth vaginally; in this study, 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death were reported.
NA,Although vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and neonates has been generally good, the high rate of preterm delivery by cesarean delivery is a reason for concern.
NA,Cesarean delivery was typically an elective surgical intervention, and it is reasonable to question whether cesarean delivery for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was warranted.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 associated with respiratory insufficiency in late pregnancies certainly creates a complex clinical scenario.
NA,COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection.
NA,Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country.
NA,Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1-3].
NA,Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low.
NA,However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples.
NA,METHODS: | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
NA,This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29.
NA,COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's ⟪pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) ⟫, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1].
NA,The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type.
NA,During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection.
NA,All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process.
NA,The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
NA,The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests.
NA,RESULTS: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times).
NA,The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times).
NA,DISCUSSION|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs).
NA,Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019.
NA,The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death.
NA,Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism.
NA,ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention.
NA,We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms.
NA,We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%.
NA,The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells.
NA,High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility.
NA,Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients.
NA,ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation.
NA,It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients' stool samples.
NA,The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.
NA,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
NA,The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin with structural similarity to the viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
NA,Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms.
NA,A minority of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome/ diffuse alveolar damage.
NA,In addition to its central role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, the clinical laboratory provides critical information to clinicians regarding prognosis, disease course, and response to therapy.
NA,The purpose of this review is to 1) provide background context about the origins and course of the pandemic 2) discuss the laboratory's role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection 3) summarize the current state of biomarker analysis in COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on markers derived from the hematology laboratory 4) comment on the impact of COVID-19 on hematology laboratory safety, and 5) describe the impact the pandemic has had on organized national and international educational activities worldwide.
NA,Patients with rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus have increased risk of infection and are treated with medications that may increase this risk yet are also hypothesized to help treat COVID-19.
NA,We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of these patients in the United States.
NA,Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by e-mail on March 25, 2020, about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, health care changes, and related experiences during the prior 2 weeks.
NA,Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms.
NA,Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields.
NA,Of the 7061 participants invited to participate, 530 responded, with RA as the most frequent diagnosis (61%).
NA,Eleven participants met COVID-19 screening criteria, of whom two sought testing unsuccessfully.
NA,Six others sought testing, three of whom were successful, and all test results were negative.
NA,Not quite half of participants (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior 2 weeks.
NA,Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications, including hydroxychloroquine.
NA,After 2 weeks, many participants with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their health care, with many altering medications without professional consultation or because of hydroxychloroquine shortage.
NA,As evidence accumulates on the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 treatments, effort is needed to safeguard access to established treatments for rheumatic diseases.
NA,A novel coronavirus, tentatively designated as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and which continues to expand.
NA,On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,On February 28, WHO increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level.
NA,The COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health.Computed tomography (CT) has been an important imaging modality in assisting in the diagnosis and management of patients withCOVID-19.
NA,Some retrospective imaging studies have reported chest CT findings of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, suggesting that several CT findings may be characteristic.
NA,To our knowledge, there has been no prospective multicentre imaging study of COVID-19 to date.We proposed a hypothesis: There are some specific CT features on Chest CT of COVID-19 patients.
NA,And the mechanism of these CT features is explicable based on pathological findings.
NA,To investigate the specific CT features of COVID-19 and the formation mechanism of these CT features.
NA,This study is a prospective multicenter observational study.
NA,We will recruit 100 patients with COVID-19 at 55 hospitals.
NA,All patients undergo chest CT examination with the same scan protocol.
NA,The distribution and morphology of lesions on chest CT, clinical data will be recorded.
NA,A number of patients will be pathologically examined after permission is granted.
NA,The data of these three aspects will be analyzed synthetically.
NA,This study will help us to identify the chest CT features of COVID-19 and its mechanism.
NA,This retrospective study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (No.
NA,2020-140).
NA,Written informed consent will be obtained from all study participants prior to enrollment in the study.
NA,To protect privacy of participants, all private information were kept anonymous.
NA,The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be disseminated electronically and in print regardless of results.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically diagnosed by specific assays that detect viral nucleic acid from the upper respiratory tract; however, this may miss infections involving only the lower airways.
NA,Computed tomography (CT) has been described as a diagnostic modality in the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan.
NA,We present a case series with virologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands.
NA,While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications.
NA,Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease, firstly appeared in Wuhan city and has rapidly spread to 114 countries outside China, which is receiving worldwide attention.
NA,As two important means of examination, computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have always been controversial in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Here, we report a family cluster case of a father and a son diagnosed as COVID-19 at our hospital, and described the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, CT changes, diagnosis and treatment strategy of these two patients.
NA,Focus on the value of these two methods in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, as well as their respective deficiencies.
NA,For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment.
NA,For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions.
NA,Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation.
NA,Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.
NA,COVID-19 threatens to quickly overwhelm our existing critical care infrastructure in the USA.
NA,Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death.
NA,Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS.
NA,Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> of &lt; 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria).
NA,Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated.
NA,Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature.
NA,The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs.
NA,71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients.
NA,When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs.
NA,75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs.
NA,168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.
NA,Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.
NA,COVID-19 is spreading almost all over the world at present, which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
NA,It was an epidemic firstly in Hubei province of China.
NA,The Chinese government has formally set COVID-19 in the statutory notification and control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
NA,China currently is still struggling to respond to COVID-19 though intensive actions with progress made.
NA,The Burn Department of our hospital is one of sections with the highest infectious risk of COVID-19.

NA,The overlap in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment.
NA,However, identifying features atypical for COVID-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of Computed Tomography Angiography among these patients.
NA,Hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13% of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among COVID-19 infections.
NA,Additionally, the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography (EKG) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with COVID-19 infections.
NA,Novel outbreak with coronavirus 2019 began since 31 December 2019.
NA,Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms.
NA,In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time.
NA,We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis.
NA,Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection.
NA,The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS.
NA,COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes.
NA,GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it.
NA,It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides.
NA,Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.
NA,Joint guidelines of the French Pediatric Otolaryngology Society (AFOP) and of the French Society of otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery (SFORL) on the management of paediatric otolaryngology patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,A nation-wide workgroup drew guidelines based on clinical experience, national and local recommendations and scientific literature.
NA,Proposals may have to be updated on a day-to-day basis.
NA,In children, incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 (1-5%) is low and of good prognosis.
NA,The indications for nasal flexible endoscopy should be drastically limited.
NA,If undertaken, full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks are required, as well as use of a sheath.
NA,Saline nose wash done by caregivers other than parents at home should require PPE.
NA,Unless foreign body tracheobronchial aspiration is clinically obvious, CT-scan should be performed to confirm indication of endoscopy.
NA,Surgical indications should be limited to emergencies and to cases that cannot be delayed beyond 2 months (especially endonasal, endopharyngeal laryngo-tracheobronchial procedures).
NA,Postponement should ideally be a group decision and recorded as such in the medical file.
NA,Surgical techniques should be adapted to limit the risk of viral dissemination in the air, avoiding the use of drills, microdebriders, monopolar cautery or lasers.
NA,Continuous suction should be placed near the operating field.
NA,In case of confirmed Covid-19 cases, or suspected cases (or in some centres systematically), PPE with FFP2 mask should be worn by all staff members present in the operating room.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is changing the way we practice pathology, including fine needle aspiration (FNA) diagnostics.
NA,Although recommendations have been issued to prioritise patients at high oncological risk, postponing those with unsuspicious presentations, real world data have not been reported yet.
NA,The percentages of the cytological sample types processed at the University of Naples Federico II, during the first 3 weeks of Italian national lockdown were compared with those of the same period in 2019.
NA,During the emergency, the percentage of cytology samples reported as malignant increased (p&lt;0.001), reflecting higher percentages of breast (p=0.002) and lymph nodes FNAs (p=0.008), effusions (p&lt;0.001) and urine (p=0.005).
NA,Conversely, thyroid FNAs (p&lt;0.001) and Pap smears (p=0.003) were reduced.
NA,Even in times of covid-19 outbreak, cytological examination may be safely carried out in patients at high oncological risk, without the need to be postponed.
NA,We have applied a computational strategy, using a combination of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CL<sup>pro</sup> of the SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus.
NA,Based on the X-ray structure (PDB code: 6LU7), ligands were generated using a multimodal structure-based design and then docked to the monomer in the active state.
NA,Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases.
NA,The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), originally reported in Wuhan, China, has rapidly proliferated throughout several continents and the first case in the United States was reported on January 19, 2020.
NA,According to the ACR guidelines issued shortly after this disease was declared a pandemic, radiologists are expected to familiarize themselves with the CT appearance of COVID-19 infection in order to be able to identify specific findings of this entity.
NA,This case report discusses the relevant imaging findings of one of the first cases in the midwestern US.
NA,It involves a 60-year-old man who presented with fever, dyspnea, and cough for 1 week and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.
NA,The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context.
NA,The stages of imaging findings in COVID-19 are considered along with the implications of fibrosis throughout the stages.
NA,Future considerations include using artificial intelligence algorithms to distinguish between community acquired pneumonias and COVID-19 infection.
NA,Saliva is an exocrine secretion produced from the salivary glands and has numerous functions, such as cleansing and protection of the oral cavity, antimicrobial effects and aids in digestion.
NA,Due to the speedy development in the field of salivaomics, saliva is now well accepted as a pool of biological markers that vary from changes in biochemicals, nucleic acids and proteins to the microflora.
NA,Saliva has an immense potential as a diagnostic fluid and offers an edge over other biological fluids as its collection method does not require invasive procedure, economical and is useful for monitoring systemic health.
NA,Development of sensitive and precise salivary diagnostic tools and the formulation of defined guidelines following meticulous testing will allow salivary diagnostics to be utilised as chair side tests for various oral and systemic diseases in the near future.
NA,The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is the biggest challenge and global health crisis for the world since World War Two.
NA,Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals.
NA,Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen types for Covid-19 diagnostic testing.
NA,The collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients and poses a risk of transmission of the virus, causes discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with condition such as thrombocytopenia.
NA,Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable for sequential monitoring of viral load.
NA,Saliva specimens can be obtained easily as the patient is asked to spit into a sterile bottle.
NA,The collection of saliva is non-invasive and greatly minimizes the exposure of healthcare workers to Covid-19.
NA,Saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90% with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses.
NA,Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms.
NA,SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers.
NA,Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care.
NA,More research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing aerosol-generating procedures.
NA,Epidemically increased evidence reveals that the link between the 2019-nCoV and other similar strain of coronaviruses circulating in bats and specifically the Rhinopodous bat sub-species.
NA,These sub-species are ample and widely present in Southern China, Middle East Africa and Europe.
NA,Recent studies show that more than 500 CoV have been identified in bats in China.
NA,The Center for Diseases Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization maintains a website that is updated frequently with new cases of MERS-CoV infection.
NA,As per WHO Situation report 16th, 24,554 number of cases confirmed globally out of which 99.22% cases from china.
NA,A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing respiratory syndrome mostly in Hubei Province, China.
NA,Corona Virus spread over 24 countries including Japan, India, Korea, and other countries 2019-CoV infection vary from mild, moderate or severe illness; the later includes severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock.
NA,There are two diagnostic tests for coronavirus infection i.e. molecular test and serology test.
NA,In this review article there are the various recent cases of the patients that are suffering from the corona virus, the outcome of these studies is that corona virus infection is an epidemic disease which affects Central Nervous System (CNS).
NA,The current pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) called SARS-CoV-2 (species <i>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</i>, subgenus <i>Sarbecovirus</i>, genus <i>Betacoronavirus</i>, family <i>Coronaviridae</i>).
NA,In Italy, up to the 2nd of April 2020, overall 139,422 confirmed cases and 17,669 deaths have been notified, while 26,491 people have recovered.
NA,Besides the overloading of hospitals, another issue to face was the capacity to perform thousands of tests per day.
NA,In this perspective, to support the National Health Care System and to minimize the impact of this rapidly spreading virus, the Italian Ministry of Health involved the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IZSs), Veterinary Public Health Institutes, in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by testing human samples.
NA,IZSAM, is currently testing more than 600 samples per day and WGS from positive samples.
NA,Sequence analysis of these samples suggested that outbreaks in Abruzzo region may be related to outbreaks of northern Italy and northern Europe, these latter as for the presence of mutations in the N protein.
NA,CoVs, and related diseases, are well known to veterinarians since decades.
NA,The experience that veterinarians operating within the Public health system gained in the control and characterization of previous health issues of livestock and poultry including avian flu, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease, responsible for huge economic losses, is certainly of great help to minimize the impact of this global crisis.
NA,In early 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to a potentially fatal condition was discovered.
NA,Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic.
NA,Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions.
NA,Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization.
NA,Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized.
NA,We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress.
NA,Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit.
NA,He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant.
NA,Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD.
NA,When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected.
NA,This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demand upon critical care services for invasive mechanical ventilation.
NA,There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure.
NA,Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020.
NA,A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team.
NA,In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation.
NA,Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment.
NA,ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role in forming tracheostomy teams to support critical care teams during this global pandemic.
NA,This document from the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) aims to present the main imaging features, and the role of CT scan in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, describing, in particular, the typical findings which make it possible to identify the disease and distinguish it from bacterial causes of infection, and to define which category of patients may benefit from CT imaging.
NA,The precautions that must be taken when performing scans to protect radiologists and technologists from infection will be described.
NA,The organisational measures that can be taken within radiology departments in order to cope with the influx of patients, while continuing to manage other emergency and time-sensitive activity (e.g. oncology, other infectious diseases etc.), will be discussed.
NA,KEY POINTS: • Bilateral ground glass opacities are typical CT manifestations of COVID-19.
NA,• Crazy paving and organising pneumonia pattern are seen at a later stage.
NA,• Extensive consolidation is associated with a poor prognosis.
NA,There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery.
NA,Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19.
NA,The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
NA,Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery.
NA,One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery.
NA,Three patients were readmitted in hospital.
NA,All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine.
NA,In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered.
NA,All patients survived.
NA,In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery.
NA,Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging.
NA,Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
NA,The initial cases of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in a country are of utmost importance given their impact on healthcare providers, the country's preparedness response, and the initial molding of the public perception toward this pandemic.
NA,In Bhutan, the index case was a 76-year-old immunocompromised man who had traveled from the United States and entered Bhutan as a tourist.
NA,He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and later a cough.
NA,His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested.
NA,On confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team.
NA,All contacts were traced and quarantined.
NA,The patient's respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals, antibiotics, and intensive supportive care.
NA,He required intubation and was given a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin to modulate his likely aberrant immune response.
NA,Subsequently, the patient's clinical status improved, and after 8 days of hospitalization, he was transferred out of the country, where he recovered.
NA,This was a learning experience for the treating medical staff, the government, and the people of Bhutan.
NA,The early shortage of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) tests in the United States led many hospitals to first screen for common respiratory pathogens, and only if this screen was negative to proceed with COVID-19 testing.
NA,We report a case of a 56-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coinfection with group A <i>Streptococcus</i>.
NA,The initial testing strategy resulted in delays in both diagnosis and implementation of appropriate precautions.
NA,Underlined is the importance of testing for both SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory pathogens during the current pandemic.
NA,The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market.
NA,It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D structures of key viral proteins are resolved.
NA,The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials.
NA,For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an end point method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area/weighted solvent-accessible surface area; Wang, <i>Chem.
NA,Rev.</i> 2019, 119, 9478; Wang, <i>Curr.

NA,Model.</i>, 2012, 52, 1199).
NA,Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir.
NA,Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.8 kcal/mol.
NA,The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic.
NA,Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.9 kcal/mol).
NA,One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.9 kcal/mol.
NA,Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified.
NA,I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
NA,The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
NA,An ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has exhibited significant threats around the world.
NA,We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice.
NA,We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020.
NA,Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported.
NA,For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves.
NA,A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge = 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death ==28).
NA,All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values.
NA,The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively.
NA,As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients.
NA,Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (&lt;500), CD3+T-cell (&lt;200), CD4+ T-cell (&lt;100), CD8+ T-cell (&lt;100) and B-cell (&lt;50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19.
NA,The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively.
NA,We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness.
NA,The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.
NA,In view of the current situation regarding the Covid-19 disease, a discussion is proposed on the need for research focusing on the presence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in water, soils and other environmental compartments, reached through wastewater and sewage sludge spreading.
NA,Also, the evaluation of current treatments for wastewater and sewage sludge, as well as the eventual development of new specific techniques, based on sorption, nanotechnology, etc., would be of great interest for controlling the environmental dissemination of these viruses in the current and eventual future outbreaks.
NA,Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency screening test is essential for malaria treatment, control, and elimination programs.
NA,G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country.
NA,We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey.
NA,We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region.
NA,Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement.
NA,The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour.
NA,Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers.
NA,The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities.
NA,Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals.
NA,This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population.
NA,The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min).
NA,The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min).
NA,Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor.
NA,Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
NA,To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.
NA,Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in devastating consequences worldwide and infected more than 350,000 individuals and killed more than 16,000 people.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to affect humans.
NA,Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
NA,COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
NA,Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
NA,The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,With the rapid spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) worldwide and the escalation of prevention and control efforts, the routine medical needs of patients have been restricted.
NA,The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment.
NA,The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4th, March, 2020, until 7am 6th, March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h.
NA,Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
NA,41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%).
NA,Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations.
NA,Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms.
NA,26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation.
NA,During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.
NA,During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
NA,When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them.
NA,At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.

NA,Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens.
NA,In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past.
NA,It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats.
NA,To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019.
NA,Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene.
NA,A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens.
NA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive.
NA,Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp.
NA,Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene.
NA,Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens.
NA,Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats.
NA,NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats.
NA,Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018.
NA,The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1.
NA,This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats.
NA,Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them.
NA,One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health.
NA,This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions.
NA,Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.
NA,As COVID-19 cases surge worldwide, an urgent need exists to enhance our understanding of the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory and cardiac compromise refractory to conventional therapy.
NA,The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare.
NA,Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge.
NA,This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020 when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020.
NA,During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at 9 different hospitals.
NA,As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital.
NA,Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.
NA,Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.
NA,These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.
NA,We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a probable COVID-19 infection in a 28-year-old man with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
NA,The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions.
NA,The COVID-19 disease appeared mild, without major respiratory problems, and no obvious neuromuscular deterioration was reported or observed.
NA,Telerehabilitation provided an opportunity to continue with hand rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery, perform an ad-hoc online evaluation, and advise the patient how to prevent the spread of infection and cope with restrictions limiting outpatient visits.
NA,This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits.
NA,Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring admission to the ICU.
NA,This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,Prospective crossover physiologic study.
NA,ICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H2O in random order.
NA,At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography.
NA,Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio.
NA,In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography.
NA,At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure.
NA,Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial CO2 increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume.
NA,The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53-1.08]; range, 0.16-1.40).
NA,The FIO2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05).
NA,The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32-45%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones.
NA,In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait.
NA,These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.
NA,As the SARS-CoV-2 virus race around the world across the different population, there needs to be a consolidated effort to understand the divergence of demographically distributed strains.
NA,The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields.
NA,Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission.
NA,Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions.
NA,It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
NA,The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region.
NA,Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.
NA,Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.
NA,The objectives of this study were to analyze the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment.
NA,A retrospective analysis of the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination of 19 patients with COVID-19 from the Liyuan Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between January 16, 2020 and February 20, 2020 was undertaken.
NA,There were 11 male and 8 female cases among the patients.
NA,The median (range) age was 73 (38-91) years.
NA,Of these patients, 8 (42.1%) had died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (interquartile range (IQR): 1-10.75) days.
NA,Seven of these 8 patients had underlying diseases.
NA,The auxiliary examination showed fever (68.4%), dry cough (15.8%), dyspnea (10.5%), and diarrhea (5.3%).
NA,All 19 cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography.
NA,Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases.
NA,Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors.
NA,There were more men than women among critically ill patients.
NA,All of the cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography and the vast majority of patients displayed fever and dry cough.
NA,The clinical laboratory indices change significantly, especially the D-dimer level among non-survivors.
NA,We retrospectively analysed 26 persistently asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) carriers.
NA,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing were obtained.
NA,Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence.
NA,The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8-24 days) and 21.5 days (10-36 days), respectively.
NA,The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (n=16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2-20 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT(n=10, 38.5%; 12.5 days[8-22 days]; P&lt;0.01).
NA,Seven patients (70.0%) with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved CT findings.
NA,Obvious improvement in CT findings was observed in three patients (30.0%) despite positive nucleic acid test results.
NA,In asymptomatic patients, changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest CT can occur.
NA,It is worth noting the long existence of SARS-CoV-2 in some asymptomatic patients and false-negative results need to be considered in SARS-CoV-2nucleic acid test.
NA,The pandemic of COVID-19 is seriously challenging the medical organization in many parts of the world.
NA,This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients.
NA,However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients.
NA,Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients.
NA,The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination.
NA,Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.
NA,An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a pandemic disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict containment measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken everywhere to hinder the spread of the virus.
NA,The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.
NA,There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19.
NA,Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention.
NA,We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities.
NA,An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.
NA,According to WHO recommendations, everyone must protect themselves against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which will also protect others.
NA,Due to the lack of current effective treatment and vaccine for COVID-19, screening, rapid diagnosis and isolation of the patients are essential (1, 2).
NA,Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority.
NA,Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4).
NA,Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8).
NA,However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.
NA,The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks.
NA,The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays.
NA,By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from 38 cases with confirmed COVID-19 in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage.
NA,However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from eighth day of disease onset.
NA,Simultaneous use of antibody assay and RT-qPCR improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses.
NA,Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days.
NA,Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection.

NA,Much has happened here since the local news media trumpeted the first Australian COVID-19 fatality, and stirred up a medieval fear of contagion.
NA,We now need to take a step back to examine the logic underlying the use of our limited COVID-19 countermeasures.
NA,Emerging infectious diseases by their nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic-treatment-control nexus, and push our concepts of causality beyond the limits of the conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology.
NA,We need to use contemporary methods of assessing causality to ensure that clinical, laboratory and public health measures draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation.
NA,The purpose of any aetiological hypothesis is to derive actionable insights into this latest emerging infectious disease.
NA,This review is an introduction to a conversation with medical microbiologists, which will be supported by a moderated blog.
NA,Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread around the world, leading to one of the most significant pandemic events of recent history.
NA,Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies.
NA,Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R<sub>0</sub>.
NA,Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.
NA,To investigate the different CT characteristics which may distinguish influenza from 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,A total of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from January 16, 2020, to February 25, 2020.
NA,Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed.
NA,Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts.
NA,Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p &gt; 0.05).
NA,Though viral pneumonias generally show similar imaging features, there are some characteristic CT findings which may help differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia.
NA,• CT can play an early warning role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the case of no epidemic exposure.
NA,• CT could be used for the differential diagnosis of influenza and COVID-19 with satisfactory accuracy.
NA,• COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities with peripheral distribution and balanced lobe predomination.
NA,The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 has impacted many lives and affects the whole healthcare systems globally.
NA,In addition to the considerable workload challenges, surgeons are faced with a number of uncertainties regarding their own safety, practice, and overall patient care.
NA,This guide has been drafted at short notice to advise on specific issues related to surgical service provision and the safety of minimally invasive surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Although laparoscopy can theoretically lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, there is no evidence available to confirm this is the case with COVID-19.
NA,The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefits of laparoscopic techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization.
NA,Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status.
NA,Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open.
NA,All emergent endoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic should be considered as high risk and PPE must be used by all endoscopy staff.
NA,In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate that our focus is on patient care and preparation.
NA,However, the genetics community is well poised to fill in the educational gap created by medical students transitioning to limiting patient contact, creation of telemedicine patient care, and online learning modules.
NA,Our history of agility in learning and teaching is now only inhibited by the time constraints of current clinical demands on the genetics community.
NA,This publication is designed to offer ideas and resources for quickly transitioning our education to meet the current demands in the time of a pandemic.
NA,Not only will this allow us to continue our strong history of education, it will enhance our strong commitment to using modern educational techniques and tools to address the genetics workforce issues that have defined the recent past.
NA,We have the opportunity to aggressively educate for trainees that now have the capacity to learn, and to lead the way in showing how the genetics community rallies together no matter the challenge.
NA,The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been a challenge for hospital laboratories because of the huge number of samples that must be tested for the presence of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Simple and rapid immunodiagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify positive cases.
NA,Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) to detect anti-SARV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum.
NA,A recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane to capture specific IgG.
NA,Mouse anti-human IgG antibody was labeled with self-assembled LNPs that served as a fluorescent reporter.
NA,A 100-μL aliquot of serum samples (1:1000 dilution) was used for this assay and the whole detection process took 10 min.
NA,The results of the validation experiment met the requirements for clinical diagnostic reagents.
NA,A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples.
NA,We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
NA,One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR.
NA,Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.
NA,A potential link between mortality, D-dimer values and a prothrombotic syndrome has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,The National Institute for Public Health of the Netherlands asked a group of Radiology and Vascular Medicine experts to provide guidance for the imaging workup and treatment of these important complications.
NA,This report summarizes evidence for thromboembolic disease, potential diagnostic and preventive actions as well as recommendations for patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has been poorly reported in solid organ transplanted patients; prognosis is uncertain and best management unclear.
NA,We describe the case of a 61-year-old kidney transplant recipient with several comorbidities who was hospitalized and later received a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia; the infection was successfully managed with the use of hydroxychloroquine and a single administration of tocilizumab, after immunosuppression reduction; the patient did not require mechanical ventilation.
NA,During the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, transplant clinicians should be readily informed about new cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in solid organ transplant recipients, with focus on therapeutic strategies employed and their outcome.
NA,In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin occured in Wuhan, China.
NA,The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) and the respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19).
NA,In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
NA,We reviewed the international literature regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak.
NA,Here below, we focus mainly on the diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis.
NA,We detail the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19.
NA,We also focus on the proper method of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We also cite the current national epidemiologic regulations of testing for novel coronavirus.
NA,In the last section, we emphasize the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk patients.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and healthcare burden even in Hungary.
NA,In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality.
NA,The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care.
NA,It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries.

NA,Critical-care physicians are facing a challenging process in healthcare due to the overwhelming case number of hypoxic respiratory failure patients.
NA,Pneumonia has an utmost importance in the primary pathomechanism of the development of critical illness in the COVID-19 patients.
NA,Thus, imaging techniques are situated in the frontline to aim the diagnostic decision-making, to follow up the progress and to evaluate the possible complications.
NA,Reviewing the available literature, so far the common chest CT, chest X-ray and chest wall ultrasound features are presented, and recommendations are pronounced for the indications of the different modalities.
NA,At the initial phase, the atypical presentations of the virus infection are multiplex, peripheral ground glass opacities situated in the right lower lobe of the lung evolving rapidly into a bilateral involvement of the middle and basal zones.
NA,Along with the progression, the ratio of the consolidation is increasing subsequently deteriorating into fibrosis with reticular pattern.
NA,Chest ultrasound performed at the bedside has a paramount importance to reduce the possible number of health-care worker contacts in consequence of the strict and special infection control orders established on account of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.

NA,Health care does not always take place in a setting of peace, prosperity, and social order, a point that is often overlooked in quotidian medical practice.
NA,This has become most evident with the current COVID-19 pandemic by the new coronavirus that is wreaking havoc across the planet.
NA,Health care providers are facing unprecedented challenges to intervene on numerous nonlinear uncertainties in science and society as the pandemic evolves.
NA,In Afghanistan, health care delivery is already a major crosscutting challenge.
NA,Although efforts to rebuild the health care systems in Afghanistan have been made (Acerra et al.), both acute and chronic illnesses remain as major medical and critical governance gaps to be remedied.
NA,In addition, health care facilities and medical equipment are not adequate in the country.
NA,There is a need for medical and scientific expertise to clinically and sociologically contextualize and interpret diagnostic tests as well as drugs and vaccines that will be deployed in the coming months as part of the planetary collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In a time of pandemic and facing a novel infectious pathogen, health care workers are in need of planetary scale consultation and support.
NA,Even creating a small consultation network using mobile applications might offer improved health outcomes.
NA,The Internet of Things and digital health ought to be considered in concert with telemedicine as part of an effective pandemic response.
NA,Routine screening CT for the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia is currently not recommended by most radiology societies.
NA,However, the number of CTs performed in persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 has increased.
NA,We also anticipate that some patients will have incidentally detected findings that could be attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring radiologists to decide whether or not to mention COVID-19 specifically as a differential diagnostic possibility.
NA,We aim to provide guidance to radiologists in reporting CT findings potentially attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, including standardized language to reduce reporting variability when addressing the possibility of COVID-19.
NA,When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection.
NA,These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,In this setting, using the term &quot;viral pneumonia&quot; can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative.
NA,However, if one opts to use the term &quot;COVID-19&quot; in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language.
NA,In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide.
NA,Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach.
NA,The goal of this expert consensus is to help radiologists recognize findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and aid their communication with other healthcare providers, assisting management of patients during this pandemic.
NA,Healthcare workers exposed to coronavirus (COVID-19) may not have adequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE), safety procedures, and diagnostic protocols.
NA,Our objective was to evaluate the reality and perceptions about personal safety among healthcare workers in Latin America.
NA,This is a cross-sectional, online survey-based study administered to 936 healthcare professionals in Latin America from 31 March 2020 to 4 April 2020.
NA,A 12-item structured questionnaire was developed.
NA,A total of 936 healthcare workers completed the online survey.
NA,Of them, 899 (95.1%) were physicians, 28 (2.9%) were nurses, and 18 (1.9%) were allied health professionals.
NA,Access to protective equipment was as follows: gel hand sanitizer (<i>n</i> = 889; 95%), disposable gloves (<i>n</i> = 853; 91.1%), disposable gowns (<i>n</i> = 630; 67.3%), disposable surgical masks (785; 83.9%), N95 masks (<i>n</i> = 516; 56.1%), and facial protective shields (<i>n</i> = 305; 32.6%).
NA,The vast majority (<i>n</i> = 707; 75.5%) had access to personal safety policies and procedures, and 699 (74.7%) participants had access to diagnostic algorithms.
NA,On a 1-to-10 Likert scale, the participants expressed limited human resources support (4.92 ± 0.2; mean ± SD), physical integrity protection in the workplace (5.5 ± 0.1; mean ± SD), and support from public health authorities (5.01 ± 0.12; mean ± SD).
NA,Healthcare workers in Latin America had limited access to essential PPE and support from healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Since 2004, we have been developing nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties, the so-called nanoantimicrobials.
NA,When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, we started investigating new and challenging routes to nanoantivirals.
NA,The two fields have some important points of contact.
NA,We would like to share with the readership our vision of the role a (nano)materials scientist can play in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,As researchers specifically working on surfaces and nanomaterials, in this letter we underline the importance of nanomaterial-based technological solutions in several aspects of the fight against the virus.
NA,While great resources are understandably being dedicated to treatment and diagnosis, more efforts could be dedicated to limit the virus spread.
NA,Increasing the efficacy of personal protection equipment, developing synergistic antiviral coatings, are only two of the cases discussed.
NA,This is not the first nor the last pandemic: our nanomaterials community may offer several technological solutions to challenge the ongoing and future global health emergencies.
NA,Readers' feedback and suggestions are warmly encouraged.
NA,The purpose of this study was to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 from those of other infectious pulmonary diseases and evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected COVID-19 patients.
NA,Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged &gt;18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled.
NA,The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests.
NA,The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups.
NA,A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative.
NA,The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram.
NA,The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura.
NA,When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively.
NA,The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P &lt; .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation.
NA,Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity.
NA,The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%.
NA,The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.
NA,Current events with the recent COVID-19 outbreak are necessitating steep learning curves for the NHS workforce.
NA,Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required.
NA,The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies.
NA,Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard.
NA,Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound.
NA,Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting.
NA,However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus.
NA,The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.
NA,The ID NOW COVID-19 (IDNCOV) assay performed on the ID Now Instrument (Abbott Diagnostics, Scarborough, Inc.
NA,Scarborough, ME) is a rapid diagnostic test that can be performed in a point of care setting equivalent to CLIA waived testing.
NA,….
NA,The current pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused an extreme burden for health care systems globally, and the number of cases is expected to continue to increase, at least in the immediate future.
NA,The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals.
NA,The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms.
NA,In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants.
NA,The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients.
NA,Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far.
NA,Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients.
NA,Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test.
NA,It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant global event in the history of infectious diseases.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact.
NA,Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS.
NA,Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this.
NA,The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia.
NA,Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity.
NA,Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan.
NA,Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD.
NA,Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality.
NA,Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged.
NA,However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city.
NA,The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.
NA,The recent appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in 2019 has started a pandemic which has involved over a million people worldwide.
NA,A matter of debate is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets.
NA,Thus, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with confirmed COVID-19.
NA,A 31-year-old man with fever, myalgia, anosmia, and ageusia was tested and found positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a pharyngeal swab.
NA,Eight days after he provided semen and urine samples in which viral RNA presence was measured using a Real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting E and S viral genes.
NA,Semen and urine samples search for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative.
NA,Although this should be interpreted cautiously, it may be possible that either the viral clearance kinetics in these matrices matches the progressive clinical recovery of the patient or that the virus was never present in these fluids at the time of the laboratory diagnosis.
NA,The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is creating serious challenges for health laboratories that seek to identify viral infections as early as possible, optimally at the earliest appearance of symptom.
NA,Indeed, there is urgent need to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodologies not only to use in health laboratory environments but also directly in places where humans circulate and spread the virus such as airports, trains, boats, and any public aggregation places.
NA,The success of a reliable and sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis relies on the identification and measurement of informative biomarkers from human host and virus in a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive manner.
NA,The objective of this article is to describe an innovative multidisciplinary approach to develop an efficient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use portable instrument (bCUBE<sup>®</sup> by Hyris Ltd) that can be employed as a surveillance system for the emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A solution for Coronavirus testing, compliant with CDC guidelines, is scheduled to be released in the next weeks.
NA,In addition, we will describe a workflow and path of an integrated multi-omic approach that will lead to host and pathogen biomarker discovery in order to train the instrument to provide reliable results based on a specific biomarker's fingerprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 has been spread to 26 countries around the world since its outbreak.
NA,By February 16, 2020, more than 68 000 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,Researchers from all over the world have carried out timely studies on this public health emergency and produced a number of scientific publications.
NA,This review aims to re-analyze and summarize the current research findings in a timely manner to guide scholars in relevant fields to further SARS-CoV-2 research and assist healthcare professionals in their work and decision-making.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 related terms were selected in both English and Chinese and were searched in several major databases, including Pubmed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases.
NA,The reference list of each search result was screened for relevance, which was further supplemented to the search results.
NA,The included studies were categorized by topics with key characteristics extracted, re-analyzed, and summarized.
NA,A total of 301 articles were finally included with 136 in Chinese and 165 in English.
NA,The number of publications has rapidly increased since mid-January, 2020, and a peak day was 6th February on which 50 articles were published.
NA,The top three countries publishing articles were China, the United States and the United Kingdom.
NA,The <i>Lancet</i> and its specialty journals have published the most articles, with contribution also from journals such as <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> ( <i>NEJM</i>), <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i> ( <i>JAMA</i>), and <i>Nature</i>.
NA,All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention &amp; control, and others.
NA,The literatures related to SARS-CoV-2 are emerging rapidly.
NA,It is necessary to sort out and summarize the research topic in time, which has a good reference value for staff in different positions.
NA,At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the judgment of the quality of literatures.

NA,Recently a COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has broken out over the world.
NA,In order to better control the spread of the pandemic, there's an urgent need to extensively study the virus' origin and the mechanisms for its infectivity and pathogenicity.
NA,Spike protein is a special structural protein on the surface of coronavirus.
NA,It contains important information about the evolution of the virus and plays critical roles in the processes of cellular recognition and entry.
NA,In the past decades, spike protein has always been one of the most important objects in research works on coronaviruses closely related to human life.
NA,In this review we introduce these research works related to spike proteins, hoping it will provide reasonable ideas for the control of the current pandemic, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
NA,最近，一种由新型冠状病毒 2019-nCoV 引起的 COVID-19 肺炎疫情在全球暴发。
NA,为了更好地控制疫情的蔓延，亟需对 2019-nCoV 的来源、传播和致病机制进行深入研究。
NA,刺突（spike）蛋白是冠状病毒表面特有的结构蛋白，包含了冠状病毒自然演化的重要信息，并在病毒识别和入侵人体细胞的过程中起到关键作用。
NA,最近十几年，在对与人类密切相关的冠状病毒的研究中，spike 蛋白一直是最为重要的研究对象之一。
NA,而在 COVID-19 肺炎疫情暴发后，2019-nCoV 病毒表面的 spike 蛋白也迅速成为研究的焦点。
NA,本文旨在通过介绍 spike 蛋白相关研究，以期为当前疫情的防控以及 COVID-19 的诊断和治疗提供合理的研究思路。.
NA,Public health measures are needed to resolve the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, although a looming economic fallout merits close attention.
NA,Early safe reintroduction of immune individuals into the workforce may be essential to protecting the economic welfare of communities.
NA,Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing, our primary diagnostic tool to date, has sensitivity and timing concerns, owing to sampling/handling errors, as well as a complex virus-host interaction.
NA,Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays do not establish immune status once the virus has been cleared.
NA,Targeted serosurveillance for the determination of individuals' potential for transmissibility, particularly if paired with direct pathogen testing, may aid in &quot;cleared for business&quot; decision-making.
NA,Concerns about the prevention and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as it is crucial in contagious epidemics that travel and transfer of the patients be minimal for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups.
NA,Telemedicine or telehealth can play an important role, especially with previous successful experiences in the management of acute infectious respiratory epidemics such as SARS and MERS.
NA,In order to better control the rapid spread of coronavirus and manage the COVID-19 crisis, both developed and developing countries can improve the efficiency of their health system by replacing a proportion of face-to-face clinical encounters with telehealth.
NA,Recent technological advancement facilitates this reform, but there is a need for national or state-wide rules and regulations to be adapted accordingly.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of severe respiratory illness (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China and is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.
NA,The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation.
NA,In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite.
NA,Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
NA,Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted.
NA,However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
NA,Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.
NA,Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)-related pneumonia, referred to as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19), is a public health emergency as it carries high morbidity, mortality, and has no approved specific pharmacological treatments.
NA,In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.
NA,This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent.
NA,Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).
NA,We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS.
NA,All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab.
NA,Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers.
NA,Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.
NA,Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.
NA,Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.
NA,Multidisciplinary conferences (MDC) are an important component of head and neck oncologic care including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.
NA,Virtual MDC allows for improved collaboration between providers at distant sites and proper allocation of health care resources in a time of crisis.
NA,When approached systematically, a virtual MDC is feasible to design and implement in a large academic medical center with multiple satellite hospitals.
NA,This commentary provides a timely evidence-based overview on the impact of COVID-19 on dental care and oral health and identifies gaps in protection of patients and staff in dental settings.
NA,Oral symptoms are prominent before fever and cough occur.
NA,Dental professionals may play an important role in early identification and diagnosis of patients with COVID-19.
NA,With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment.
NA,Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment.
NA,The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response.
NA,Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.
NA,A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading throughout the world.
NA,Though molecular diagnostic tests are the gold standard for COVID-19, serological testing is emerging as a potential surveillance tool, in addition to its complementary role in COVID-19 diagnostics.
NA,Indubitably quantitative serological testing provides greater advantages than qualitative tests but today there is still little known about serological diagnostics and what the most appropriate role quantitative tests might play.
NA,Sixty-one COVID-19 patients and 64 patients from a control group were tested by iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG.
NA,All COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction result.
NA,The highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer's cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes.
NA,The receiver operating characteristic curves showed area under the curve values of 0.918 and 0.980 for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG, respectively. iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer has shown highly accurate results for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies profile and can be considered an excellent tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019.
NA,Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections.
NA,However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate.
NA,To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests.
NA,Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed.
NA,Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response.
NA,The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method.
NA,A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.
NA,This study is to investigate the clinical characteristics of late pregnancy with asymptomatic 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection, evaluate the outcome of maternal and fetal prognosis, and identify the evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission.
NA,A 22-years-old pregnant woman with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection who was admitted to our hospital on 11 February 2020 was enrolled in this study.
NA,Clinical data including laboratory test results and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning were collected and reviewed.
NA,Diagnosis of late pregnancy with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was made.
NA,Lumbar anesthesia for cesarean section was performed and a female baby was delivered uneventfully, with the Apgar score of 9 to 10 points.
NA,Three times of COVID-19 nucleic acid test for the baby was negative after delivery.
NA,The puerpera returned to normal after the operation and two times of throat swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were all negative after antiviral therapy.
NA,We reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 pregnant woman with detailed clinical information and our result indicated that for late pregnant women with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, there might be no intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.
NA,In December 2019, a new virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets and object infected with droplets containing the virus.
NA,The diagnosis is made employing quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to identify the viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens or blood samples.
NA,With the rapidly expanding pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, there is concern that solid organ transplant recipients will be particularly vulnerable to infection and may experience a more severe clinical course.
NA,We report four cases of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients including recipients of kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplants.
NA,We describe each patient's medical history including transplantation history, their clinical presentation and workup, and their course from diagnosis to either hospital discharge or to improvement in symptoms.
NA,These reports demonstrate a range of symptoms, clinical severity, and disease course in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19, including two hospitalized patients and two patients managed entirely in the outpatient setting.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported recently, its transcriptomic architecture is unknown.
NA,Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome.
NA,DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events.
NA,In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift.
NA,Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA.
NA,Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the modification and the 3' tail.
NA,Functional investigation of the unknown transcripts and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The accuracy of commercially available tests for COVID-19 in Brazil remains unclear.
NA,We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil.
NA,We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models.
NA,We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests.
NA,Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se=82% [76-87]; Sp=97% [96-98]; DOR=168 [92-305] and SROC=0.98 [0.96-0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se=97% [90-99]; Sp=98% [97-99]; DOR=1994 [385-10334] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se=97% [85-99]; Sp=99% [77-100]; DOR=2649 [30-233056] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00].
NA,These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
NA,However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil.
NA,Future studies addressing the diagnostic performance of tests for COVID-19 in the Brazilian population are urgently needed.
NA,Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment.
NA,We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19.
NA,In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases.
NA,Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing.
NA,When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection.
NA,Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering.
NA,The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020.
NA,All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative.
NA,This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing.
NA,ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320.
NA,Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore.
NA,Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

NA,When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance.
NA,Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions.
NA,We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
NA,We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave.
NA,We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day.
NA,We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic.
NA,From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China.
NA,We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7·1 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·8-10·9) from version 1 to 2, 2·8 times (1·9-4·2) from version 2 to 4, and 4·2 times (2·6-7·3) from version 4 to 5.
NA,If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000-359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported.
NA,The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases.
NA,These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

NA,COVID-19 pandemics is a challenge for public health and infectious diseases clinicians, especially for the therapeutical approach that is not yet adequately defined.
NA,Amid this situation, investigational agents are being used, including chloroquine.
NA,We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia that recovered in Colombia, after the use of chloroquine and clarithromycin.
NA,A 34-year-old male, returning from Spain, presented with complaints of fever, and cough, and class-II obesity, being hospitalized.
NA,The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested by FilmArray<sup>®</sup> PCR were negative.
NA,Two days later, clarithromycin was started because the patient was suspected as community-acquired pneumonia.
NA,At the third day, the rRT-PCR confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,A day later, chloroquine was started because of that.
NA,His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis.
NA,Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative.
NA,The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days.
NA,Our patient improved significantly.
NA,This and other COVID-19 cases are urgently demanding results from clinical trials that support evidence-based therapeutical approaches to this pandemic and the clinical management of patients, especially those at critical care.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is causing global morbidity and mortality, straining health systems, and disrupting society, putting individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) at risk of significant harm.
NA,In this Special Article, we examine the current and expected impact of the pandemic on individuals with ADRD.
NA,We discuss and propose mitigation strategies for: the risk of COVID-19 infection and its associated morbidity and mortality for individuals with ADRD; the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis and clinical management of ADRD; consequences of societal responses to COVID-19 in different ADRD care settings; the effect of COVID-19 on caregivers and physicians of individuals with ADRD; mental hygiene, trauma, and stigma in the time of COVID-19; and the potential impact of COVID-19 on ADRD research.
NA,Amid considerable uncertainty, we may be able to prevent or reduce the harm of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread across the globe.
NA,As part of the worldwide response, many molecular diagnostic platforms have been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.
NA,Our objective was to evaluate three sample-to-answer molecular diagnostic platforms (Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [Xpert Xpress], Abbott ID NOW™ COVID-19 [ID NOW], GenMark ePlex® SARS-CoV-2 Test [ePlex]) to determine analytical sensitivity, clinical performance, and workflow for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from 108 symptomatic patients.
NA,We found that the Xpert Xpress had the lowest limit of detection (100% detection at 100 copies/mL), followed by the ePlex (100% detection at 1,000 copies/mL), and the ID NOW (20,000 copies/mL).
NA,The Xpert Xpress also had highest positive percent agreement (PPA) when compared to our reference standard (98.3%) followed by the ePlex (91.4%) and ID now (87.7%).
NA,All three assays showed 100% negative percent agreement (NPA).
NA,In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen (∼17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress (∼46 minutes) and the ePlex (∼1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance.
NA,The ePlex had the longest time to results and showed a slight improvement in PPA over the ID NOW.
NA,Information about the clinical and analytical performance of these assays, as well as workflow, will be critical in making informed and timely decisions on testing platform.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and there are currently no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines available.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
NA,In this report, we generate a recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1.
NA,A fusion protein containing an ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity is also used in this study.
NA,The fusion proteins are then characterized.
NA,Both fusion proteins have a high binding affinity for the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit desirable pharmacological properties in mice.
NA,Moreover, the fusion proteins neutralize virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in vitro.
NA,As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they have potential applications in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new infectious disease that first emerged in Hubei province, China, in December 2019, which was found to be associated with a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan.
NA,Airway epithelial cells from infected patients were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named the SARS-CoV-2, on January 12, 2020, which is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans.
NA,Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome sequences obtained from infected patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV.
NA,The possible person-to-person disease rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries.
NA,Without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs, early detection and isolation become essential against novel Coronavirus.
NA,In this review, we introduced current diagnostic methods and criteria for the SARS-CoV-2 in China and discuss the advantages and limitations of the current diagnostic methods, including chest imaging and laboratory detection.
NA,In the early February, 2020, we called up an experts' committee with more than 30 Chinese experts from 11 national medical academic organizations to formulate the first edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children, which has been published in this journal.
NA,With accumulated experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently.
NA,The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children.
NA,In the current version, diagnosis and treatement criteria have been optimized, and early identification of severe and critical cases is highlighted.
NA,The early warning indicators for severe pediatric cases have been summarized which is utmost important for clinical practice.
NA,This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.
NA,Patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) typically present with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with a peripheral distribution.
NA,The utility of point-of-care ultrasound has been suggested, but detailed descriptions of lung ultrasound findings are not available.
NA,We evaluated lung ultrasound findings in 10 patients admitted to the internal medicine ward with COVID-19.
NA,All of the patients had characteristic glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (white lung).
NA,Thick irregular pleural lines and confluent B lines were also present in all of the patients.
NA,Five of the 10 patients had small subpleural consolidations.
NA,Point-of-care lung ultrasound has multiple advantages, including lack of radiation exposure and repeatability.
NA,Also, lung ultrasound has been shown to be more sensitive than a chest radiograph in detecting alveolar-interstitial syndrome.
NA,The utilization of lung ultrasound may also reduce exposure of healthcare workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 and may mitigate the shortage of personal protective equipment.
NA,Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.
NA,The pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the world has caused a large infected population suffering from COVID-19.
NA,To curb the spreading of the virus, WHO urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing; thus, a rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed.
NA,We applied a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to achieve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min.
NA,We designed four sets of LAMP primers (6 primers in each set), targeting the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions of orf1ab, S gene and N gene.
NA,A colorimetric change was used to report the results, which enables the outcome of viral RNA amplification to be read by the naked eye without the need of expensive or dedicated instrument.
NA,The sensitivity can be 80 copies of viral RNA per ml in a sample.
NA,We validated the RT-LAMP method in a hospital in China, employing 16 clinic samples with 8 positives and 8 negatives.
NA,The testing results are consistent with the conventional RT-qPCR.
NA,In addition, we also show that one-step process without RNA extraction is feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample.
NA,This rapid, simple and sensitive RT-LAMP method paves a way for a large screening at public domain and hospitals, particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areas.
NA,A severe form of pneumonia, is the leading complication of the respiratory Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), recently renamed SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction.
NA,In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n = 21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n = 54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020).
NA,PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR = 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p &lt; 0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.001), LDH (r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001) and PCT (r = 0.72, p &lt; 0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay.
NA,In fact patients showing PSP values higher than 250 ng/L (cut-off for risk stratification) did stay in ICU for a significantly longer time (median 17 days, IQR 12-31; p &lt; 0.001) than those exhibiting lower values (median 10 days, IQR 7-18).
NA,The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.
NA,The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has affected virtually all aspects of patient care.
NA,Health-care systems around the world are trying simultaneously to treat patients with COVID-19, prepare for its long-term impacts, and treat patients with other acute and chronic diseases.
NA,There are multiple ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly affect patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly given their common risk factors for poor outcomes.
NA,Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities.
NA,The purpose of this review is to summarize how COVID-19 has impacted key components of the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD as well as to provide strategies to mitigate these challenges.
NA,We further review major obstacles for researchers and identify priority areas for future ILD research related to COVID-19.
NA,Our goals are to provide practical considerations to support the care of patients with ILD during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a road map for clinicians caring for these patients during future infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated disease (COVID-19) outbreak seriously challenges globally all health care systems and professionals.
NA,Expert projections estimate that despite social distancing and lockdown being practiced, we have yet to feel the full impact of COVID-19.
NA,In this manuscript we provide guidance to prepare for the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer patients and advise on how to triage, prioritize and organize diagnostic procedures, surgical, radiation and medical treatments.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak grows exponentially in our country.
NA,Despite most of patients develops benign symptoms, cancer patients are at risk of a severe form of the disease.
NA,Radiotherapy centres are a potential contamination place due to the number of patients treated and staff present.
NA,Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19.
NA,In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management.
NA,This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus.
NA,Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources.
NA,The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures.
NA,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 by molecular diagnostic laboratories.
NA,We developed a multiplex rRT-PCR methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR: the Sarbecovirus specific E gene, the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene, and the human ABL1 gene as an internal control.
NA,Good correlation of C<sub>q</sub> values was observed between the simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR methodologies.
NA,Low copies (&lt;25 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method.
NA,The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection has now a global resonance.
NA,Data on how COVID-19 is affecting immunocompromised patients are however few.
NA,With our study we aimed to systematically review the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in children and adults with immunosuppression, to evaluate outcomes in this special population.
NA,A systematic review of literature was carried out to identify relevant articles, searching the EMBASE, Medline, and Google Scholar databases.
NA,Studies reporting data on pre-defined outcomes and related to immunosuppressed adults and children with SARS-CoV-2 were included.
NA,Sixteen relevant articles were identified with 110 immunosuppressed patients, mostly presenting cancer, along with transplantation and immunodeficiency.
NA,Cancer was more often associated with a more severe course, but not necessarily with a bad prognosis.
NA,Our data show that both children and adults with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population.
NA,Immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 seem to be few in relation to the overall figures, and to present a favorable outcome as compared to other comorbidities.
NA,This might be explained by a hypothetical protective role of a weaker immune response, determining a milder disease presentation and thus underdiagnosis.
NA,Nevertheless, surveillance on this special population should be encouraged.
NA,This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
NA,Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels.
NA,From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work.
NA,The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%).
NA,There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. &gt;95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective.
NA,Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce.
NA,The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.
NA,Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, mainly causing inflammatory lesions in the lungs, and can also cause damage to the intestine and liver.
NA,The rapid spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has posed complex challenges to global public health.
NA,Early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment are the most effective means of prevention and control.
NA,At present, the epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection has tended to be controlled in China, and it is still in a period of rapid rise in much of the world.
NA,The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of coronavirus nucleic acids, but imaging has an important role in the detection of lung lesions, stratification, evaluation of treatment strategies, and differentiation of mixed infections.
NA,This Chinese expert consensus statement summarizes the imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia and may help radiologists across the world to understand this disease better.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world.
NA,The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002.
NA,This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery.
NA,By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?
NA,CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations.
NA,This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality.
NA,Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world.
NA,Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment.
NA,Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.
NA,This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19.
NA,Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-2.
NA,The unexpected pandemic set off by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe panic among people worldwide.
NA,COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease.
NA,In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2).
NA,This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures.
NA,COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction.
NA,Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective.
NA,As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus.
NA,This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP).
NA,More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
NA,[BMB Reports 2020; 53(4): 191-205].
NA,The great pulmonary affectation produced by the COVID-19 infection, requires a fast diagnostic tool that complements the diagnostic test by PCR and which is also useful in evaluating the progression of lung lesions.
NA,Since most of these are peripheral, in this consensus document we propose the use of thoracic ultrasound for early diagnosis and for the daily evaluation of the progression of lung lesions by a single explorer without the need to use the chest CT.
NA,In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.
NA,These findings will facilitate the decision making regarding the patient management, both when deciding the place of admission of the patient and the type of treatment to be prescribed.
NA,A novel coronavirus, officially termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019.
NA,Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease.
NA,The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.
NA,Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care.
NA,Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the globe, and millions of people may be affected.
NA,While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features and diagnostic tools of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving, uncertainties surrounding various aspects of its optimal management strategies persist.
NA,A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
NA,Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs.
NA,The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury.
NA,As we await more data from treating these patients, this strategy is likely to help reduce potential complications.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,First identified in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December of 2019, it has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020.
NA,In this study, we will provide a brief review of viral origin, identification, symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain.
NA,Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, the order Nidovirales, and the genus Coronavirus.
NA,They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.
NA,Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses.
NA,CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.
NA,A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).
NA,This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans.
NA,The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals.
NA,It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling.
NA,Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications.
NA,The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.
NA,The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
NA,It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
NA,Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
NA,Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.
NA,Patients with Covid-19 disease commonly present with symptoms related to respiratory illness, and less commonly they develop cardiovascular complications either on presentation or during the course of the disease.
NA,The mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular involvement.
NA,Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical emergency which needs immediate coronary re-perfusion for better patient outcomes.
NA,Here we present a patient who presented to the emergency room with acute STEMI and later tested positive for COVID-19.
NA,She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,We need more research in Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular involvement for early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective treatment.
NA,The first case of pneumonia subsequently attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province on December 8, 2019.
NA,The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties.
NA,A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus.
NA,A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea.
NA,She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties.
NA,A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs.
NA,The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years.
NA,Her blood pressure was well controlled.
NA,On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17.
NA,The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction.
NA,However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out.
NA,A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia.
NA,Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.
NA,Early classification of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is essential for disease cure and control.
NA,Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region.
NA,Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients.
NA,However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate.
NA,Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals' precious time.
NA,In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (-ve).
NA,Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE).
NA,Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images.
NA,Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate.
NA,Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has broken out in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly.
NA,Recent studies have found that ⁓ 15.7% of patients develop severe pneumonia, and cytokine storm is an important factor leading to rapid disease progression.
NA,Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes.
NA,IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm.
NA,Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials.
NA,In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)&quot; in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.
NA,Lung ultrasound has recently been suggested by the Chinese Critical Care Ultrasound Study Group and Italian Academy of Thoracic Ultrasound as an accurate tool to detect lung involvement during COVID-19.
NA,Although chest Computer Tomography (CT) represents the gold standard to assess lung involvement, with a specificity even superior to the nasal/pharyngeal swab for diagnosis, lung ultrasound examination can be a valid alternative to CT scan, with some advantages, particularly desirable for pregnant women.
NA,Indeed, ultrasound can be performed directly at bed side by a single operator, reducing the risk of spreading the outbreak among health professionals, as well as it is a radiation free exam making to be easier monitoring those patients who require serial exams.
NA,In the present study, we reported four cases of pregnant women affectd by COVID-19 infection who have been monitoring with lung ultrasound examination.
NA,All patients showed ultrasound features indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia at admission: irregular pleural lines and vertical artifacts (B-lines) were observed in all four cases, whereas patchy areas of white lung in two cases.
NA,LUS was more sensitive than chest X-ray in detecting COVID-19.
NA,Three patients had resolution of lung pathology at ultrasound after 96 h of admission.
NA,Two pregnancies are ongoing, whereas two patients had cesarean delivery with no fetal complications.
NA,PCR testing of both cord blood and newborn swabs were negative in both cases.

NA,COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health crisis threatening humanity at this point in time.
NA,Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites.
NA,It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case.
NA,Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms.
NA,Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing.
NA,Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children.
NA,The case fatality rate is low in children.
NA,Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase - Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab).
NA,Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results.
NA,Management is mainly supportive care.
NA,In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered.
NA,As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation.
NA,Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present.
NA,An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel.
NA,To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised.
NA,As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.
NA,Purpose To introduce the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) for standardized assessment of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT and report its initial interobserver agreement and performance.
NA,Methods The Dutch Radiological Society (NVvR) developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as Lung-RADS or BI-RADS.
NA,CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).
NA,The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 +/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR).
NA,Eight observers assessed the scans using CO-RADS.
NA,Fleiss' kappa was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared to the median of the remaining seven observers.
NA,The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations.
NA,Fleiss' kappa was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.47), with the highest kappa for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI 0.54-0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.72).
NA,The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis.
NA,The false negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was 9/161 (5.6%, 95% CI 1.0-10%), and the false positive rate for CO-RADS 5 was 1/286 (0.3%, 95% CI 0-1.0%).
NA,Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.
NA,Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 broke out in Wuhan in December 2019.
NA,We utilized confirmed cases outside Hubei Province to analyze epidemiologic characteristics and evaluate the effect of traffic restrictions implemented in Hubei beginning on January 23, 2020.
NA,Information on 7,015 confirmed cases from January 19 to February 8, 2020, in all provinces outside Hubei was collected from the national and local health commissions in China.
NA,Incubation period and interval times were calculated using dates of the following events: contact with an infected person, onset, first visit and diagnosis.
NA,We evaluated changes in incubation period and interval times.
NA,The average age of all cases was 44.24 years old.
NA,The median incubation period was 5 days and extended from 2 days on January 23 to 15 days on February 8.
NA,The proportion of imported cases decreased from 85.71% to 33.19% after January 23.
NA,In addition, the lengths of the intervals between onset and diagnosis, onset and first visit, and first visit and diagnosis decreased over time.
NA,Rapidly transmitting COVID-19 has a short incubation period.
NA,The onset mainly occurs among young to middle-aged adults.
NA,Traffic restrictions played an important role in the decreased number of imported cases outside Hubei.
NA,As COVID-19 disease escalates globally, optimising patient outcome during this catastrophic healthcare crisis is the number one priority.
NA,The principles of patient blood management are fundamental strategies to improve patient outcomes and should be given high priority in this crisis situation.
NA,The aim of this expert review is to provide clinicians and healthcare authorities with information regarding how to apply established principles of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In particular, this review considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply and specifies important aspects of donor management.
NA,We discuss how preventative and control measures implemented during the COVID-19 crisis could affect the prevalence of anaemia, and highlight issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients requiring elective or emergency surgery.
NA,In addition, we review aspects related to patient blood management of critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and discuss important alterations of the coagulation system in patients hospitalised due to COVID-19.
NA,Finally, we address special considerations pertaining to supply-demand and cost-benefit issues of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first found in Wuhan, China and soon was reported all around the world.
NA,All confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Wenzhou from January 19 to February 20, 2020, were collected and analyzed.
NA,Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases.
NA,Among severe cases, 9 were treated in ICU.
NA,The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group).
NA,The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001).
NA,In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P values &lt; 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925.
NA,The odds ratio of the delay in days to the start of the increase of eosinophil count for predicting the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 was 2.291 after age adjusted.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 have abnormal peripheral blood routine examination results.
NA,Dynamic surveillance of peripheral blood system especially eosinophils is helpful in the prediction of severe COVID-19 cases.
NA,National efforts are underway to prepare our health service for the pandemic of COVID-19; however, the efficacy of these interventions is unknown.
NA,In view of this, we carried out a cross-sectional survey of front line healthcare workers (HCW) at two large acute NHS hospital Trusts in England, to assess their confidence and perceived level of preparedness for the virus.
NA,We demonstrate that there has been moderate success in readying HCW to manage COVID-19, but that more still needs to be done, particularly in relation to educating HCW about the laboratory diagnostics.
NA,The full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown.
NA,This perspective paper reviews the following: current COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential therapies; care considerations unique to HCT recipients; and the concept of a learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices and to optimize patient outcomes through facilitating shared learning and experience across transplantation centers.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled.
NA,However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening.
NA,We established a method to estimate instant case fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in China.
NA,We collected 82735 confirmed cases released officially by Chinese authorities from Dec 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020.
NA,The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on median cure time or median death time of individual cases.
NA,Afterward, instant fatality rate was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date.
NA,In China, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from Jan 1 to Jan 17, and then gradually declined and stabilized at 5.7% in April.
NA,The average case fatality rate in China was 6.1%±2.9%.
NA,While, the case fatality rate was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei.
NA,The cure rates of COVID-19 were 93.9%±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0%±0.4% in China except Hubei.
NA,The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was much higher than that in China except Hubei.
NA,The case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was underestimated.
NA,There has been a global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019.
NA,Here, we describe the case of a 49-year-old male undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) who got infected with COVID-19 and our experience in performing HD for him.
NA,The patient's symptoms and lung imaging changes were atypical.
NA,However, his lymphocyte range decreased upon admission and the polymerase chain reaction of the pharyngeal swab for the -COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive.
NA,The patient developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation 8 days after admission.
NA,In the end, he died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
NA,The difficulties in diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of COVID-19 in maintenance HD patients are discussed in this report.

NA,Digital health is uniquely positioned to enhance the way we detect and manage infectious diseases.
NA,This commentary explores the potential of implementing digital technologies that can be used at different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, including data-driven disease surveillance, screening, triage, diagnosis, and monitoring.
NA,Methods that could potentially reduce the exposure of healthcare providers to the virus are also discussed.
NA,The current emergency due to the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a great concern for global public health.
NA,Already in the past, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross-species borders and further underlines the importance of identifying new-targeted drugs.
NA,An ideal antiviral agent should target essential proteins involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV.
NA,Currently, some HIV protease inhibitors (i.e., Lopinavir) are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness has not yet been assessed.
NA,The main protease (M<sup>pr</sup>) provides a highly validated pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors.
NA,We identified potent M<sup>pr</sup> inhibitors employing computational techniques that entail the screening of a Marine Natural Product (MNP) library.
NA,MNP library was screened by a hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches.
NA,Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed this study to highlight some crucial aspects.
NA,Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pr</sup> inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin.
NA,As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has quickly become a global pandemic since its initial outbreak in China in late 2019.
NA,Institutions are faced with the challenge of upholding the standard of care while maintaining safety for health care personnel and patients.
NA,Due to the common performance of aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures in the upper respiratory tract, otolaryngologists are at uniquely high risk for potential infection.
NA,When possible, alternative diagnostic and treatment strategies should be pursued.
NA,For patients suspected of having functional laryngeal abnormalities, transcervical laryngeal ultrasound provides a rapid and noninvasive evaluation of vocal fold motion to inform decisions about safety of feeding, airway, and progression of care.
NA,There is accumulating anecdotal evidence that anosmia and dysgeusia are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,To investigate their relationship to SARS-CoV2 infection, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery developed the COVID-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians for the basis of this pilot study.
NA,This tool allows health care providers to confidentially submit cases of anosmia and dysgeusia related to COVID-19.
NA,We analyzed the first 237 entries, which revealed that anosmia was noted in 73% of patients prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6%.
NA,Some improvement was noted in 27% of patients, with a mean time to improvement of 7.2 days in this group (85% of this group improved within 10 days).
NA,Our findings suggest that anomia can be a presenting symptom of COVID-19, consistent with other emerging international reports.
NA,Anosmia may be critical in timely identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 who may be unwittingly transmitting the virus.
NA,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 represents a special risk for renal patients due to their comorbidities and advanced age.
NA,The usual performance of hemodialysis treatments in collective rooms increases the risk.
NA,The specific information at this time in this regard is very limited.
NA,This manuscript includes a proposal for action to prevent infection in the Nephrology Services, and in particular in Hemodialysis Units, with the objective of early identification of patients who meet the definition of a suspected case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and propose circuits and mechanisms to carry out hemodialysis treatments.
NA,They are recommendations in continuous review and can be modified if the epidemiological situation, the diagnostic and therapeutic options so require.
NA,In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
NA,On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
NA,As of February 14, 2020, 49,053 laboratory-confirmed and 1,381 deaths have been reported globally.
NA,Perceived risk of acquiring disease has led many governments to institute a variety of control measures.
NA,We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic.
NA,In this literature review, the causative agent, pathogenesis and immune responses, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and management of the disease, control and preventions strategies are all reviewed.
NA,From December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 was reported in China.
NA,Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide.
NA,In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
NA,The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service.
NA,Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies.
NA,In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals.
NA,An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners.
NA,This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.
NA,With the surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide, the medical community should be aware of atypical clinical presentations to help with correct diagnosis, to take the proper measures to place the patient in isolation and to avoid healthcare professionals being infected by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,To report that patients who subsequently test positive for COVID-19 may present with acute abdominal pain and no pulmonary symptoms, although they already have typical lung lesions on computed tomography (CT) scan.
NA,This case series is about three patients who presented to the emergency department of a community hospital in Montpellier, France, with acute abdominal pain.
NA,The three patients had an elevated C-reactive protein level.
NA,CT scans demonstrated no abdominal anomaly, but bilateral lung lesions at the lung bases, typical of COVID-19 lesions, were observed.
NA,COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were positive for the three patients.The patients were transferred to the COVID-19 centre for disease control at Montpellier University Hospital.
NA,As of 29 March 2020, two of those patients are still intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the third was discharged home.
NA,COVID-19 infections may present as an acute abdominal pain.
NA,In our case series, CT scan findings helped us to suspect the correct diagnosis, which was subsequently confirmed with COVID-19 RT-PCR tests.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first discovered in December 2019 as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
NA,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population.
NA,Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically.
NA,To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19 positive patients.
NA,In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Modified CDC), the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular), GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 assay (GenMark) and the Hologic Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic).
NA,This information is crucial for both laboratories and clinical teams, as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made.
NA,With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shifting of clinical care to telemedicine visits has been hastened.
NA,Because of current limitations in resources, many elective surgeons have been forced to venture into utilizing telemedicine, in which the standards for orthopaedic examinations have not previously been fully developed.
NA,We report our experience with protocols and methods to standardize these visits to maximize the benefit and efficiency of the virtual orthopaedic examination.
NA,At the time of scheduling, patients are asked to prepare for their virtual visit and are given a checklist.
NA,In addition to confirming audiovisual capabilities prior to the visit, patients are given specific instructions on camera positioning, body positioning, setting, and attire to improve the efficiency of the visit.
NA,During the examination, digital tools can be utilized as needed.
NA,In the setting of outpatient injury evaluations, a systematic virtual examination can aid in triaging and managing common musculoskeletal conditions.
NA,With the rapid incorporation of telehealth visits, as well as the unknown future with regard to the pandemic, the utilization and capabilities of telemedicine will continue to expand.
NA,Future directions include the development of validated, modified examination techniques and new technology that will allow for improved interactive physical examinations, as we rapidly move forward into the realm of telemedicine due to unexpected necessity.
NA,Timely analysis of the laboratory characteristics associated with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) can assist with clinical diagnosis and prognosis.
NA,This study is a collection of clinical data from 54 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Zhongfa Xincheng district of China at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 28, 2020 to February 11, 2020.
NA,The average age of the patients was 61.8 ± 14.5 years, and the predominant age group was 50-79.
NA,The proportion of critical-type patients with comorbidities was higher than that of severe-type patients.
NA,Lymphocyte counts were significantly reduced in routine bloodwork for all patients, but significantly lower in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients.
NA,Prolongation of prothrombin times (PT) and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers (D-Ds) were detected in coagulation function tests, and more significant changes were observed in critical-type patients compared to severe-type patients.
NA,Serum ferritin levels were sensitive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but could not be used for disease assessment.
NA,In addition, levels of two inflammatory factors, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in all patients, but higher in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients.
NA,Moreover, kidney injury was the second-most common organ affected by COVID-19 followed by heart and liver.
NA,Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients.
NA,All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered.
NA,Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered.
NA,The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients.
NA,In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.
NA,In the present study, I propose a novel fitting method to describe the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China.
NA,The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively.
NA,For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day.
NA,But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment.
NA,The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>tanh</mml:mo> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic.
NA,Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear.
NA,Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase.
NA,The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial.
NA,In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>tanh</mml:mo> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> could satisfy the aforementioned properties.
NA,By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results.
NA,They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually.
NA,Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.021</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.012</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> </mml:math>  0.195% in the short-term period of infection.
NA,In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection.
NA,Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February.
NA,In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected.
NA,The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained.
NA,A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented.
NA,This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China.
NA,Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties.
NA,Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization.
NA,However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences.
NA,The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus.
NA,This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery.
NA,The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
NA,From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2.
NA,There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years).
NA,All patients had co-morbidities.
NA,The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1).
NA,The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days).
NA,In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
NA,At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.
NA,The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.
NA,Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.
NA,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea.
NA,However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients.
NA,The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain.
NA,Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection.
NA,Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign.
NA,The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases.
NA,Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection.
NA,No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.
NA,Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination.
NA,Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.
NA,In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.
NA,In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
NA,Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.
NA,Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.
NA,As of April 16, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (called COVID-19) spread to more than 185 countries/regions with more than 142,000 deaths and more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases.
NA,In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms.
NA,However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation.
NA,Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences.
NA,The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).
NA,We report a patient who presented with respiratory failure, chest pain, and fever.
NA,In the COVID-19 pandemic era, the focus was diverted to the coronavirus infection, and STEMI was missed.
NA,Even though we need to be vigilant in the diagnosis of COVID-19, we should not forget about the common pathologies.
NA,To illustrate the [18F]FDG-PET/CT findings in patients affected by cancer with clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients who showed pulmonary involvement unrelated to cancer metastases on March 13 and 16 2020.
NA,We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information.
NA,Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection.
NA,Peripheral lung consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities in two or more lobes were found.
NA,Lung abnormalities displayed increased [18F]FDG uptake (SUVmax 4.3-11.3).
NA,All the patients on the day of PET/CT acquisition were asymptomatic, and they did not have fever or cough.
NA,In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated.
NA,At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms.
NA,The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management.
NA,Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.
NA,Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,This study aims to stratify face shield needs when performing head and neck cancer surgery.
NA,Fifteen patients underwent surgery between March 1, 2020 and April 9, 2020.
NA,Operative diagnosis and procedure; droplet count and distribution on face shields were documented.
NA,Forty-five surgical procedures were performed for neck nodal metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3); carcinoma of tonsil (n = 2), tongue (n = 2), nasopharynx (n = 3), maxilla (n = 1), and laryngopharynx (n = 4).
NA,Droplet contamination was 57.8%, 59.5%, 8.0%, and 0% for operating, first and second assistant surgeons, and scrub nurse respectively.
NA,Droplet count was highest and most widespread during osteotomies.
NA,No droplet splash was noted for transoral robotic surgery.
NA,Face shield is not a mandatory adjunctive PPE for all head and neck surgical procedures and health care providers.
NA,Judicious use helps to conserve resources during such difficult times.
NA,The first European case series are detecting a very high frequency of chemosensitive disorders in COVID-19 patients, ranging between 19.4% and 88%.
NA,Olfactory and gustatory function was objectively tested in 72 COVID-19 patients treated at University Hospital of Sassari.
NA,Overall, 73.6% of the patients reported having or having had chemosensitive disorders.
NA,Olfactory assessment showed variable degree hyposmia in 60 cases and anosmia in two patients.
NA,Gustatory assessment revealed hypogeusia in 33 cases and complete ageusia in one patient.
NA,Statistically significant differences in chemosensitive recovery were detected based on age and distance from the onset of clinical manifestations.
NA,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions represent common clinical findings in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Otolaryngologists and head-neck surgeons must by now keep this diagnostic option in mind when evaluating cases of ageusia and nonspecific anosmia that arose suddenly and are not associated with rhinitis symptoms.
NA,Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is important for decision making prior to surgery in otolaryngology.
NA,An understanding of current and developing testing methods is important for interpreting test results.
NA,We performed a literature review of current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing highlighting its utility, limitations, and implications for otolaryngologists.
NA,The currently accepted RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 has varying sensitivity according to which subsite of the aerodigestive tract is sampled.
NA,Nasal swab sensitivities appear to be about 70%.
NA,Chest CT imaging for screening purposes is not currently recommended.
NA,Due to the current sensitivity of RT-PCR based testing for SARS-CoV-2, a negative test cannot rule out COVID-19.
NA,Full PPE should be worn during high-risk procedures such as aerosol generating procedures even if testing is negative.
NA,Patients who test positive during screening should have their surgeries postponed if possible until asymptomatic and have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of international concern.
NA,This was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and since then has become widespread globally.
NA,We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms).
NA,This is to our knowledge the longest duration of viral shedding reported to date.
NA,This case demonstrates that viral shedding after COVID-19 diagnosis can be prolonged.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 outbreak as a world pandemic on 12th March 2020.
NA,Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples.
NA,Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course.
NA,We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19.
NA,A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed.
NA,Only preliminary data are available currently.
NA,From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines.
NA,All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples.
NA,The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%.
NA,Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed.
NA,There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring.
NA,More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway.
NA,The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests.
NA,To review the present literature on upper respiratory tract sampling in COVID-19 and provide recommendations to improve healthcare practices and directions in future studies.
NA,Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar.
NA,The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2.
NA,Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors.
NA,The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed.
NA,The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled.
NA,Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness.
NA,Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab.
NA,Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield.
NA,Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others.
NA,As an aerosol-generating procedure, traditional pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy techniques must be adapted in order to reduce the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,To describe a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for use in the COVID-19 era and present a case series of patients for whom the technique has been used.
NA,Observational case series of pediatric patients undergoing emergency or urgent airway procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology department in Australia.
NA,Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days.
NA,Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions.
NA,The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures).
NA,The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female.
NA,Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties.
NA,No adverse events occurred.
NA,In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated.
NA,By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.
NA,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
NA,Since then, COVID-19 has become a pandemic affecting more than 1.5 million people worldwide.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 have a wide spectrum of manifestations, one being cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and its fatal correlate, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH).
NA,Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking.
NA,We report two cases of patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated by CRS and were treated with tocilizumab.
NA,Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
NA,These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant issue for global health, economics and society.
NA,A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice.
NA,Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.
NA,We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects.
NA,We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.
NA,The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density.
NA,However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians.
NA,For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.
NA,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has a tremendous impact on global health and the daily life of people still living in more than two hundred countries.
NA,The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients.
NA,Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation.
NA,In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis.
NA,Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19.
NA,On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays.
NA,A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures.
NA,In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies.
NA,The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive.
NA,Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.
NA,The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-Cov-2 or COVID-19 has become a worldwide threat and the major healthcare concern of the year 2020.
NA,Cancer research was directly affected by the emerging of this disease.
NA,According to some Chinese studies, cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications.
NA,This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations.
NA,Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population.
NA,In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population.
NA,Finally, we focus on strategies that are followed in cancer management with review of national and international guidelines.
NA,COVID 19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has created surge demand for essential healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for advance information technologies applications.
NA,Industry 4.0 is known as the fourth industrial revolution, which has the potential to fulfil customised requirement during COVID-19 crisis.
NA,This revolution has started with the applications of advance manufacturing and digital information technologies.
NA,A detailed review of the literature is done on the technologies of Industry 4.0 and their applications in the COVID-19 pandemic, using appropriate search words on the databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate.
NA,We found several useful technologies of Industry 4.0 which help for proper control and management of COVID-19 pandemic and these have been discussed in this paper.
NA,The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other related problems and symptoms.
NA,Industry 4.0 can fulfil the requirements of customised face masks, gloves, and collect information for healthcare systems for proper controlling and treating of COVID-19 patients.
NA,We have discussed ten major technologies of Industry 4.0 which help to solve the problems of this virus.
NA,It is useful to provide day to day update of an infected patient, area-wise, age-wise and state-wise with proper surveillance systems.
NA,We also believe that the proper implementation of these technologies would help to enhance education and communication regarding public health.
NA,These Industry 4.0 technologies could provide a lot of innovative ideas and solution for fighting local and global medical emergencies.
NA,Preparations of health systems to accommodate large number of severely ill COVID-19 patients in March/April 2020 has a significant impact on nuclear medicine departments.
NA,A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively.
NA,Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations.
NA,The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020.  113 complete responses were recorded.
NA,Nearly all participants (97 %) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures.
NA,The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively.
NA,Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment.
NA,Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale.
NA,We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system.
NA,As the survey cannot adapt to daily dynamic changes in priorities, it serves as a first snapshot requiring follow-up studies and comparisons with other countries and regions.
NA,Die Vorbereitungen der Gesundheitssysteme auf die Aufnahme einer großen Zahl schwerkranker COVID-19-Patienten im März/April 2020 haben erhebliche Auswirkungen auf nuklearmedizinische Abteilungen und Praxen, deren Ausmaß unbekannt ist.
NA,Ziel dieser Online-Umfrage ist es, den aktuellen Status der nuklearmedizinischen Abteilungen in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz zu erfassen.
NA,Ein webbasierter Fragebogen wurde entwickelt, um die Auswirkungen der Pandemie auf stationäre und ambulante nuklearmedizinische Abteilungen zu erfassen.
NA,Die Fragen bezogen sich auf die folgenden Themen: Merkmale der nuklearmedizinischen Abteilung, Auswirkungen auf die nuklearmedizinische Diagnostik und Therapie, Anwendung von Empfehlungen, persönliche Schutzausrüstung (PSA) und organisatorische Anpassungen an die neuen Rahmenbedingungen.
NA,Die Umfrage war 6 Tage lang verfügbar und wurde am 20.
NA,April 2020 geschlossen.  113 vollständige Antworten wurden erfasst und ausgewertet.
NA,Nahezu alle Teilnehmer (97 %) berichten über einen Rückgang der nuklearmedizinischen Diagnostik.
NA,Die durchschnittliche Abnahme in den letzten drei Wochen für PET/CT, Szintigraphien von Knochen, Myokard, Lunge, Schilddrüse, Sentinel-Lymphknoten beträgt –14,4 %, –47,5 %, –40,7 %, –58,4 % beziehungsweise –25,2 %. 76 % der Teilnehmer berichten über einen Rückgang der Therapien.
NA,Hiervon betroffen sind insbesondere die Radiojodtherapie von gutartigen Schilddrüsenerkrankungen (–41,8 %) und die Radiosynoviorthese (–53,8 %), während die Tumortherapien weitgehend stabil blieben. 48 % der Teilnehmer berichten über einen Mangel an persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.
NA,Organisatorische Anpassungen wie Kurzarbeit und Versetzung von Mitarbeitern wurden in 36 % beziehungsweise 19 % berichtet.
NA,Die nuklearmedizinischen Leistungen sind 3 Wochen, nachdem die Pandemie SARS-CoV-2 Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz in großem Umfang erreicht hat, deutlich reduziert.
NA,Wir müssen uns bewusst sein, dass die gegenwärtige Krise auch erhebliche wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen auf das Gesundheitssystem haben wird, sowohl in Krankenhäusern als auch in Praxen.
NA,Da sich die Umfrage nicht an die täglichen dynamischen Veränderungen der Prioritäten anpassen kann, dient sie als eine erste Momentaufnahme, die Folgestudien und Vergleiche mit anderen Ländern und Regionen erfordert.
NA,Testing for the presence of coronavirus is an essential diagnostic tool for monitoring and managing the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The only reliable test in current use for testing acute infection targets the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and the most widely used method is quantitative fluorescence-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
NA,Despite its ubiquity, there is a significant amount of uncertainty about how this test works, potential throughput and reliability.
NA,This has resulted in widespread misrepresentation of the problems faced using this test during the current COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,This primer provides simple, straightforward and impartial information about RT-qPCR.
NA,Since December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has expanded to cause a worldwide outbreak that more than 600,000 people infected and tens of thousands died.
NA,To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province in China have not been described.
NA,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital.
NA,Of the 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 30 cases (33.0%) were severe and two patients (2.2%) died.
NA,The severe disease group tended to be older (50.5 vs.
NA,42.0 years; p = 0.049) and have more chronic disease (40% vs.
NA,14.8%; p = 0.009) relative to mild disease group.
NA,Only 73.6% of the patients were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive on their first tests, while typical chest computed tomography images were obtained for each patient.
NA,The most common complaints were cough (n = 75; 82.4%), fever (n = 59; 64.8%), fatigue (n = 35; 38.5%), and diarrhea (n = 14; 15.4%).
NA,Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests.
NA,Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients.
NA,Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan.
NA,Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems.
NA,Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).
NA,The knowledge about the virus is still limited, but as the pandemic progresses and the physiopathology of the disease is understood, new evidence is being massively published.
NA,Surgical specialists are facing an unprecedented situation: they must collaborate in the ER or medical wards attending these patients, while still needing to make decisions about surgical patients with probable COVID-19.
NA,The present narrative review aims to summarize the most relevant aspects and synthetize concepts on COVID-19 for surgeons.
NA,The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a challenge for neurologists caring for patients with preexisting neurologic conditions hospitalized for COVID-19 or for evaluation of patients who have neurologic complications during COVID-19 infection.
NA,We conducted a scoping review of the available literature on COVID-19 to assess the potential effect on neurologists in terms of prevalent comorbidities and incidence of new neurologic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
NA,We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Scopus databases for adult patients with preexisting neurologic disease who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19 or reported incidence of secondary neurologic events following diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined.
NA,Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness.
NA,Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20%, and 36.4%, respectively).
NA,Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes.
NA,Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness.
NA,Neurologists need to be prepared to reorganize their consultative practices to serve the neurologic needs of patients during this pandemic.
NA,This paper provides an early evaluation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) against COVID-19.
NA,The main areas where AI can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 are discussed.
NA,It is concluded that AI has not yet been impactful against COVID-19.
NA,Its use is hampered by a lack of data, and by too much data.
NA,Overcoming these constraints will require a careful balance between data privacy and public health, and rigorous human-AI interaction.
NA,It is unlikely that these will be addressed in time to be of much help during the present pandemic.
NA,In the meantime, extensive gathering of diagnostic data on who is infectious will be essential to save lives, train AI, and limit economic damages.
NA,Across much of the world, cancer care has been sidelined to a variable degree by the global effort against the coronavirus pandemic.
NA,This paper discusses the impact of coronavirus infection on cancer diagnosis and treatment in two leading cancer centres in Pakistan.
NA,It also describes the effect that preparations for the expected surge in cases in Pakistan over the next few weeks have had on cancer care.
NA,There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of delays in diagnosis and treatment on cancer stage and treatment, and to decide how to minimise these during likely future cycles of lockdown over the coming months and years.
NA,Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country.
NA,Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection.
NA,The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough.
NA,Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count.
NA,While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited.
NA,The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low.
NA,There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination.
NA,This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
NA,In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, computed tomography (CT) examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a large-scale study.
NA,Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care.
NA,To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19.
NA,We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT.
NA,Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT.
NA,Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature.
NA,We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories.
NA,Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19.
NA,The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,• Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,• Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care.
NA,• The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic will result in substantial neurological disease, whether through direct infection (rare), para-infectious complications (less rare), or critical illness more generally (common).
NA,Here, we raise the importance of stringent diagnosis and data collection regarding neurological complications of COVID-19; we urge caution in the over-diagnosis of neurological disease where it does not exist, but equally strongly encourage the concerted surveillance for such conditions.
NA,Additional to the direct neurological complications of COVID-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
NA,We therefore also outline the specific management of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases in the context of the pandemic.
NA,This article describes the implications of COVID-19 on neurological disease and advertises the Neurocritical Care Society's international data collection collaborative that seeks to align data elements.
NA,Few studies reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course.
NA,We investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 without any symptoms.
NA,Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively recruited.
NA,The demographic characteristics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without any symptoms were analyzed.
NA,Fifteen (4.4%) of 342 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients did not develop any symptom during the course of the disease.
NA,The median time from exposure to diagnosis was 7.0 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.0-15.0 days).
NA,Of the 15 patients, 14 patients were diagnosed by tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, while one patient was only tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in anal swabs.
NA,During hospitalization, only 1 (6.7%) patient developed lymphopenia.
NA,Abnormalities of chest computed tomography examinations were detected in 8 (53.4%) patients on admission.
NA,As of 8 March 2020, all patients have been discharged.
NA,The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR: 4.0-9.0 days).
NA,Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.
NA,Asymptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have favorable outcomes.
NA,The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as named by the World Health Organization has millions of confirmed cases around the world and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.
NA,The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
NA,COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia.
NA,In a small subset of severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death.
NA,Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of COVID-19.
NA,Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design.
NA,Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.
NA,Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.
NA,2019 新型冠状病毒的暴发持续至今，导致了世界各地数以百万计的感染个例，更夺去了数十万人的生命。
NA,世界卫生组织在2020 年2 月将此病毒引起的疾病定名为2019 冠状病毒病 (Coronavirus disease 2019，COVID-19)，而国际病毒分类委员会也将此病毒命名为SARS-CoV-2。
NA,COVID-19 的典型临床症状类似感冒，少数病人可发展为重症甚至死亡。
NA,21 世纪以来，人类冠状病毒有3 次大暴发，分别是2003 年暴发的严重急性呼吸综合征(SARS)、2012 年暴发的中东呼吸综合征 (MERS) 和本次的新型肺炎。
NA,自2003 年以来，对SARS 和MERS 冠状病毒的研究从未间断，对其自然起源、致病机理、药物筛选及疫苗研发等已取得一定进展。
NA,鉴于SARS-CoV-2 和SARS-CoV的基因组序列高度相似，以往对SARS-CoV 的研究对深入探讨SARS-CoV-2 生物学特性、诊断、治疗和防控有很强的借鉴性。
NA,文中通过回顾过往的研究进展，对比SARS-CoV 和SARS-CoV-2 的生物学特性，分析当前亟需的防控和诊疗措施，探讨疫苗研发所面对的一些难题，并展望疫情发展趋势及对本领域研究与开发的主要挑战，冀为我国和全世界有效控制COVID-19 疫情提供参考。.
NA,We optimized a fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay system for rapid and real time detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,The results show that the lowest dilution of RNA samples used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA could reach 1/10 000 (the initial value is set as 10 ng/μL).
NA,Moreover, the cycle threshold (Ct) for samples of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 was lower than 35 or 40.
NA,The sensitivity of this method was satisfactory.
NA,The results were consistent with those of the COVID-19 detection kit on the market under the same conditions, but the number of cycles required was shortened by about 2.
NA,Therefore, the optimized assay developed in this study can be used in screening and early clinical diagnosis.
NA,Our work provides a tool to facilitate rapid clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,为实时并快速地检出SARS-CoV-2 冠状病毒RNA，对基于荧光定量聚合酶链式反应 (Polymerase chain reaction，PCR) 的反应体系进行了优化。
NA,结果表明，按照本实验提供的方法操作后，检测SARS-CoV-2 冠状病毒所用的RNA 样本的最小浓度稀释度可调至1/10 000 (初始值设为10 ng/μL)。
NA,且用于检测COVID-19 临床阳性样本所测得循环值 (Cycle threshold，Ct) 均低于35 或40。
NA,其灵敏性测试结果也表明该方法的敏感性较好。
NA,同时在同等条件下，与目前市场上的COVID-19 试剂盒的检测结果基本一致，并且检测循环数缩短2 个单位。
NA,因此，本实验所建立的体系适用于前期临床诊断的筛查工作，为在医学上实现快速诊断提供了工具。.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic during the first months of 2020 is causing profound changes in worldwide health care systems, resulting in a major reduction of surgical interventions and routine non-urgent outpatient diagnostic procedures.
NA,The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
NA,The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
NA,In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
NA,Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
NA,Healthcare workers (n = 803) with mild symptoms were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 90 positive) and asked to complete a symptom questionnaire.
NA,Anosmia, muscle ache, ocular pain, general malaise, headache, extreme tiredness and fever were associated with positivity.
NA,A predictive model based on these symptoms showed moderate discriminative value (sensitivity: 91.2%; specificity: 55.6%).
NA,While our models would not justify presumptive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis without molecular confirmation, it can contribute to targeted screening strategies.
NA,Coronavirus disease, first emerged in Wuhan, rapidly spread all over the world since December 2019.
NA,There are concerns about elective dermatology appointments and its results.
NA,Herein, we aimed to find out which type of dermatologic patients attended to dermatology outpatient clinic.
NA,The patients visiting the clinics for elective dermatologic diseases between March 11 and 18, 2020, were included in this study.
NA,Their age, sex, diagnosis of disease, requirement for emergent intervention, and their medical records about COVID-19 were obtained.
NA,There were 390 patients attending to the dermatology outpatient clinic in this period.
NA,The most common disease was acne (N: 94, 24%), only 19% of patients need emergent interventions or dose adjustment.
NA,There were 40 (10%) patients over the age of 65.
NA,After their visits, five patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 in 2weeks.
NA,Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission since being closed to the patient.
NA,Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital.
NA,Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of our patients were not screened for COVID-19.
NA,Our findings support the concerns of elective physician examinations.
NA,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, planned medical and surgical activities are being postponed.
NA,For the dermatology community, this interruption to the healthcare system can lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.
NA,Neglecting melanoma during this crisis can result in increased mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs.
NA,With the COVID-19 pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, it is time for the prospective evaluation of teledermatology.
NA,However, dermatologists should be cautious and continue seeing patients with pigmented lesions in person due to the necessity of early surgical intervention.
NA,In the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) had the second highest number of cases globally yet was able to dramatically lower the incidence of new cases and sustain a low mortality rate, making it a promising example of strong national response.
NA,We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19.
NA,Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care.
NA,Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
NA,Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
NA,Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
NA,South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
NA,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, important elective procedures, such as screening colonoscopy, have been delayed or cancelled, and there may be a very long waitlist for rescheduling once the moratorium is lifted.
NA,However, DNA-based stool sample tests may be useful for colorectal cancer screening when colonoscopy is not available.
NA,The aim of this review is to demonstrate the potential utility of enhanced DNA-based stool testing for colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis during crises that strain available healthcare resources, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This review shows that DNA-based stool sample tests have the potential to enable colorectal cancer screening to prioritize patients to elective colonoscopy procedures, the continued delay of which during the COVID-19 pandemic has already placed a burden on future elective procedures.
NA,We report 3 patients with coronavirus disease who had a decline in respiratory status during their hospital course that responded well to intravenous steroids and interleukin-6 receptor antagonist therapy.
NA,These patients later showed development of persistent hypoxia with increased levels of d-dimer levels and were given a diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms.
NA,Heart-fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) has been recognized as a highly heart-specific marker.
NA,However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19.
NA,We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks.
NA,They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay.
NA,We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features.
NA,We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19.
NA,Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP&gt; 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization.
NA,The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23-8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP&gt; 7 ng/mL.
NA,These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19.
NA,But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.
NA,Our study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the registration number: ChiCTR2000029829.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to 185 countries with over 2.1 million confirmed cases and 145,000 deaths, as per the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard provided at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.
NA,Imaging modalities such as chest radiography, thoracic and cardiovascular ultrasound, and computed tomography have roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and therapy of COVID-19.
NA,However, the potential benefits of imaging need to be balanced against resource utilization and infectious risk.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic.
NA,The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals.
NA,Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19.
NA,We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'.
NA,We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments.
NA,We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces.
NA,Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination.
NA,Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments.
NA,The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues.
NA,Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
NA,Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up.
NA,To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19.
NA,The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy.
NA,In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate.
NA,Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.
NA,The rapid surge and wide-spread of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) overshadows the entire medical industries worldwide.
NA,The stringent medical resources hinder the diagnostic capacity globally, while 84 thousands of new cases confirmed within a single day of 14 April 2020.
NA,Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with is the current first-line diagnosis, but the false-negative rate remains concerned.
NA,Radiographic technologies and tools, including Computed tomography (CT) and Chest X-ray (CXR), were applied for initial screening and follow-up, from which provides detail diagnosis with specific pathologic features for staging and treatment arrangement.
NA,Although the radiographic imaging is found less sensitive, numerous CT-positive patients were not screened out by RT-PCR initially and later confirmed as COVID-19 positive.
NA,Besides, the shortage of sampling kits and the longer turn-over time of PCR examinations in some areas were noticed due to logistic issues and healthcare burden.
NA,In this review, we will discuss the challenges and the future perspectives of using radiographic modalities for COVID-19 diagnosis in view of securing human lives amid the crisis.
NA,The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been causing respiratory diseases globally, damaging wide-ranges of social-economical activities.
NA,This virus is transmitted through personal contact and possibly also through ambient air.
NA,Effective biosensor platforms for the detection of this virus and the related host response are in urgent demand.
NA,These platforms can facilitate routine diagnostic assays in certified clinical labs.
NA,They can also be integrated into point-of-care products.
NA,Furthermore, environmental biosensors can be designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the ambient air or in the intensive care ventilators.
NA,Here, we evaluate technical components of biosensors, including the biological targets of recognition, the recognition methods and the signal amplification and transduction systems.
NA,Effective SARS-CoV-2 detectors can be designed by adequate combination of these technologies.
NA,The great majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response.
NA,To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples<sup>1-3</sup> while simultaneously testing for many pathogens<sup>4-6</sup>.
NA,Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection.
NA,In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents<sup>7</sup> self-organize in a microwell array<sup>8</sup> to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate.
NA,The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array.
NA,Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations.
NA,The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold.
NA,Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health<sup>9-11</sup>.
NA,Non-invasive remote health monitoring plays a vital role in epidemiological situations such as SARS outbreak (2003), MERS (2015) and the recently ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 because it is extremely risky to get close to the patient due to the spread of contagious infections.
NA,Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes.
NA,Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications.
NA,IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution.
NA,The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating.
NA,This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate's health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging.
NA,Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.
NA,In these unprecedented times, OMFS surgeons are faced with dilemmas over the priority of treatment, safety of staff, safety of patients and the most appropriate use of available resources.
NA,Efforts should be made to provide the best evidence-based care, which will mean revisiting old techniques, and risk stratifying patients on a case by case basis.
NA,Recent experience from colleagues internationally has shown that even the wealthiest health care infrastructure is at best fragile.
NA,We hope this paper will add to the debate and hopefully provide a framework for decision making in OMFS trauma care during this difficult time.
NA,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) brought with it rapid development of both molecular and serologic assays for identification of COVID-19 infections.
NA,While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays.
NA,The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning, given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen and the acceptable specimen types.
NA,An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate, or perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate.
NA,Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role in during our global response to this pandemic.
NA,Multiple laboratory developed tests and commercially available assays have emerged to meet diagnostic needs related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,To date, there is limited comparison data for these different testing platforms.
NA,We compared the analytical performance of a laboratory developed test (LDT) developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens.
NA,The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay.
NA,All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.
NA,Our results provide initial test performance characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a public health emergency.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 is currently spreading rapidly and globally.
NA,We recently reported a laboratory diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time RT-PCR assays using two primer sets, N and N2.
NA,On 30-31 January 2020, the protocol and reagents for these assays were distributed to local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan, and nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was started.
NA,For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and the clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals.
NA,The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&amp;W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens.
NA,While the LM S&amp;W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.
NA,Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
NA,These indicate that the protocol using the N and N2 sets is comparable to commercially available kits and is reliable for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,We report acute antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 285 patients with COVID-19.
NA,Within 19 days after symptom onset, 100% of patients tested positive for antiviral immunoglobulin-G (IgG).
NA,Seroconversion for IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially.
NA,Both IgG and IgM titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion.
NA,Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic started in Italy in February 2020 with an exponential growth that has exceeded the number of cases reported in China.
NA,Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up.
NA,In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool.
NA,SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients.
NA,In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients.
NA,(1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test.
NA,(2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
NA,(3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.
NA,The current global outbreak of COVID-19 represents a major challenge in terms of epidemiology, contagiousness, treatment, as well as clinical and radiological behavior of this disease.
NA,Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms.
NA,According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays.
NA,In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation.
NA,Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement.
NA,Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.
NA,To study vaginal delivery outcomes and neonatal prognosis and summarize the management of vaginal delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,A retrospective analysis of medical records and comparison of vaginal delivery outcomes between 10 pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and 53 pregnant women without COVID-19 admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 20 and March 2, 2020.
NA,Results of laboratory tests, imaging tests, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were also analyzed in neonates delivered by pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,There were no significant differences in gestational age, postpartum hemorrhage, and perineal resection rates between the two groups.
NA,There were no significant differences in birth weight of neonates and neonatal asphyxia rates between the two groups.
NA,Neonates delivered by pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Under the premise of full evaluation of vaginal delivery conditions and strict protection measures, pregnant women with ordinary type COVID-19 can try vaginal delivery without exacerbation of COVID-19 and without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
NA,As of 19 February 2020, there had been 333 confirmed cases reported in Shanghai, China.
NA,This study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with COVID-19 in Shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference.
NA,Among the 333 confirmed cases in Shanghai, 172 (51.7%) were males and 161 (48.3%) were females, with a median age of 50 years.
NA,299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms.
NA,139 (41.7%) and 111 (33.3%) cases were infected in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively.
NA,148 (44.4%) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset, while 103 (30.9%) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in Wuhan.
NA,The onset date of the first case in Shanghai was 28 December, with the peak appearing on 27 January.
NA,The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 7.2 days.
NA,207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization.
NA,56 (18.6%) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 (42.9%) had increased C-reactive protein after onset.
NA,Elderly, male and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia.
NA,These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia.
NA,Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia.
NA,Time intervals from onset to visit, hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response.
NA,Shanghai's experience proves that COVID-19 can be controlled well in megacities.
NA,COVID-19 infection, a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV virus, and the World Health Organization declared this increasingly spreading disease as a global public health emergency (pandemic).
NA,In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as the reference standard test.
NA,In the early stages, thorax CT findings could be present even before the onset of symptoms, thorax CT has quite high sensitivity in COVID-19 patients with false negative RT-PCR results, and it has a great importance not only in diagnosis but also in follow up (6,7).
NA,We think that it might be beneficial for our radiologist colleagues in the early diagnosis of the imaging features of this disease, by sharing the experiences we have gained by evaluating the typical and relatively atypical CT findings regarding the natural course of the tomographic findings of COVID-19 and when to control CT.
NA,Given the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus and the lack of proven specific therapeutic drugs and licensed vaccines effective against it, early diagnosis of the disease is of paramount importance.
NA,The common chest CT imaging of confirmed COVID-19 cases is discussed here, which shows ground-glass opacity, crazy paving, and consolidation.
NA,After an outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCov), now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a wide spectrum of illness and patients with underlying comorbidities have a high mortality.
NA,Here we present a 49-year-old male patient with comorbid conditions who presented with fever, cough, myalgia and shortness of breath for five days with likely exposure to a COVID-19 contact.
NA,A computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed multifocal bilateral ground-glass lung opacities with areas of subpleural sparing.
NA,He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification.
NA,Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started, and the patient responded favorably with improvement of symptoms.
NA,Early diagnosis and self-isolation or quarantine remain key to stemming the tide of the contagion as there is a real risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed.
NA,The clinical presentation of European patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection is still unknown.
NA,To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe.
NA,Patients with positive diagnosis of Covid-19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals.
NA,Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire.
NA,Bayesian analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between outcomes. 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of health care workers).
NA,The mean age of patients was 39.17±12.09 years.
NA,The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%).
NA,Fever was reported by on 45.4%.
NA,The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5±5.7 days.
NA,The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex.
NA,Young patients more frequently had ear, nose, and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite.
NA,Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients.
NA,The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea.
NA,Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients.
NA,The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients.
NA,Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.
NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Because CT plays an important role in diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and effective evaluation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infection prevention and control management of CT examination rooms is important. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.
NA,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a global pandemic.
NA,Our goal was to determine whether coinfections with other respiratory pathogens occur in a significant subset of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the greater New York City metropolitan area.
NA,During the period from March 16, 2020 through April 20, 2020, our laboratory detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in 8,990 patients of a total 18,704 tested by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction amplification (SARS-CoV-2 Test, cobas® 6800 system, RocheDiagnostics).
NA,Amongst the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 1,204 were also tested for other respiratory viruses, and concurrent infection was found in only 36 (&lt; 3%).
NA,In comparison, coinfection with at least one non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral pathogen was found in 13.1% of patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Additionally, in patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the most common respiratory virus co-infections were those commonly seen circulating in the community including rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza viruses and coronavirus NL63, whereas non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviridae were the most common concurrent respiratory viruses found in SARS-CoV-2 -positive patients.
NA,Additional studies are needed to establish whether simultaneous viral infection in SARS-CoV-2 patients could potential drive viral interference or influence disease outcomes.

NA,The world is facing an unprecedented global pandemic in the form of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has ravaged all aspects of life, especially health systems.
NA,Radiology services, in particular, are under threat of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients affected, unless drastic efforts are taken to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus.
NA,Proactive measures, therefore, must be taken to ensure the continuation of diagnostic and interventional support to clinicians, while minimizing the risk of nosocomial transmission among staff and other patients.
NA,This article aims to highlight several strategies to improve preparedness, readiness and response towards this pandemic, specific to the radiology department.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a worldwide outbreak with several millions of people infected and more than 160.000 deaths.
NA,A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients.
NA,Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients.
NA,Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates.
NA,Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm.
NA,This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.
NA,BACKGROUNDThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a novel viral pneumonia (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world.
NA,The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear.METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis in 5630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates.RESULTSThe overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1952/5630).
NA,Male (P = 0.025) and older populations (P = 2.525 × 10-39) were at significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30-79 years.
NA,Furthermore, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the amount of testing in 501 subjects.
NA,Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 35.5%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847 × 10-9) and a 1.43-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 39.9%) from testing once to 3 times (P = 7.797 × 10-14).
NA,More than 3 testing administrations was not helpful for further improvement.
NA,However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097).
NA,CONCLUSIONAll populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk.
NA,Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia.
NA,It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible.FUNDINGThis work was supported by National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (no.
NA,2017ZX10103005-007) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (no.
NA,2018YFE0204500).
NA,To compare the severity of psychological distress between patients with epilepsy and healthy controls during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China, as well as identify potential risk factors of severe psychological distress among patients with epilepsy.
NA,This cross-sectional case-control study examined a consecutive sample of patients older than 15 years treated at the epilepsy center of West China Hospital between February 1 and February 29, 2020.
NA,As controls, sex- and age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients (unrelated to the patients) were also enrolled during the same period.
NA,Data on demographics and attention paid to COVID-19 were collected by online questionnaire, data on epilepsy features were collected from electronic medical records, and psychological distress was evaluated using the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-6).
NA,Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using multivariate logistic regression.
NA,The 252 patients and 252 controls in this study were similar along all demographic variables except family income.
NA,Patients with epilepsy showed significantly higher K-6 scores than healthy controls and spent significantly more time following the COVID-19 outbreak (both P &lt; .001).
NA,Univariate analyses associated both diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy and time spent paying attention to COVID-19 with severe psychological distress (defined as K-6 score &gt;12; both P ≤ .001).
NA,Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent predictors of severe psychological distress: time spent paying attention to COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.172, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.073-1.280) and diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.283, 95% CI = 0.128-0.623).
NA,During public health outbreaks, clinicians and caregivers should focus not only on seizure control but also on mental health of patients with epilepsy, especially those with drug-resistant epilepsy.
NA,K-6 scores &gt; 12 indicate severe psychological distress.
NA,This may mean, for example, encouraging patients to engage in other activities instead of excessively following media coverage of the outbreak.
NA,The abrupt outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 and its rapid spread over many healthcare systems throughout the world has led to a shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE), which cannot be solved by reducing their use or by increasing production.
NA,It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy and promoting an effective technique to reuse them.
NA,A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, and from the 25 top cited articles, 15 were selected for relevance and impact.
NA,Most studies on previous respiratory virus epidemics to date suggest surgical masks are not inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among healthcare workers.
NA,Therefore, the use of N95 respirators should be limited to high-risk situations.
NA,Concerning respirator reuse, highly energetic, short-wave, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was determined to decontaminate N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents, but UVGI requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biologic target.
NA,Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help in the shortage of PPE during a pandemic.
NA,Further studies testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need.
NA,The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning.
NA,These groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE.
NA,This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures.
NA,Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
NA,IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event.
NA,DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics.
NA,The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001).
NA,Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
NA,More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia.
NA,Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures.
NA,Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service.
NA,Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
NA,The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic.
NA,On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic, having recorded her index case in February 2020, with an increasing number of cases every day and a current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April 2020.
NA,Although the recorded cases may seem low, it has been forecast that Africa will have some of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic.
NA,Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern, especially in the event of increased outbreaks.
NA,Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia.
NA,This has grim implications for Nigeria, especially as increased cases loom that may require critical care.
NA,Provision of quarantine or isolation facilities and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease can also be a challenge in Africa.
NA,There is an urgent need to put into perspective these realities peculiar to Africa including Nigeria and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Few data are available on the rate and characteristics of thromboembolic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
NA,We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020-10.04.2020).
NA,The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI).
NA,Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
NA,We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]).
NA,Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward.
NA,Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%-11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward).
NA,Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission.
NA,Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%).
NA,Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA).
NA,The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively.
NA,Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients.
NA,The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.
NA,Numerous nucleic acid amplification assays have recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and there is a need to assess their test performance relative to one another.
NA,The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay targeting two regions of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) to a high complexity molecular-based, laboratory-developed EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene.
NA,We performed a diagnostic comparison study by testing nasopharyngeal samples on the two assays.
NA,Assay agreement was assessed by overall percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient.
NA,A total of 184 nasopharyngeal samples were tested using the two assays, of which 180 showed valid results and were included for the comparative analysis.
NA,Overall percent agreement between the assays was 98.3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 95.2-99.7) and kappa coefficient was 0.97 (95 % CI 0.93-1.0).
NA,One sample was detected on the SHC laboratory developed test (LDT) and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9.
NA,Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6.
NA,The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
NA,Other considerations, including reagent availability, turnaround time, labor requirements, cost and instrument throughput should guide the decision of which assay to perform.
NA,An outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran has spread throughout the country.
NA,Identifying the epidemiological characteristics of this disease will help to make appropriate decisions and thus control the epidemic.
NA,The aim of this study was characterization of the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in Iran.
NA,In this retrospective study, data related to the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 19 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 have been analyzed and reported.
NA,Patient characteristics including age, gender and underlying diseases were investigated.
NA,Data were collected through patient records.
NA,Sex ratio, Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and daily trend of cases were also determined.
NA,A multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed to assess affecting factors on mortality.
NA,From February 19, 2020 to April 15, 2020, 12870 patients referred to the hospital emergency department, of which 2968 were hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,The majority of cases were in the age group of 50 to 60 years of old.
NA,The male-to-female ratio was 1.93:1.
NA,A total of 239 deaths occurred among all cases for an overall CFR of 1.85% based on the total number of patients (both outpatient and inpatient) and 8.06% among hospitalized patients.
NA,Out of all patients 10.89% had comorbidity.
NA,Diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic Kidney diseases and cancer were the most common comorbidities with 3.81, 2.02 , 1.99 , 1.25, 0.60 and 0.57 %, respectively.
NA,Male gender (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.08-1.96), older age (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.04-1.06) and having underlying diseases (OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.24) were significantly associated with mortality.
NA,The results of this study showed that Male gender, older age and having comorbidities were significantly associated with the risk of death among COVID-19 patients.
NA,It is important to pay special attention to male elderly patients with underlying diseases.
NA,Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results.
NA,As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO.
NA,COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker.
NA,Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded.
NA,The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol.
NA,Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns.
NA,Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19.
NA,This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized.
NA,All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection.
NA,During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.
NA,The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.
NA,COVID-19 has brought death and disease to large parts of the world.
NA,Governments must deploy strategies to screen the population and subsequently isolate the suspect cases.
NA,Diagnostic testing is critical for epidemiological surveillance, but the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and clinical utility (impact on health outcomes) of the current diagnostic methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection are not known.
NA,I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis.
NA,After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations.
NA,I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in.
NA,This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases.
NA,COVID-19 ha traído muerte y enfermedad a gran parte del mundo.
NA,Los gobiernos deben desplegar estrategias para tamizar la población y aislar los casos sospechosos.
NA,Las pruebas diagnósticas son críticas en la vigilancia epidemiológica, pero no se conoce la exactitud (sensibilidad y especificidad) y la utilidad clínica (impacto sobre los desenlaces de salud) de los métodos diagnósticos actuales usados para la detección del SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Realicé una búsqueda rápida en PubMed/MEDLINE para encontrar estudios sobre las pruebas diagnósticas de laboratorio y de diagnóstico viral rápido.
NA,Después de correr las estrategias de búsqueda, encontré 47 artículos elegibles que son los que uso para esta revisión, en que comento las características de las pruebas y sus limitaciones.
NA,No encontré artículos que aborden la utilidad clínica de las pruebas actualmente usadas para la detección del COVID-19, lo que implica que estamos librando una batalla sin tener un conocimiento adecuado de cuál es la proporción de falsos negativos que resultan de los tests que hoy se aplican.
NA,No debemos ignorar esta dificultad, dado que podría obstaculizar los esfuerzos nacionales para contener la pandemia con arreglo a la aplicación de test diagnósticos a los casos sospechosos comunitarios.
NA,Global health is facing the most dangerous situation regarding the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome called coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is widely known as the abbreviated COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This is due to the highly infectious nature of the disease and its possibility to cause pneumonia induced death in approximately 6.89% of infected individuals (data until 27 April 2020).
NA,The pathogen causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to be originated from the Wuhan Province in China.
NA,Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile.
NA,This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs.
NA,The applications of nanochemistry and general nanotechnology was also discussed to give the status of nanodiagnostic systems for COVID-19.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China since Dec 2019 and cases of infection have been continuously reported in various countries.
NA,It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human.
NA,Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness.
NA,We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation.
NA,The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages.
NA,Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes.
NA,We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration.
NA,The patient was cured and discharged.
NA,This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.
NA,In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers.
NA,In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory.
NA,Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient.
NA,A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization.
NA,NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19.
NA,A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website.
NA,Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website.
NA,In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement.
NA,The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD.
NA,In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis.
NA,Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.
NA,COVID-19 has rapidly become a major health emergency worldwide.
NA,Patients with IBD are at increased risk of infection, especially when they have active disease and are taking immunosuppressive therapy.
NA,The characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD remain unclear.
NA,This Italian prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with an established IBD diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death).
NA,Between 11 and 29 March 2020, 79 patients with IBD with COVID-19 were enrolled at 24 IBD referral units.
NA,Thirty-six patients had COVID-19-related pneumonia (46%), 22 (28%) were hospitalised, 7 (9%) required non-mechanical ventilation, 9 (11%) required continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 2 (3%) had endotracheal intubation and 6 (8%) died.
NA,Four patients (6%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 while they were being hospitalised for a severe flare of IBD.
NA,Age over 65 years (p=0.03), UC diagnosis (p=0.03), IBD activity (p=0.003) and a CCI score &gt;1 (p=0.04) were significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas concomitant IBD treatments were not.
NA,Age over 65 years (p=0.002), active IBD (p=0.02) and higher CCI score were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death.
NA,Active IBD, old age and comorbidities were associated with a negative COVID-19 outcome, whereas IBD treatments were not.
NA,Preventing acute IBD flares may avoid fatal COVID-19 in patients with IBD.
NA,Further research is needed.
NA,Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
NA,At present, diagnosis COVID-19 were based on real-time RT-PCR, which have to be performed in biosafe laboratory and is unsatisfactory for suspect case screening.
NA,Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19.
NA,To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body detection in suspected COVID-19 cases.
NA,In the prospective cohort, 150 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang province, China, between January 20 to February 2, 2020.
NA,All patients were tested by the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for COVID-19.
NA,At least two samples of each patient were collected for RT-PCR assay analysis, and the PCR results were performed as the reference standard of diagnosis.
NA,Meanwhile 26 heathy blood donor were recruited.
NA,The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated.
NA,Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity.
NA,The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993].
NA,In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result.
NA,In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970].
NA,The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19.
NA,Further investigations should be done to evaluate this assay in variety of clinical settings and populations.
NA,Recently, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards.
NA,With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
NA,Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.
NA,Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
NA,The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many healthcare organizations to divert efforts and resources to emergent patient care, delaying many elective oncological surgeries.
NA,We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome.
NA,This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016.
NA,Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months.
NA,Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP.
NA,We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP.
NA,After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months.
NA,Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes.
NA,In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP.
NA,These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.
NA,The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic has become the biggest challenge for the whole human community since many years.
NA,It seems that the proper identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is the best strategy to limit the transmission.
NA,However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, and symptoms may be very mild or atypical.
NA,There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID‑19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms.
NA,Moreover, SARS‑CoV‑2 particles were found in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of patients with COVID‑19.
NA,These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
NA,Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
NA,Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
NA,This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.
NA,COVID-19 - More Lung Pocus and Sparing Use of Stethoscope, Chest X-Ray and Lung CT <b>Abstract.</b> For an optimal management of COVID-19 (Coronary Virus Disease) we depend on a fast and reliable diagnosis and severity assessment.
NA,The gold standard so far is RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polmerase chain reaction) from the nasopharyngeal smear.
NA,Current tests have a sensitivity of 60-90 %.
NA,As a consequence, we must expect 10-40 % false negative results.
NA,In addition to oxygen saturation for severity classification, stethoscope, chest X-ray and lung computer tomography are routinely used.
NA,However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable.
NA,Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure.
NA,In view of the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), lung point-of-care ultrasound (Lu-PoCUS) is a still underutilized valuable alternative, especially when using pocket devices.
NA,In this review the current value and role of stethoscope, pulsoxymetry, chest x ray, lung computer tomography and lung point-of-care ultrasound will be determined based on the available literature. <b>Zusammenfassung.</b> Für ein optimales Management der COVID-19 (Coronary Virus Disease 19) sind wir auf eine schnelle und zuverlässige Diagnose sowie Schweregradeinschätzung angewiesen.
NA,Der Goldstandard ist bisher die RT-PCR (Reverse-Transkriptase-Polymerase-Kettenreaktion) aus dem nasopharyngealen Abstrich.
NA,Die aktuellen Tests weisen eine Sensitivität zwischen 60 und 90 % auf.
NA,In der Folge müssen wir mit 10–40 % falsch-negativen Ergebnissen rechnen.
NA,Neben der Sauerstoffsättigung zur Schweregradeinteilung werden das Stethoskop, das Thoraxröntgen und die Lungen-Computertomografie routinemässig für die Diagnose eingesetzt.
NA,Die Standardmethoden Stethoskop und Thoraxröntgen sind jedoch unzuverlässig.
NA,Überdies setzen alle drei diagnostischen Untersuchungsverfahren Ärztinnen, Ärzte, Hilfspersonal sowie Patientinnen und Patienten einem zusätzlichen Expositionsrisiko aus.
NA,Angesichts der Kontagiosität des SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) ist der Lungen-Point-of-Care-Ultraschall (PoCUS), insbesondere in der Anwendung als Taschenkittelgerät, eine noch zu wenig genutzte, wertvolle Alternative.
NA,In dieser Review werden die aktuelle Wertigkeit und Rolle von Stethoskop, Pulsoximetrie, Thoraxröntgen, Lungen-Computertomografie und Lungen-Point-of-Care-Ultraschall anhand der vorliegenden Literatur bestimmt.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly around the world, resulting in a massive death toll.
NA,Lung infection or pneumonia is the common complication of COVID-19, and imaging techniques, especially computed tomography (CT), have played an important role in diagnosis and treatment assessment of the disease.
NA,Herein, we review the imaging characteristics and computing models that have been applied for the management of COVID-19.
NA,CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up.
NA,The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored.
NA,Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19.
NA,In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,To counter COVID-19 spreading, an infrastructure to provide rapid and thorough molecular diagnostics and serology testing is the cornerstone of outbreak and pandemic management.
NA,We hereby review the clinical insights with regard to using molecular tests and immunoassays in the context of COVID-19 management life cycle: the preventive phase, the preparedness phase, the response phase and the recovery phase.
NA,The spatial and temporal distribution of viral RNA, antigens and antibodies during human infection is summarized to provide a biological foundation for accurate detection of the disease.
NA,We shared the lessons learned and the obstacles encountered during real world high-volume screening programs.
NA,Clinical needs are discussed to identify existing technology gaps in these tests.
NA,Leverage technologies, such as engineered polymerases, isothermal amplification, and direct amplification from complex matrices may improve the productivity of current infrastructure, while emerging technologies like CRISPR diagnostics, visual end point detection, and PCR free methods for nucleic acid sensing may lead to at-home tests.
NA,The lessons learned, and innovations spurred from the COVID-19 pandemic could upgrade our global public health infrastructure to better combat potential outbreaks in the future.
NA,Coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shows a rapid spread over-the-world.
NA,Given scarce resources, non-laboratory diagnostics is crucial.
NA,In this cross-sectional study, two-thirds of European patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, indicating the significance of this history in the early diagnostics.
NA,During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals are at the forefront of managing the highly infectious coronavirus.
NA,As the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation, it is critical for healthcare workers to have the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks and goggles.
NA,Surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and SARS, so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols from entering the respiratory system.
NA,Therefore, it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets, aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose.
NA,Various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings, such as half-mask filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).
NA,The most commonly used FFR is the N95 disposable respirator, which is tight fitting and has a 95% or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 µm.
NA,This review discusses respirators, their purpose, types, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.
NA,The prolonged lockdown of health facilities providing non-urgent gamete cryopreservation-as currently recommended by many reproductive medicine entities and regulatory authorities due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be detrimental for subgroups of male infertility patients.
NA,We believe the existing recommendations should be promptly modified and propose that the same permissive approach for sperm banking granted for men with cancer is expanded to other groups of vulnerable patients.
NA,These groups include infertility patients (eg, azoospermic and cryptozoospermic) undergoing medical or surgical treatment to improve sperm quantity and quality, as well as males of reproductive age affected by inflammatory and systemic auto-immune diseases who are about to start treatment with gonadotoxic drugs or who are under remission.
NA,In both scenarios, the &quot;fertility window&quot; may be transitory; postponing diagnostic semen analysis and sperm banking in these men could compromise the prospects of biological parenthood.
NA,Moreover, we provide recommendations on how to continue the provision of andrological services in a considered manner and a safe environment.
NA,Our opinion is timely and relevant given the fact that fertility services are currently rated as of low priority in most countries.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic in March 2020.
NA,A plethora of respiratory sampling methods for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection has been used and in the current evolving situation, there is no international consensus on the recommended method of respiratory sampling for diagnosis.
NA,Otolaryngologists deal intimately with the upper respiratory tract and a clear understanding of the respiratory sampling methods is of paramount importance.
NA,This article aims to provide an overview of the various methods and their evidence till date.
NA,The current outbreak of COVID-19 severe respiratory disease, which started in Wuhan, China, is an ongoing challenge, and a major threat to public health that requires surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand this emergent pathogen and to develop an effective response.
NA,Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines.
NA,Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens.
NA,Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights.
NA,Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
NA,In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
NA,Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
NA,Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
NA,The older Italian population is posing a challenge in the number of deaths for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19.
NA,The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person's vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis.
NA,The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.
NA,There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
NA,The emerging COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection poses severe challenges to global public health.
NA,Serum antibody testing is becoming one of the critical methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.
NA,We investigated IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein after symptom onset in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. 130 blood samples from 38 COVID-19 patients were collected.
NA,The levels of IgM and IgG specific to N and S protein were detected by ELISA.
NA,A series of blood samples were collected along the disease course from the same patient, including 11 ICU patients and 27 non-ICU patients for longitudinal analysis.
NA,N and S specific IgM and IgG (N-IgM, N-IgG, S-IgM, S-IgG) in non-ICU patients increased after symptom onset.
NA,N-IgM and S-IgM in some non-ICU patients reached a peak in the second week, while N-IgG and S-IgG continued to increase in the third week.
NA,The combined detection of N and S specific IgM and IgG could identify up to 75% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the first week.
NA,S-IgG was significantly higher in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients in the third week.
NA,In contrast, N-IgG was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients.
NA,The increase of S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients.
NA,N and S specific IgM and IgG increased gradually after symptom onset and can be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Analysis of the dynamics of S-IgG may help to predict prognosis.
NA,Cancer patients are presumed to be at increased risk from COVID-19 infection fatality due to underlying malignancy, treatment-related immunosuppression, or increased comorbidities.
NA,A total of 218 COVID-19 positive patients from March 18th-April 8th, 2020 with a malignant diagnosis were identified.
NA,A total of 61 (28%) cancer patients died from COVID-19 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37% (20/54) for hematologic malignancies and 25% (41/164) for solid malignancies. 6/11 (55%) lung cancer patients died from COVID-19 disease.
NA,Increased mortality was significantly associated with older age, multiple comorbidities, need for ICU support, and elevated levels of D-Dimers, LDH and lactate on multivariable analysis.
NA,Age-adjusted CFRs in cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients at our institution and NYC reported a significant increase in case fatality for cancer patients.
NA,These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population.
NA,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus recently isolated from humans.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be the pathogen responsible for a cluster of pneumonia cases associated with severe respiratory disease that occurred in December 2019 in China.
NA,This novel pulmonary infection, formally called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly in China and beyond.
NA,On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate.
NA,At present, chest-computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units.
NA,In this short communication, we present our experimental CXR scoring system that we are applying to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to quantify and monitor the severity and progression of this new infectious disease.
NA,We also present the results of our preliminary validation study on a sample of 100 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection for whom the final outcome (recovery or death) was available.
NA,To improve the risk stratification of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an experimental chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system for quantifying lung abnormalities was introduced in our Diagnostic Imaging Department.
NA,The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate correlations between the CXR score and the age or sex of Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Between March 4, 2020, and March 18, 2020, all CXR reports containing the new scoring system were retrieved.
NA,Only hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
NA,For each patient, age, sex, and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for the analysis.
NA,Patients were also divided into seven groups according to age.
NA,Nonparametric statistical tests were used to examine the relationship between the severity of lung disease and the age or sex.
NA,783 Italian patients (532 males and 251 females) with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
NA,The CXR score was significantly higher in males than in females only in groups aged 50 to 79 years.
NA,A significant correlation was observed between the CXR score and age in both males and females.
NA,Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older with coronavirus disease 2019 showed the highest CXR score (median ≥ 8).
NA,Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older showed the highest risk of developing severe lung disease.
NA,Our results may help to identify the highest-risk patients and those who require specific treatment strategies.
NA,This study describes a novel approach in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy.
NA,Five patients underwent tracheostomy between April 1, 2020 and April 17, 2020.
NA,A clear and sterile plastic drape was used as an additional physical barrier against droplets and aerosols.
NA,Operative diagnosis; droplet count and distribution on plastic sheet and face shields were documented.
NA,Tracheostomy was performed for patients with carcinoma of tonsil (n = 2) and nasopharynx (n = 1), and aspiration pneumonia (n = 2).
NA,Droplet contamination was noted on all plastic sheets (n = 5).
NA,Droplet contamination was most severe over the central surface at 91.5% (86.7%-100.0%) followed by the left and right lateral surfaces at 5.2% (6.7%-10.0%) and 3.3% (6.7%-10.0%), respectively.
NA,No droplet contamination was noted on all face shields.
NA,Plastic drapes can help reduce viral transmission to health care providers during tracheostomy.
NA,Face shields may be spared which in turn helps to conserve resources during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
NA,A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged and caused the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide.
NA,We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 29, 2020.
NA,Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. 112 patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhoea.
NA,All patients underwent antibody tests.
NA,Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both IgM and IgG, 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG.
NA,IgM antibody appeared within a week post disease onset, and lasted for one month and gradually decreased, while IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection, and lasted for a longer time.
NA,However, no significant difference in level of IgM and IgG antibody between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found.
NA,Our results indicate that serological tests could be powerful approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented scale.
NA,Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately-applicable protocol.
NA,RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8- ,16-, 32- and 64-sample pools) with negative samples.
NA,Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8.
NA,A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%.
NA,Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles.
NA,Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction.
NA,As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories.
NA,We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.
NA,The natural history of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi-organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest.
NA,We propose here the first model, explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, hangs on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, Mannose Binding Lectin ).
NA,If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens.
NA,The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm) leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal.
NA,Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended.
NA,However, extreme physical activity and hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19, facilitates early direct penetration of high numbers of virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway's mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies.
NA,This allows the virus bypassing the efficient immune barrier of the upper airways mucosa in already infected, young and otherwise healthy athletes.
NA,In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptative immune response reach the lungs first, is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.
NA,This &quot;quantitative and time-sequence dependent&quot; model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and rapidly spreading disease.
NA,There are limited published data on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 infection among organ transplant recipients.
NA,After initial flulike symptoms, progression to an inflammatory phase may occur, characterized by cytokine release rapidly leading to respiratory and multiorgan failure.
NA,We report the clinical course and management of a liver transplant recipient on hemodialysis, who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, and despite completing a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, later developed marked inflammatory manifestations with rapid improvement after administration of off-label, single-dose tocilizumab.
NA,We also highlight the role of lung ultrasonography in early diagnosis of the inflammatory phase of COVID-19.
NA,Future investigation of the effects of immunomodulators among transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection will be important.
NA,The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the medical and surgical healthcare systems.
NA,With the ongoing need for urgent and emergency colorectal surgery, including surgery for colorectal cancer, several questions pertaining to operating room (OR) utilization and techniques needed to be rapidly addressed.
NA,This manuscript discusses knowledge related to the critical considerations of patient and caregiver safety relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) and the operating room environment.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required contingent upon local availability of COVID-19 testing and the incidence of known COVID-19 infection in the respective community.
NA,In addition to standard COVID-19 PPE precautions, a negative-pressure environment, including an OR, has been recommended, especially for the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs).
NA,Hospital spaces ranging from patient wards to ORs to endoscopy rooms have been successfully converted from standard positive-pressure to negative-pressure spaces.
NA,Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered.
NA,Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles.
NA,Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management.
NA,This paper evaluates the issues surrounding these challenges including the OR environment and AGPs which are germane to surgical practices around the world.
NA,Although there is no single universally agreed upon set of answers, we have presented what we think is a balanced cogent description of logical safe approaches to colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has urged the development and implementation of guidelines and protocols on diagnosis, management, infection control strategies, and discharge planning.
NA,However, very little is currently known about neonatal COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.
NA,Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation.
NA,Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW.
NA,In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population.
NA,The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes.
NA,The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear.
NA,Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists.
NA,Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure.
NA,As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.
NA,KEY POINTS: · Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic urged development of guidelines..
NA,· Neonatal COVID-19 disease is uncommon..
NA,· Respiratory outcomes in neonates seems favorable..
NA,· Current neonatal respiratory care should continue..
NA,· Clinicians should watch frequently for updates..
NA,In late 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in Wuhan, China.
NA,A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever.
NA,During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.
NA,We examined the characteristics of these patients.
NA,A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020.
NA,Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history.
NA,Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels.
NA,Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment.
NA,No patients had a fever (&gt;37.2°C).
NA,One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery.
NA,Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
NA,Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases.
NA,The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P &lt; .05).
NA,The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%).
NA,Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P &lt; .05).
NA,Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally.
NA,Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.
NA,Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.
NA,Lung ultrasound examination has been demonstrated to be an accurate imaging method to detect pulmonary and pleural conditions.
NA,During pregnancy, there is a need for a rapid assessment of the maternal lung in patients suspected to have COVID-19.
NA,We report our experience on lung ultrasound examination in the diagnosis of Sars-Cov-2 pneumonia in a pregnant woman.
NA,Typical ultrasound features of this pulmonary pathology, including diffuse hyperechoic vertical artifacts with thickened pleural line and &quot;white lung&quot; with patchy distribution, were observed.
NA,We suggest point of care lung ultrasound examination as a diagnostic imaging tool in pregnant women with suspected COVID-19.
NA,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea.
NA,However, digestive symptoms have also been reported.
NA,At first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect more than half of patients.
NA,The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain.
NA,Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection.
NA,Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign.
NA,The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases.
NA,Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images consistent with COVID-19 infection.
NA,No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.
NA,Moreover, the endoscopists may themselves be at significant risk of contamination.
NA,Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.
NA,In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.
NA,In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
NA,Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.
NA,Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.
NA,Clinical intervention in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated a strong upregulation of cytokine production in patients who are critically ill with SARS-CoV2-induced pneumonia.
NA,In a retrospective study of 41 patients with COVID-19, most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed mild symptoms, whereas some patients later developed aggravated disease symptoms, and eventually passed away because of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as a consequence of a severe cytokine storm.
NA,Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020; these guidelines recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring should be applied in severely ill patients to reduce pneumonia related mortality.
NA,The cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 illness is also an important component of mortality in other viral diseases, including SARS, MERS and influenza.
NA,In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated cytokine and immune response.
NA,To analyze the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic renal failure complicated with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to evaluate the effect of blood purification technology on the treatment and prognosis of such patients.
NA,Two COVID-19 cases undergoing hemodialysis with chronic renal failure were retrospectively analysed in our hospital.
NA,Two COVID-19 patients were admitted to hospital due to cough, with or without fever.
NA,Laboratory tests showed decreased lymphocyte count, elevated PCT, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2R, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, NT-proBNP, creatinine, and urea nitrogen.
NA,Chest CT scan showed multiple blurred plaques and patchy shadows in both patients.
NA,Two patients received continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) every other day for 4-6 h everytime, in addition to the standard treatment.
NA,After CVVHDF, not only cytokines were reduced, but also liver function and cardiac function significantly improved.
NA,Both patients did not develop severe pneumonia.
NA,They were discharged on March 1, 2020 when meeting the discharge criteria.
NA,Two COVID-19 patients on maintenance hemodialysis discharged after a month of hospitalization.
NA,The removal of cytokines through blood purification technology may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Since December 2019, new COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred and spread around the world.
NA,However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear.
NA,In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases.
NA,We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020.
NA,Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed.
NA,Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases.
NA,Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering.
NA,The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %).
NA,The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days.
NA,Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis.
NA,CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura.
NA,Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases.
NA,After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group.
NA,Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes.
NA,The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period.
NA,The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low.
NA,The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city.
NA,According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate.
NA,Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes.
NA,No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition.
NA,Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.
NA,The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection who had presented with and been treated for acute limb ischemia (ALI) during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.
NA,We performed a single-center, observational cohort study.
NA,The data from all patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had presented with ALI requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database.
NA,For the present series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (&lt;30 days) re-occlusion or major amputation or death within 24 hours.
NA,The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (≤30 days) and late (≥30 days) survival, postoperative (≤30 days) complications, and limb salvage.
NA,We evaluated the data from 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19.
NA,For the period from January to March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly greater than that for the same months in 2019 (23 of 141 [16.3%] vs 3 of 163 [1.8%]; P &lt; .001)].
NA,Of the 20 included patients, 18 were men (90%) and two were women (10%).
NA,Their mean age was 75 ± 9 years (range, 62-95 years).
NA,All 20 patients already had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Operative treatment was performed in 17 patients (85%).
NA,Revascularization was successful in 12 of the 17 (70.6%).
NA,Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs 83.3%; P = .622), no patient who had received intravenous heparin required reintervention.
NA,Of the 20 patients, eight (40%) had died in the hospital.
NA,The patients who had died were significantly older (81 ± 10 years vs 71 ± 5 years; P = .008).
NA,The use of continuous postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs 57.1%; P = .042).
NA,In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardy region.
NA,Successful revascularization was lower than expected, which we believed was due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state.
NA,The use of prolonged systemic heparin might improve surgical treatment efficacy, limb salvage, and overall survival.
NA,Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19.
NA,Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea.
NA,The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey.
NA,Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.
NA,Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission.
NA,Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172).
NA,Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea.
NA,Fever (&gt;37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals.
NA,As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission.
NA,Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not.
NA,Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.
NA,To discuss the effects of the SARS-Cov-2 betacoronavirus on ambulatory ophthalmology practices, the value proposition of telemedicine, tele-ophthalmology implementation methodologies, and the accelerated future of telemedicine.
NA,Review of the current telehealth landscape including usage, policies, and techniques for ambulatory practice integration.
NA,We provide author-initiated review of recent trends in telehealth, governmental recommendations for healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a PubMed Central query for telemedicine in ophthalmology or tele-ophthalmology.
NA,In addition, authors' comprehensive experience in telemedicine design and implementation is provided.
NA,A summary describing the present state of telehealth, tele-ophthalmology modeling, care delivery, and the proposed impact of telehealth surges on the future of ophthalmology practice.
NA,Recent patient and provider interest in telemedicine, the relaxation of regulatory restrictions, increased remote care reimbursement, and ongoing social distancing practices compels many ophthalmologists to consider virtualizing services.
NA,Since early December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases associated with unknown coronavirus infection were identified in Wuhan, China, and many additional cases were identified in other regions of China and in other countries within 3 months.
NA,Currently, more than 80,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, including more than 3000 deaths.
NA,The epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world, posing a grave challenge to prevention and control.
NA,On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.
NA,According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems.
NA,In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first isolated from Wuhan city, China and within three months, the global community was challenged with a devastating pandemic.
NA,The rapid spread of the virus challenged diagnostic laboratories to rapidly develop molecular diagnostic methods.
NA,As SARS CoV-2 assays became available for testing on existing molecular platforms, laboratories devoted unprecedented energy and resources into evaluating the analytical performance of the new tests and in some cases developed their own diagnostic assays under FDA-EUA guidance.
NA,This study compares the validation of three different molecular assays at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Virology laboratory: the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, ePlex® SARS-CoV-2, and the CDC COVID-19 RT-PCR tests.
NA,Overall, our studies indicate a comparable analytical performance of the three assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,There is limited data on the analytical performance of commercial nucleic acid tests (NATs) for laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection.
NA,Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses.
NA,Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes.
NA,Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay.
NA,Using the in-house assays as the &quot;gold standard&quot;, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 %, 92.16 %, 55.56 % and 100 % respectively.
NA,The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, p = 0.0031).
NA,The AusDiagnostics assay is not specific for the detection SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Any positive results should be confirmed using another NAT or sequencing.
NA,The case definition used to investigate persons with suspected COVID-19 infection is not specific.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a severe acute respiratory syndrome that is called COVID-19.
NA,Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
NA,Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG.
NA,Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions.
NA,SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist in peripheral blood and may be capable of providing effective information about protective immunity.
NA,The T cells studies can be helpful in elucidating the pathways for development of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for COVID-19 and for filling these immunology knowledge gaps.
NA,Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has emerged, rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacity of the global health community.
NA,Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population.
NA,Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future.
NA,Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods.
NA,However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 h to process.
NA,These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests.
NA,Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection.
NA,Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods.
NA,Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols.
NA,We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results.
NA,Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating.
NA,We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.
NA,The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time.
NA,Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge.
NA,Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020).
NA,According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces.
NA,In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed.
NA,The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
NA,The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm.
NA,Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.
NA,Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials.
NA,There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units.
NA,Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions.
NA,Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments.
NA,Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes.
NA,By the 1<sup>st</sup> of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine.
NA,Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support.
NA,The new era of nuclear medicine practice worldwide coincides with a new era for the Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine (HSNM) and the Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine (HJNM).
NA,The founder and Editor in Chief for more than 28 consecutive years, Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos, resigned leaving behind a benchmark for the presidencies and editors to come.
NA,His commitment to the conservation of a high level of scientific excellence of the published papers is the legacy which we wish to maintain in the future publications.
NA,The interim Editor in Chief of the current issue, would like to express her gratitude to Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos for his contribution to the global scientific community as well as to the incoming Editor in Chief Konstantinos Anagnostopoulos, MD, PhD, FRCP, FESC for accepting this new role.
NA,We wholeheartedly welcome the new Editor in Chief and the new members of the Editorial Board, wishing them an active, attentive and successful mandate.
NA,Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine will remain true to the set principles, values and past and prepared to cope with future challenges in the scientific and clinical setting.
NA,COVID-19 threatens millions of lives, especially elderly population and people with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
NA,Rapid and effective diagnoses are vital for the isolation of infected people and starting treatment immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus.
NA,Bioinformatics techniques such as artificial intelligence should be used for collecting the hemogram and serum biochemistry data of all COVID-19- infected people worldwide, even they do not show severe symptoms.
NA,These data may help find a biomarker that can be used in combination with the CT results for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in Wuhan, China several months ago,<sup>1</sup> has led to large-scale lockdown in many countries around the world, including Spain.
NA,Uncertainty about the duration of these measures led us to consider the potential impact of diagnostic delays due to the paralyzation of certain health procedures and services on the prognosis of patients with melanoma.
NA,To prevent and control public health emergencies, we set up a prescreening and triage workflow and analyzed the effects on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In accordance with the requirements of the level 1 emergency response of public health emergencies in Shaanxi Province, China, a triage process for COVID-19 was established to guide patients through a 4-level triage process during their hospital visits.
NA,The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positive COVID-19 nucleic acid testing according to the unified triage standards of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial version 4),4 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
NA,The screened rate of suspected COVID-19 was 1.63% (4 of 246) in the general fever outpatient clinic and 8.28% (13 of 157) in the COVID-19 outpatient clinic, and they showed a significant difference (P = .00).
NA,The triage procedure effectively screened the patients and identified the high-risk population.
NA,The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and clinical outcome among patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study.
NA,A total of 95 patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled.
NA,The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction detection of target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
NA,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained.
NA,ARDS was defined as an oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) ≤300 mm Hg.
NA,Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; p = 0.008) and high body mass index (OR, 1.327; p = 0.024) were independent risk factors associated with patients with pneumonia.
NA,For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.046; p = 0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase level (OR, 1.010; p = 0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS.
NA,A total of 70 patients underwent CT imaging repeatedly after treatment.
NA,Patients were divided in a disease exacerbation group (n = 19) and a disease relief group (n = 51).
NA,High body mass index (OR, 1.285; p = 0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR, 16.13; p = 0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment.
NA,These study results help in the risk stratification of patients with 2019-nCoV infection.
NA,Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression.
NA,This consensus document has been drawn up by the Techniques and Transplantation and Nursing areas of the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) and the Spanish Society of Respiratory Endoscopy (AEER) with the aim of providing information on the safe and effective use of bronchoscopy in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
NA,Our priority is to ensure the safety of our patients, the health workers caring for them, and the community in general.
NA,At this stage in the pandemic, our information on the use of bronchoscopy in patients of this type is based on the experience of hospitals in other countries, and scientific publications are scarce.
NA,The objective of this document is to compile these experiences, based on recommendations from official agencies, in a document offering guidance in daily clinical practice.
NA,On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has presented rapid person-to-person transmission and is currently a global pandemic.
NA,In the largest number of cases described to date of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease (2019-nCoViD), 26% required care in an intensive care unit (ICU).
NA,This pandemic is causing an unprecedented mobilization of the scientific community, which has been associated with an exponentially growing number of publications in relation to it.
NA,This narrative literature review aims to gather the main contributions in the area of intensive care to date in relation to the epidemiology, clinic, diagnosis and management of 2019-nCoViD.
NA,Sentinel surveillance among severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients can help identify the spread and extent of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in India.
NA,We describe here the positivity for COVID-19 among SARI patients and their characteristics.
NA,SARI patients admitted at 41 sentinel sites from February 15, 2020 onwards were tested for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, targeting E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Data were extracted from Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network for analysis.
NA,A total of 104 (1.8%) of the 5,911 SARI patients tested were positive for COVID-19.
NA,These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 States/Union Territories.
NA,The COVID-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years.
NA,In all, 40 (39.2%) COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel.
NA,COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting COVID-19 cases among SARI patients.
NA,Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts.
NA,In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019, governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions under high uncertainty at their best efforts.
NA,In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions.
NA,For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc.
NA,Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships.
NA,In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented.
NA,Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques.
NA,As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused infection in 168,000 cases worldwide in about 148 countries and killed more than 6,610 people around the world as of March 16, 2020, as per the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, there is the rapid transmission, long incubation period, and disease containment is becoming extremely difficult.
NA,The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers.
NA,We also discussed various preventive measures to combat COVID-19 effectively.
NA,A systematic and protocol-driven approach is needed to contain this disease, which was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the WHO.
NA,COVID-19 is the most rapidly growing pandemic in modern time, and the need for serological testing is most urgent.
NA,Although the diagnostics of acute patients by RT-PCR is both efficient and specific, we are also crucially in need of serological tools for investigating antibody responses and assessing individual and potential herd immunity.
NA,We evaluated a commercially available test developed for rapid (within 15 minutes) detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by 29 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 124 negative controls.
NA,The results revealed a sensitivity of 69% and 93.1% for IgM and IgG, respectively, based solely on PCR-positivity due to the absence of a serological gold standard.
NA,The assay specificities were shown to be 100% for IgM and 99.2% for IgG.
NA,This indicates that the test is suitable for assessing previous virus exposure, although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection.
NA,More detailed studies on antibody responses during and post infection are urgently needed.
NA,Since December 2019, increasing attention has been paid to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Wuhan, China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory tract and lungs, leading to pneumonia and other systemic disorders.
NA,The effect of SARS-CoV-2 in transplant recipients has raised significant concerns, especially because there is a large population of transplant recipients in China.
NA,Based on the current epidemic situation, this study reviewed publications on this virus and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), analyzed common features of respiratory viral pneumonias, and presented the currently reported clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in transplant recipients to improve strategies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in this special population.
NA,We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features, and medical care-seeking process of patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, to provide useful information to contain COVID-19 in other places with similar outbreaks of the virus.
NA,We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020.
NA,The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed.
NA,Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission.
NA,It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later.
NA,After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus.
NA,Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks' isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.
NA,Since the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019, its infection - COVID-19 - has been associated with severe morbidity and mortality and has left world governments, healthcare systems and providers caring for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, wrestling with the optimal management strategy.
NA,Unique physiologic and ethical considerations negate a one-size-fits-all approach to the care of critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19, and few resources exist to guide the multi-disciplinary team through decisions regarding optimal maternal-fetal surveillance, intensive care procedures, and delivery timing.
NA,We present a case of rapid clinical decompensation and development of severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in a woman at 31 weeks' gestation to highlight these unique considerations and present an algorithmic approach to the disease's diagnosis and management.
NA,The presentation of COVID-19 overlaps with common influenza symptoms.
NA,There is limited data on whether a specific symptom or collection of symptoms may be useful to predict test positivity.
NA,An anonymous electronic survey was publicized through social media to query participants with COVID-19 testing.
NA,Respondents were questioned regarding 10 presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities and COVID-19 test results.
NA,Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID positivity.
NA,Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC).
NA,One-hundred and forty-five participants with positive COVID-19 testing and 157 with negative results were included.
NA,Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female.
NA,Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID-19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p&lt;0.05).
NA,A model using all 5 diagnostic symptoms had the highest accuracy with a predictive ability of 82% in discriminating between COVID-19 results.
NA,To maximize sensitivity and maintain fair diagnostic accuracy, a combination of 2 symptoms, change in sense of smell or taste and fever was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and overall discrimination accuracy of 75%.
NA,Smell or taste change is a strong predictor for a COVID-19 positive test result.
NA,Using the presence of smell or taste change with fever, this parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 75% of COVID-19 test results.
NA,A larger cohort of respondents will be necessary to refine classifier performance.

NA,The rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is affecting many countries.
NA,While healthcare systems need to cope with the need to treat a large number of people with different degrees of respiratory failure, actions to preserve aliquots of the healthcare system to guarantee treatment to patients are mandatory.
NA,In order to protect the Fondazione IRCCS-Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano from the spread of COVID-19, a number of to-hospital and within-hospital filters were applied.
NA,Among others, a triage process to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in patients with cancer was developed consisting of high-resolution low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nose-throat swabs whenever CT was suggestive of lung infection.
NA,To serve symptomatic patients who were already admitted to the hospital or in need of hospitalization while waiting for RT-PCR laboratory confirmation of infection, a COVID-19 surveillance zone was set up.
NA,A total of 301 patients were screened between March 6 and April 3, 2020.
NA,Of these, 47 were hospitalized, 53 needed a differential diagnosis to continue with their cancer treatment, and 201 were about to undergo surgery.
NA,RT-PCR was positive in 13 of 40 hospitalized patients (32%), 14 of 52 day hospital patients (27%), and 6 of 201 surgical patients (3%).
NA,Applying filters to protect our comprehensive cancer center from COVID-19 spread contributed to guaranteeing cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis in Milan.
NA,A surveillance area and surgical triage allowed us to protect the hospital from as many as 33 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease).
NA,Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection.
NA,Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively.
NA,(Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.)
NA,Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively.
NA,(Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.)
NA,Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%.
NA,The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively.
NA,At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively.
NA,Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 vírus infection in the general population.
NA,These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.

NA,Bevezetés: 2020. március végén a SARS-CoV-2-vírusfertőzöttség (COVID–19-betegség) diagnosztizálására megjelentek Magyarországon a vírussal szembeni specifikus antitestek jelenlétét kimutató gyorstesztek.
NA,Célkitűzés: Munkánkban két gyorsteszt, az Anhui és a Clungene teszt diagnosztikai teljesítményét értékeltük a fertőzés kimutatásában arany standardnak számító ’real-time’ (valós idejű) PCR (a továbbiakban: PCR) vizsgálati eredmények alapján.
NA,Módszer: 2020. március 16. és április 14. között intézetünk 20 120, COVID–19-fertőzéssel kapcsolatos rekordot küldött be az országos adatszolgáltató rendszeren keresztül.
NA,Ebben 4140 személynél csak IgM és IgG jelenlétét kimutató gyorstesztvizsgálat történt; 3210 személynél csak PCR-teszt, 1654 személynél pedig PCR- és gyorstesztvizsgálat (Anhui: 625, Clungene: 1029) végzésére maximum 3 nap eltéréssel is sor került.
NA,PCR-pozitívnak azt a személyt tekintettük, akinél bármikor PCR-pozitivitás fordult elő, illetve antitestpozitívnak azt, akinél IgM- és/vagy IgG-pozitivitást észleltünk.
NA,(Megjegyzés: a Clungene tesztet Lungene néven is forgalmazzák.)
NA,Eredmények: A 4864, PCR-rel vizsgált személy közül 308 volt PCR-pozitív (a PCR-pozitivitás prevalenciája 6,3% volt).
NA,A PCR alapján az Anhui gyorsteszt szenzitivitása 33,3%, specificitása 72,85%; a Clungene gyorsteszt szenzitivitása 35,48%, specificitása 85,02% volt. 6%-os PCR-pozitivitási prevalencia esetén a pozitív és a negatív prediktív érték az Anhui gyorsteszt esetében 7,28%, illetve 94,48%, míg a Clungene gyorsteszt esetében 13,13%, illetve 95,38% volt.
NA,Következtetés: Az aktuális fertőzöttségi prevalencia melletti alacsony pozitív prediktív értékek alapján az általunk értékelt gyorstesztek jelenleg nem alkalmasak a SARS-CoV-2-vírusfertőzöttség (PCR-pozitivitás) kimutatására az általános populációban.
NA,Az Anhui és a Clungene gyorstesztek negatív eredményei a jelenlegi 6%-os prevalencia mellett mintegy 95%-os valószínűséggel jelzik a SARS-CoV-2-vírusexpozíció hiányát.
NA,Az Anhui és a Clungene – SARS-CoV-2 vírus elleni IgM- és IgG-antitesteket kimutató – gyorstesztek alkalmazása a COVID–19-fertőzés differenciáldiagnosztikájában szakmailag vállalhatatlan.

NA,We aimed to describe typical radiological features and progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
NA,We reviewed the chest CT scans, laboratory findings, and clinical records of 66 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to affiliated hospitals of Nanchang university, Nanchang, China, from Jan 21 to Feb 2, 2020.
NA,CT was used to evaluate the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Only 4 patients (4/66, 6%) claimed their exposure to COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
NA,The major symptoms were fever (60/66, 91%) and cough (37/66, 56%).
NA,The predominant features of lesion were scattered (43/66, 65%), bilateral (50/66, 76%), ground-glass opacity (64/66, 97%), and air bronchogram sign (47/66, 71%).
NA,Forty-eight patients (48/66, 73%) had more than two lobes involved.
NA,Right lower lobe (58/66, 88%) and left lower lobe (49/66, 74%) were most likely invaded.
NA,Twelve patients (12/66, 18%) had at least one comorbid condition.
NA,Pleural traction (29/66, 44%), crazy paving (15/66, 23%), interlobular septal thickening (11/66, 17%), and consolidation (7/66, 11%) were also observed.
NA,The typical radiology features of COVID-19 patients are scattered ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lobes.
NA,Fever and cough are the major symptoms.
NA,Evaluating chest CT, clinical symptoms, and laboratory results could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and judge disease progression.
NA,Recent advances in electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are reviewed.
NA,Electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are broadly reviewed in terms of transduction elements, biorecognition elements, electrochemical techniques, and biosensor performance.
NA,Transduction elements are discussed in terms of electrode material and form factor.
NA,Biorecognition elements for pathogen detection, including antibodies, aptamers, and imprinted polymers, are discussed in terms of availability, production, and immobilization approach.
NA,Emerging areas of electrochemical biosensor design are reviewed, including electrode modification and transducer integration.
NA,Measurement formats for pathogen detection are classified in terms of sample preparation and secondary binding steps.
NA,Applications of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of pathogens in food and water safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and bio-threat applications are highlighted.
NA,Future directions and challenges of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are discussed, including wearable and conformal biosensors, detection of plant pathogens, multiplexed detection, reusable biosensors for process monitoring applications, and low-cost, disposable biosensors.
NA,Chest CT is thought to be sensitive but less specific in diagnosing the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,The diagnostic value of CT is unclear.
NA,We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre-Wuhan, China.
NA,Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled.
NA,Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus.
NA,With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed.
NA,A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled.
NA,34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR.
NA,The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT.
NA,The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69.
NA,No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT.
NA,The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34).
NA,Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center.
NA,To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR.
NA,This retrospective study aims to illustrate the radiographic characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the correlation with the clinical course. 195 hospitalized patients confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 at First Hospital of Changsha, Hunan Province from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020 were enrolled.
NA,Chest computed tomography scan, clinical data and laboratory tests results were collected accordingly.
NA,Variable characteristics were recorded, radiographic evolution and outcome were analyzed along with the time course.
NA,Representative laboratory tests results were analyzed based on the image findings.
NA,Majority of the patients showed bilateral (73.8%), multiple lobes involvements (75.9%), peripheral distribution (83.1%), ground-glass opacification (41.0%), increased vascular margins (63.1%), long axis parallelism (55.9%), patchy ground-glass opacities beneath the pleura (51.3%) and consolidation (45.6%).
NA,According to the repeated radiology analysis, patients of improving/stable group tended to have younger age compared with worsening group (45.3 ± 15.0 VS.
NA,59.3 ± 13.5, P = 0.001).
NA,Based on the laboratory test results, patients with positive image findings shared elder age, 46.0 (35.0-60.0)VS.31.0 (12.0-37.0) P &lt; 0.001, and higher chance developing fever(P &lt; 0.05); higher level of lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase; lower level of white blood cells, neutrophil and albumin(P &lt; 0.001).
NA,There are several specific image changes along with the disease progression may be helpful in early recognition and differential diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019.
NA,Comprehensive assessments of both imaging feature and laboratory test results may offer an intact knowledge of Coronavirus Disease 2019.
NA,To improve resource allocation in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals around the country are restricting the performance of elective surgery to preserve ventilators, operating rooms, ICU beds and protect anesthesiologists.
NA,For patients with severe aortic stenosis, efforts to bring treatment to symptomatic patients amid this pandemic might lead to favored use of catheter based management using minimalist techniques that do not require these elements.
NA,In this context, some patients with well tested surgical indications for valve replacement may be treated by catheter-based methods.
NA,It is important that outcomes for these cases are followed closely both at respective sites and in national registries.
NA,As we recover from this pandemic, surgical cases should once again be driven by multi-disciplinary discussion and clinical trial data, and not a mentality of crisis management.
NA,In the last three decades, microfluidics and its applications have been on an exponential rise, including approaches to isolate rare cells and diagnose diseases on the single-cell level.
NA,The techniques mentioned herein have already had significant impacts in our lives, from in-the-field diagnosis of disease and parasitic infections, through home fertility tests, to uncovering the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and their host cells.
NA,This review gives an overview of the field in general and the most notable developments of the last five years, in three parts: 1.
NA,What can we detect?
NA,2.
NA,Which detection technologies are used in which setting?
NA,3.
NA,How do these techniques work?
NA,Finally, this review discusses potentials, shortfalls, and an outlook on future developments, especially in respect to the funding landscape and the field-application of these chips.
NA,Recently, due to the coronavirus pandemic, many guidelines and anti-contagion strategies continue to report unclear information about the persistence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the environment.
NA,This certainly generates insecurity and fear in people, with an important psychological component that is not to be underestimated at this stage of the pandemic.
NA,The purpose of this article is to highlight all the sources currently present in the literature concerning the persistence of the different coronaviruses in the environment as well as in medical and dental settings.
NA,As this was a current study, there are still not many sources in the literature, and scientific strategies are moving towards therapy and diagnosis, rather than knowing the characteristics of the virus.
NA,Such an article could be an aid to summarize virus features and formulate new guidelines and anti-spread strategies.
NA,<b>Introduction</b>: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are segments of nucleic acid that play a role in prokaryotic defense and form the basis of a genome editing technology that allows permanent alteration of genetic material.
NA,This methodology, known as CRISPR-Cas9, is poised to revolutionize molecular biology, but no literature yet exists on how these advances will affect hospitalists.<b>Areas covered</b>: These specialists in inpatient medicine care for a wide variety of hospitalized patients, including those with infectious disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, hematologic disease, and a variety of other conditions that may soon be impacted by advances in gene-modifying technology provided by CRISPR-Cas9.
NA,A Literature search was performed using PubMed [1 December 2019-17 April 2020].<b>Expert opinion</b>: This paper reviews the remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the CRISPR-Cas9 platform and concludes with a look at ethical issues and technical hurdles pertaining to the implementation of permanent gene modification in the practice of Hospital Medicine.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in physicians having to switch from in office visits to telemedicine.
NA,Unfortunately, physicians and patients did not have adequate time to anticipate barriers to its implementation.
NA,Over the last month, one of the major problems has been patient access to telemedicine.
NA,Many patients do not own a smartphone or have broadband access.
NA,This &quot;digital divide&quot; is not fair to our patients in need-especially those with a cancer diagnosis.
NA,Patients deserve access to care.
NA,We need to implore insurance companies to provide tablets with wireless capabilities to patients in need.
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and later the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced that COVID-19 had reached global pandemic status.
NA,This article summarized the understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention and control measures of COVID-19 based on the available data and anti-epidemic experience in China.
NA,The ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout China and other countries, and has been characterized as a pandemic.
NA,With the strict prevention and control measures implemented by the Chinese government, the spread of the epidemic in China has come under preliminary control by the end of February, 2020, whereas the situation of some countries outside China is not optimistic and raises great public concern.
NA,In fighting COVID-19, radiologic examinations played a critical role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and could also help assess disease course and severity.
NA,There is an urgent need to share useful experience and effective measures internationally.
NA,This article outlines the collaborative actions and efforts by the Chinese radiology field and the situation of front-line health care workers in radiology departments to present the world with experiences and examples of Chinese radiology during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already assumed pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in few weeks.
NA,A global response is needed to prepare health systems worldwide.
NA,Covid-19 can be diagnosed both on chest X-ray and on computed tomography (CT).
NA,Asymptomatic patients may also have lung lesions on imaging.
NA,CT investigation in patients with suspicion Covid-19 pneumonia involves the use of the high-resolution technique (HRCT).
NA,Artificial intelligence (AI) software has been employed to facilitate CT diagnosis.
NA,AI software must be useful categorizing the disease into different severities, integrating the structured report, prepared according to subjective considerations, with quantitative, objective assessments of the extent of the lesions.
NA,In this communication, we present an example of a good tool for the radiologist (Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, Italy) in Covid-19 diagnosis (Pan et al. in Radiology, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020200370).
NA,Thoracic VCAR offers quantitative measurements of the lung involvement.
NA,Thoracic VCAR can generate a clear, fast and concise report that communicates vital medical information to referring physicians.
NA,In the post-processing phase, software, thanks to the help of a colorimetric map, recognizes the ground glass and differentiates it from consolidation and quantifies them as a percentage with respect to the healthy parenchyma.
NA,AI software therefore allows to accurately calculate the volume of each of these areas.
NA,Therefore, keeping in mind that CT has high diagnostic sensitivity in identifying lesions, but not specific for Covid-19 and similar to other infectious viral diseases, it is mandatory to have an AI software that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one.
NA,Fast and widespread diagnosis is crucial to fighting against the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,This work surveys the landscape of available and emerging biosensor technologies for COVID-19 testing.
NA,Molecular diagnostic assays based on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are used in most clinical laboratories.
NA,However, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed testing capacity and motivated the development of fast point-of-care tests and the adoption of isothermal DNA amplification.
NA,Antigenic and serological rapid tests based on lateral-flow immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity.
NA,Advanced digital systems enhance performance at the expense of speed and the need for large equipment.
NA,Emerging technologies, including CRISPR gene-editing tools, benefit from high sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostics and the easy use of lateral-flow assays.
NA,DNA sequencing and sample pooling strategies are highlighted to bring out the full capacity of the available biosensor technologies and accelerate mass testing.
NA,To determine whether COVID-19 may adversely affect outcome of myocardial infarction (MI) patients in Hong Kong, China.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has infected thousands of people and placed enormous stress on healthcare system.
NA,Apart from being an infectious disease, it may affect human behavior and healthcare resource allocation which potentially cause treatment delay in MI.
NA,This was a single center cross-sectional observational study.
NA,From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19.
NA,There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64).
NA,For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%).
NA,The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs.
NA,29.7%, p = .02).
NA,More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes.
NA,Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care.
NA,EDTA dependent pseudothrombocytopenia (EDTA-PCTP) is a phenomenon that characterized by a spurious decrease of platelets in vitro due to the aggregation of platelets in EDTA anticoagulant blood samples.
NA,We report the first case of a transient appearance of EDTA-PCTP in a patient with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).
NA,A 59-year-old woman was admitted to the isolated ward for severe type of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.
NA,At the time of admission, her platelet count was in a normal range.
NA,Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding.
NA,Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal.
NA,The phenomenon disappeared after 17 days when the patient was cured.
NA,This case emphasized the importance of peripheral blood smear and clinical manifestation, especially in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.
NA,BACKGROUND Chest CT has an essential role in the detection and evaluation of novel coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) and has be regarded as a critical supplement for RT-PCR.
NA,This study explored the dynamic CT manifestations of COVID-19 at different times and the value of some laboratory indicators for clinical guidance.
NA,MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective review included 44 patients who were infected with COVID-19.
NA,The dynamic chest CT and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records.
NA,The intervals between onset and CT scans and the dynamic changes of the lesions were recorded.
NA,The above data were reviewed, sorted, and analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 software.
NA,RESULTS From the time of onset, the dynamic image of the lungs became more complete.
NA,Fibrous cord shadow absorption in the lungs were observed.
NA,Experimental indicators, biochemical indicators of lymphocytes, and protein series were decreased to varying degrees, while erythrocyte sedimentation, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were increased to varying degrees.
NA,CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
NA,Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now considered a pandemic causing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), multiple fatalities and morbidities which have been associated with it worldwide.
NA,We report a severe pneumonia causing acute respiratory distress syndrome due to a coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and Parainfluenza 4 virus in a Hispanic 21 year old male in Florida, USA.
NA,The case represents the importance of prompt diagnosis and awareness of the potential co-infection with other respiratory viruses and this novel deadly virus.
NA,In patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough and dyspnea, are the most frequent clinical manifestations.
NA,These patients may also present with less well-defined symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort both at the time of diagnosis and during the clinical course.
NA,In a few cases, these symptoms may also present before the appearance of respiratory symptoms.
NA,To penetrate the body, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses ACE2 receptors, which are present not only in respiratory epithelium but also in gastrointestinal mucosa and liver cholangiocytes.
NA,In several cases, viral RNA is detectable in the stool of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The liver damage seems to show a multifactorial origin.
NA,About 2%-11% of patients with COVID-19 have known underlying hepatic pathologies.
NA,In 14%-53% of COVID-19 cases, there is an alteration of the indices of liver cytolysis and is more frequently observed in severe forms of COVID-19, especially during hospitalization.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers.
NA,Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important.
NA,Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals.
NA,However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case.
NA,A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization.
NA,She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence.
NA,But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, <i>etc</i>.
NA,On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation.
NA,The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 1.04 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, respectively.
NA,CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity.
NA,The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture.
NA,On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated.
NA,On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced.
NA,Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized.
NA,Both conditions require effective prompt actions, especially COVID-19.
NA,The emerging infection of COVID-19 was initiated from Wuhan, China, have been spread to more than 210 countries around the globe including India.
NA,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses.
NA,The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World.
NA,Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings.
NA,Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality.
NA,Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks.
NA,The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics.
NA,Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered.
NA,The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.
NA,COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
NA,COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.
NA,The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.
NA,Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.
NA,However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.
NA,We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.
NA,We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.
NA,Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.
NA,We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤9•5 10<sup>9</sup>/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1•1 10<sup>9</sup>/L).
NA,Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤9•5 10<sup>9</sup>/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1•1 10<sup>9</sup>/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0•02 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and elevated hs-CRP (≥4 mg/L) were presented in 95•0%, 52•2%, 74•7% and 86•7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87•2%, 28•8%, 31•3% and 45•2% of the controls, respectively.
NA,The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74•7% and specificity of 68•7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0•717.
NA,The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67•9% and specificity of 78•2% (AUC=0•730).
NA,The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).
NA,The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.
NA,This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.
NA,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Hubei Province (MSTIP).
NA,A viral pneumonia rapidly spread from Wuhan, China to all countries in late 2019.
NA,In February 2020, WHO named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020.
NA,To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Ministry of Health of Republic of Turkey and international institutions have published documents defining hygiene rules.
NA,After the lung computerized tomography (CT) findings which are important in the diagnosis of COVID-19 are described, protection measures against infection were defined in radiology departments.
NA,There is no publication involving protection measures for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in nuclear medicine (NM) (appointment, patient acceptance, imaging and treatment procedures, disinfection etc).
NA,There are two reports on CT findings suggesting COVID-19 in <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan.
NA,These lung findings detected in hybrid images will be helpful in the early diagnosis of pulmonary involvement.
NA,Infected cases may be asymptomatic and can unintentionally disseminate the virus to surrounding people.
NA,This advisory guide has been prepared to avoid infection risk in NM clinics.
NA,During the COVID-19 outbreak, staff must use proper personal protective equipment and patients should be evaluated as the elective case according to clinical status.
NA,A questionnaire should be made for COVID-19.
NA,In cancer cases requiring urgent treatment, radionuclide treatment (RNT) should be planned according to the COVID-19 test result.
NA,If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.
NA,Following imaging procedures, scanners and room surfaces should be cleaned by personnel with proper disinfection training. 2019’un sonlarında, viral pnömoni Wuhan, Çin’den hızla tüm ülkelere yayıldı.
NA,Şubat 2020’de Dünya Sağlık Örgütü Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) olarak adlandırdı ve 11 Mart 2020’de pandemi geliştiğini açıkladı.

NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to explore the value of CT in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, especially for patients who have negative initial results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 19, 2020, to February 20, 2020, were included.
NA,All patients underwent chest CT and swab RT-PCR tests within 3 days.
NA,Patients were divided into groups with negative (seven patients) and positive (14 patients) initial RT-PCR results.
NA,The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. <b>RESULTS.</b> Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated.
NA,Most of the COVID-19 lesions were located in multiple lobes (67%) in both lungs (72%) in our study.
NA,The main CT features were ground-glass opacity (95%) and consolidation (72%) with a subpleural distribution (100%).
NA,Otherwise, 33% of patients had other lesions around the bronchovascular bundle.
NA,The other CT features included air bronchogram (57%), vascular enlargement (67%), interlobular septal thickening (62%), and pleural effusions (19%).
NA,Compared with that in the group with positive initial RT-PCR results, CT of the group with negative initial RT-PCR results was less likely to show pulmonary consolidation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results.
NA,Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.
NA,To assess admission rates to 7 General Hospital Psychiatric Wards (GHPWs) located in the Lombardy Region in the 40 days after the start of COVID-19 epidemic, compared to similar periods of 2020 and 2019.
NA,Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed.
NA,The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds.
NA,In the 40-day period (February 21st-March 31st 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to 21 February, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates.
NA,The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions.
NA,The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of 'Other' diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc.
NA,Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset.
NA,We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioural problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians.
NA,It is unclear from the study whether the reduction in admissions was contributed to most by the current pandemic or the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic.'
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory disease occurred in Wuhan, China.
NA,It is an emerging infectious disease with widespread and rapid infectiousness.
NA,The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on 31 January 2020.
NA,Severe COVID-19 patients should be managed and treated in a critical care unit.
NA,Performing a chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease.
NA,The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc.
NA,The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition.
NA,The management of COVID-19 should focus on early diagnosis, immediate isolation, general and optimized supportive care, and infection prevention and control.
NA,In view of the new viral COVID-19 pandemic, the fungal Candida auris epidemic still in progress worldwide highlights non-Candida albicans candidal infections.
NA,We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar, which proved to be the nidus for the candidemia.
NA,We stress the value of selectively removing eschars.
NA,C. parasilopsis and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections.
NA,We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
NA,Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and fomite adhesiveness!
NA,Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines.
NA,During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris.
NA,The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.
NA,To determine the pooled global prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as <i>anosmia, dysgeusia</i>, and <i>COVID-19</i>.
NA,Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening.
NA,Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed.
NA,Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated.
NA,Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19.
NA,Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
NA,Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.
NA,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
NA,Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
NA,To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
NA,The clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are not pathogen specific.
NA,Highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests have become the diagnostic reference standard for viruses and translation of bacterial assays from basic research to routine clinical practice represents an exciting advance in respiratory medicine.
NA,Most recently, molecular diagnostics have played an essential role in the global health response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
NA,How best to use newer molecular tests for RTI in combination with clinical judgment and traditional methods can be bewildering given the plethora of available assays and rapidly evolving technologies.
NA,Here, we summarize the current state of the art with respect to the diagnosis of viral and bacterial RTIs, provide a practical framework for diagnostic decision-making using selected patient-centered vignettes, and make recommendations for future studies to advance the field.
NA,Intra-operative aerosol generating procedures are arguably unavoidable in the routine provision of thoracic anaesthesia.
NA,Airway management for such patients during the COVID-19 pandemic including tracheal intubation, lung isolation, one-lung ventilation and flexible bronchoscopy may pose a significant risk to healthcare professionals and patients.
NA,That said, there remains a need for timely thoracic surgery for patients with lung cancer or thoracic trauma.
NA,The thoracic anaesthetic community has been confronted with the need to modify existing techniques to maximise safety for patients and healthcare professionals.
NA,With appropriate modification, aerosol generation may be mitigated against in most circumstances.
NA,We developed a set of practice-based recommendations for airway management in thoracic surgical patients, which have been endorsed by the Association for Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Critical Care and the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland.
NA,COVID-19 is rapidly spreading worldwide and specific literature how to deal with IBD patients is limited so far.
NA,Here, the World Endoscopy Organisation (WEO) is providing practical advice for the management of IBD patients during the pandemic covering the diagnostic and therapeutic spectrum.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to systemic coagulation activation and thrombotic complications.
NA,We investigated the incidence of objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 198 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a single-center cohort study.
NA,Seventy-five patients (38%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
NA,At time of data collection, 16 (8%) were still hospitalized and 19% had died.
NA,During a median follow-up of 7 days (IQR, 3-13), 39 patients (20%) were diagnosed with VTE of whom 25 (13%) had symptomatic VTE, despite routine thrombosis prophylaxis.
NA,The cumulative incidences of VTE at 7, 14 and 21 days were 16% (95% CI, 10-22), 33% (95% CI, 23-43) and 42% (95% CI 30-54) respectively.
NA,For symptomatic VTE, these were 10% (95% CI, 5.8-16), 21% (95% CI, 14-30) and 25% (95% CI 16-36).
NA,VTE appeared to be associated with death (adjusted HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.02-5.5).
NA,The cumulative incidence of VTE was higher in the ICU (26% (95% CI, 17-37), 47% (95% CI, 34-58), and 59% (95% CI, 42-72) at 7, 14 and 21 days) than on the wards (any VTE and symptomatic VTE 5.8% (95% CI, 1.4-15), 9.2% (95% CI, 2.6-21), and 9.2% (2.6-21) at 7, 14, and 21 days).
NA,The observed risk for VTE in COVID-19 is high, particularly in ICU patients, which should lead to a high level of clinical suspicion and low threshold for diagnostic imaging for DVT or PE.
NA,Future research should focus on optimal diagnostic and prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE and potentially improve survival.
NA,Patients with pituitary tumours, ensuing hormonal abnormalities and mass effects are usually followed in multidisciplinary pituitary clinics and can represent a management challenge even during times of non-pandemic.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has put on hold routine medical care for hundreds of millions of patients around the globe, while many pituitary patients' evaluations cannot be delayed for too long.
NA,Furthermore, the majority of patients with pituitary tumours have co-morbidities potentially impacting the course and management of COVID-19 (e.g. hypopituitarism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease).
NA,Here, we summarize some of the diagnostic and management dilemmas for these patients, and we provide guidance on safe and as effective as possible delivery of care in the COVID-19 era.
NA,We also attempt to address how pituitary services should be remodelled in the event of similar crises, while maintaining or even improving patient outcomes.
NA,Regular review of these recommendations and further adjustments are needed, depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic status.
NA,We consider that utilization of successful models of pituitary multidisciplinary care implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should continue after the crisis is over by using the valuable and exceptional experience gained during these challenging times.
NA,Analysis of the temporal, seasonal and demographic distribution of dengue virus (DENV) infections in Barbados was conducted using national surveillance data from a total of 3994 confirmed dengue cases.
NA,Diagnosis was confirmed either by DENV-specific real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), or non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; a case fatality rate of 0.4% (10/3994) was observed.
NA,The prevalence rate of dengue fever (DF) varied from 27.5 to 453.9 cases per 100,000 population among febrile patients who sought medical attention annually.
NA,DF cases occurred throughout the year with low level of transmission observed during the dry season (December to June), then increased transmission during rainy season (July to November) peaking in October.
NA,Three major dengue epidemics occurred in Barbados during 2010, 2013 and possibly 2016 with an emerging three-year interval.
NA,DF prevalence rate among febrile patients who sought medical attention overall was highest among the 10-19 years old age group.
NA,The highest DF hospitalisation prevalence rate was observed in 2013.
NA,Multiple serotypes circulated during the study period and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was the most prevalent serotype during 2010, whilst DENV-1 was the most prevalent serotype in 2013.
NA,Two DENV-1 strains from the 2013 DENV epidemic were genetically more closely related to South East Asian strains, than Caribbean or South American strains, and represent the first ever sequencing of DENV strains in Barbados.
NA,However, the small sample size (<i>n =</i> 2) limits any meaningful conclusions.
NA,DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males.
NA,Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.
NA,The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados.
NA,SARS-CoV2 is a novel coronavirus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization.
NA,Thanks to the latest advancements in the field of molecular and computational techniques and information and communication technologies (ICTs), artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data can help in handling the huge, unprecedented amount of data derived from public health surveillance, real-time epidemic outbreaks monitoring, trend now-casting/forecasting, regular situation briefing and updating from governmental institutions and organisms, and health facility utilization information.
NA,The present review is aimed at overviewing the potential applications of AI and Big Data in the global effort to manage the pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel enveloped single stranded RNA coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an ongoing global pandemic.
NA,While other countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays.
NA,As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, severely hampering containment efforts.
NA,COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce disease spread.
NA,Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies.
NA,A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients.
NA,Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity.
NA,Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.
NA,The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison).
NA,Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented.
NA,In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement.
NA,We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation.
NA,Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied.
NA,For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement?
NA,We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations.
NA,Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations.
NA,Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them.
NA,We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for an ongoing human pandemic (COVID-19).
NA,There is a massive international effort underway to develop diagnostic reagents, vaccines, and antiviral drugs in a bid to slow down the spread of the disease and save lives.
NA,One part of that international effort involves the research community working with plants, bringing researchers from all over the world together with commercial enterprises to achieve the rapid supply of protein antigens and antibodies for diagnostic kits, and scalable production systems for the emergency manufacturing of vaccines and antiviral drugs.
NA,Here, we look at some of the ways in which plants can and are being used in the fight against COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 epidemic is believed to have started in late January 2020 in France.
NA,Here we report a case of a patient hospitalised in December 2019 in an intensive care unit in a hospital in the north of Paris for haemoptysis with no aetiological diagnosis.
NA,RT-PCR was performed retrospectively on the stored respiratory sample and confirmed the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
NA,Based on this result, it appears that the COVID-19 epidemic started much earlier in France.
NA,The differential diagnosis between novel coronavirus pneumonia patients (NCPP) and influenza patients (IP) remains a challenge in clinical practice.
NA,Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1,027 NCPP and 1,140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital.
NA,Routine blood examination, biochemical indicators and coagulation function analysis were simultaneously performed in all participants.
NA,There was no sex predominance in NCPP.
NA,The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life.
NA,The mean age of NCPP (56±16 years) was higher than IP (47±17 years), but without statistical difference.
NA,Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant differences, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP.
NA,It was observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase and d-dimer compared with IP.
NA,However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with IP.
NA,The diagnostic model based on a combination of 18 routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777-0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and specificity of 90.09% when using a cut-off value of 0.598.
NA,Some routine laboratory results had statistical difference between NCPP and IP.
NA,A diagnostic model based on a combination of routine laboratory results provided an adjunct approach in the differential diagnosis between NCPP and IP.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has affected more than 1 270 000 people worldwide.
NA,The numbers of reported cases continue to rise and threaten global health.
NA,Transmissions among family members are frequently observed, although the route of transmission is partially known.
NA,Here we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within one family.
NA,Sequencing of the S gene of the viral genome showed 100% identity among samples, suggesting that the same strain caused the infection.
NA,Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings.
NA,Our observations suggest the importance of preventing family transmission and the efficacy of current integrated treatment for mild/moderate pneumonia in COVID-19 cases.
NA,A 40-year-old man developed acute brainstem dysfunction 3 days after hospital admission with symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).
NA,Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in keeping with inflammation of the brainstem and the upper cervical cord, leading to a diagnosis of rhombencephalitis.
NA,No other cause explained the patient's abnormal neurological findings.
NA,He was managed conservatively with rapid spontaneous improvement in some of his neurological signs and was discharged home with continued neurology follow up.
NA,A 17-year-old healthy girl underwent an uneventful esthetic septorhinoplasty.
NA,She was easily extubated and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%.
NA,About 30 minutes after arrival in the PACU, she developed dyspnea with SpO2 of 84% and promptly received oxygen with bilevel positive airway pressure in conjunction with low-dose corticosteroid.
NA,The subsequent chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates similar to the radiologic findings of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Finally, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a pharyngeal specimen confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a significant challenge to global healthcare.
NA,Acute stroke care requires rapid bedside attendance, imaging, and intervention.
NA,However, for acute stroke patients who have a diagnosis of or are under investigation for COVID-19, the concern for nosocomial transmission moderates operational procedures for acute stroke care.
NA,We present our experience with an in-hospital stroke code called on a COVID-19-positive patient with a left middle cerebral artery syndrome and the challenges faced for timely examination, imaging, and decision to intervene.
NA,The outlook for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of protocols to sustain timely and effective acute stroke care while mitigating healthcare-associated transmission.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has officially been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography (CT), play an important role in the fight against COVID-19.
NA,A comprehensive and timely review of radiological role in the fight against COVID-19 remains urgent and mandatory.
NA,Hence, the aim of this review is to summarize the radiological role in the fight against COVID-19.
NA,This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19.
NA,The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes.
NA,A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion.
NA,Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.
NA,In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, and it subsequently spread in many countries around the world.
NA,Many efforts have been applied to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and many scientific studies have been conducted in a short period of time.
NA,Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
NA,Current researches on potentially effective treatment alternatives are discussed.
NA,We hope this review can help medical workers and researchers around the world contain the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The last two decades have witnessed two large-scale pandemics caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
NA,At the end of 2019, another novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hit Wuhan, a city in the center of China, and subsequently spread rapidly to the whole world.
NA,Latest reports revealed that more than 800 thousand people in over 200 countries are involved in the epidemic disease by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Due to the high mortality rate and the lack of optimum therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the biological characteristics of the virus and its possible pathogenesis to respond to the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control.
NA,However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics.
NA,Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development.
NA,In this review, we focus on our current understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapeutics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,COVID-19 pandemic can cause irreparable damage to the involved society.
NA,This study aimed to provide a summary of the up-to-dated clinical display, diagnostics, molecular and genetic implications for COVID-19 infected patients.
NA,In this review, 73 research articles published before 25 March 2020 were analyzed to better understand the clinical characteristics of patients and to introduce the available serological, hematology and molecular diagnostic methods.
NA,Apart from articles extracted from PubMed and Google Scholar, WHO (https://www.who.int/), NHC (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/) were also accessed to search for eligible studies.
NA,Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms &quot;2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test&quot; were used.
NA,As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
NA,We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
NA,All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
NA,To summarize the current practice and potential strategy in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,PubMed, Web of Science were systematically searched using terms including &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; and &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;.
NA,After removing duplicates, we then identified articles, letters and commentaries regarding diagnosing COVID-19.
NA,Here we summarized relatively mature diagnostic methods like nuclear acid test and computed tomography.
NA,Besides, new aspects regarding these detection methods like suitable specimens for nuclear acid test, possible use of 18F-FDG PET/CT were also reported.
NA,Especially, we also presented several novel techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 like lung ultrasound.
NA,Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) by National Health Commission is recommended to follow as it provides detailed diagnostic procedures using currently available tools.
NA,We suggest clinicians further explore the saliva's utility as a specimen for nuclear acid test and the use of lung ultrasound.
NA,<b> <i>Problem:</i> </b> The emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and a growing body of information compel inquiry regarding the transmissibility of infection between humans and certain animal species.
NA,Although there are a number of issues to be considered, the following points are most urgent: The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread.
NA,The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry.
NA,The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical military service animals including explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, combat tracker dog, mine detection dog, tactical explosive detector dog, improvised explosive device detector dog, patrol explosive detector dog, and patrol narcotics detector dog, as well as multipurpose canines used by special operations such as used by the U.S. customs and border protection agency (<i>e.g.</i>, Beagle Brigade).
NA,This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions.
NA,1.
NA,What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans?
NA,2.
NA,What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock?
NA,3.
NA,What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers?
NA,Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study.
NA,First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers.
NA,If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created.
NA,Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients.
NA,Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance.
NA,Since its emergence in December 2019, scientific knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved rapidly but, due to the complexity and novelty of this infection and its political and economic stakes, much remains to be clarified.
NA,Thousands of studies have already been published and scientific research is constantly evolving.
NA,In this multitude of information, we offer an update of the knowledge currently available.
NA,A limitation of the propagation, the understanding of the functioning of the virus and its clinical manifestations, the administration of specific treatments, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are the basis of the fight against this germ, which is still little known today.
NA,Depuis son apparition en Décembre 2019, les connaissances scientifiques concernant le virus SARS-CoV-2 ont rapidement évolués mais, en raison de la complexité et nouveauté de cette infection et de ses enjeux politiques et économiques, encore beaucoup reste à clarifier.
NA,Des milliers d’études ont déjà été publiés et la recherche scientifique est en constante évolution.
NA,Dans cette multitude d’informations, nous proposons une mise à jour des connaissances actuellement disponibles.
NA,Une limitation de la propagation, la compréhension du fonctionnement du virus et de ses manifestations cliniques, l’administration de traitements spécifiques et des outils diagnostiques rapides et fiables, sont à la base de la lutte contre ce germe à présent encore méconnu.
NA,Emergency departments are on the front line in the management of COVID-19 cases, from screening to the initial management of the most severe cases.
NA,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 range from non-specific symptoms to adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,Diagnosis is based on PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab and emergency treatment rely on oxygen therapy.
NA,Patient's orientation (home, hospitalization, admission in intensive care unit) is a central aspect of emergency management.
NA,The shift from a strategy of systematic recognition of potential cases to the one of epidemic mitigation required hospital emergency medicine services to implement crisis management measures, to guarantee admission and hospitalization capacity.
NA,Les services d’urgences sont en première ligne dans la gestion des cas de COVID-19, qu’il s’agisse du dépistage ou de la prise en charge des cas les plus sévères.
NA,La clinique associée au COVID-19 va de symptômes non spécifiques au syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë de l’adulte.
NA,Le diagnostic repose sur la PCR à partir d’un frottis nasopharyngé et le traitement d’urgence sur l’oxygénothérapie.
NA,L’orientation du patient (retour à domicile, hospitalisation, indication aux soins intensifs) est un aspect central de la prise en charge aux urgences.
NA,Le passage de la stratégie de reconnaissance systématique des cas potentiels à celle de la mitigation de l’épidémie a impliqué pour les services d’urgences hospitaliers la mise en place de mesures exceptionnelles afin de garantir une capacité d’accueil et d’hospitalisation.
NA,The nasopharyngeal smear with PCR analysis is the first diagnostic test proposed to confirm infection with COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2.
NA,However, its usefulness in emergency centers is limited due to its imperfect sensitivity (56-83 %), limited availability and the time required to obtain results.
NA,For this reason, the chest CT-scan has been proposed as a rapid triage tool for diagnosis in these suspect Covid-19 patients.
NA,However, its specificity is limited, exposing to the risk of over-diagnosis, and further data are needed to confirm its usefulness, and to highlight the possible prognostic value of the CT, in detecting early lesions associated with poor outcome, indicating the need for admission to intensive care.
NA,Le frottis nasopharyngé avec analyse par PCR est le premier test diagnostique proposé pour confirmer une infection à SARS-CoV-2, virus de la maladie COVID-19.
NA,Son utilité dans les centres d’urgence est cependant limitée du fait de sa sensibilité imparfaite (56 à 83 %), de sa disponibilité restreinte et du délai pour l’obtention des résultats.
NA,Aussi, le CT-scan thoracique a été proposé comme outil de triage rapide pour poser le diagnostic chez ces patients suspects de COVID-19.
NA,Toutefois, sa spécificité est limitée, exposant au risque de surdiagnostic.
NA,Des données complémentaires sont nécessaires pour confirmer son utilité et lui attribuer une éventuelle valeur pronostique, capable de déceler des lésions associées à une mauvaise évolution, indiquant la nécessité d’une admission aux soins intensifs.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019, SARS-COV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and an increased stress on hospital resources, which has resulted in a spike in the anxiety of the frontline healthcare workers.
NA,News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing.
NA,We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed.
NA,In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19.
NA,When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE.
NA,However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different.
NA,In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure.
NA,We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols.
NA,A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist.
NA,At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.
NA,The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 210 000 deaths worldwide.
NA,However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features.
NA,To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests.
NA,Prospective cohort study.
NA,Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The first 12 consecutive COVID-19-positive deaths.
NA,Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed.
NA,Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (<i>n</i> = 10) or outpatient sector (<i>n</i> = 2).
NA,Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively).
NA,Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients.
NA,Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients.
NA,In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart.
NA,Limited sample size.
NA,The high incidence of thromboembolic events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy.
NA,Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism and overall clinical incidence of COVID-19-related death, as well as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce it.
NA,University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.
NA,Outpatient telemedicine consultations are being adopted to triage patients for head and neck cancer.
NA,However, there is currently no established structure to frame this consultation.
NA,For suspected referrals with cancer, we adapted the Head and Neck Cancer Risk Calculator (HaNC-RC)-V.2, generated from 10 244 referrals with the following diagnostic efficacy metrics: 85% sensitivity, 98.6% negative predictive value, and area under the curve of 0.89.
NA,For follow-up patients, a symptom inventory generated from 5123 follow-up consultations was used.
NA,A customized Excel Data Tool was created, trialed across professional groups and made freely available for download at www.entintegrate.co.uk/entuk2wwtt, alongside a user guide, protocol, and registration link for the project.
NA,Stakeholder support was obtained from national bodies.
NA,No remote consultations were refused by patients.
NA,Preliminary data from 511 triaging episodes at 13 centers show that 77.1% of patients were discharged directly or have had their appointments deferred.
NA,Significant reduction in footfall can be achieved using a structured triaging system.
NA,Further refinement of HaNC-RC-V.2 is feasible and the authors welcome international collaboration.
NA,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major health crisis, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) having infected over a million people around the world within a few months of its identification as a human pathogen.
NA,Initially, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the respiratory system and causes inflammation and cell death.
NA,Subsequently, the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues, triggering a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes and symptoms, including cardiovascular complications.
NA,Acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV entering mammalian cells, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function.
NA,Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment.
NA,This review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed patients and healthcare givers alike and challenged our practice of antenatal care, including fetal diagnosis and therapy.
NA,This document aims to review relevant recent information to allow us to optimize prenatal care delivery.
NA,We discuss potential modifications to obstetric management and fetal procedures in SARS-CoV2-negative and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with fetal anomalies or disorders.
NA,Most fetal therapies are time sensitive and cannot be delayed.
NA,If personnel and resources are available, we should continue to offer procedures of proven benefit, acknowledging any fetal and maternal risks, including those to health care workers.
NA,There is, to date, minimal, unconfirmed evidence of spontaneous vertical transmission, though it may theoretically be increased with some procedures.
NA,Knowing a mother's preoperative SARS-CoV-2 status would enable us to avoid or defer certain procedures while she is contagious and to protect health care workers appropriately.
NA,Some fetal conditions may alternatively be managed neonatally.
NA,Counseling regarding fetal interventions which have a possibility of additional intra- or postoperative morbidity must be performed in the context of local resource availability.
NA,Procedures of unproven benefit should not be offered.
NA,We encourage participation in registries and trials that may help us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women, their fetuses, and neonates.
NA,Hospitals play a critical role in providing communities with essential medical care during all types of disaster.
NA,Depending on their scope and nature, disasters can lead to a rapidly increasing service demand that can overwhelm the functional capacity and safety of hospitals and the healthcare system at large.
NA,Planning during the community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is critical for maintaining healthcare services during our response.
NA,This paper describes, besides general measures in times of a pandemic, also the necessary changes in the invasive diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with different entities of acute coronary syndromes including structural adaptations (networks, spokes and hub centres) and therapeutic adjustments.
NA,On February 19<sup>th</sup> 2020, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) has announced the first 2 cases of SARS-CoV-2, a novel emerging coronavirus which causes an infection termed as COVID-19, in Qom city.
NA,As such, the Iranian government, through the establishment of the &quot;National Headquarters for the management and control of the novel Coronavirus&quot;, has started implementing policies and programs for the prevention and control of the virus.
NA,These measures include schools and universities closure, reduced working hours, and increased production and delivery of equipment such as masks, gloves and hygienic materials for sterile environments.
NA,The government has also made efforts to divulge high-quality information concerning the COVID-19 and to provide laboratories and hospitals with diagnostic kits and adequate resources to treat patients.
NA,However, despite such efforts, the number of cases and deaths has progressively increased with rising trends in total confirmed cases and deaths, as well as in new daily cases and deaths associated with the COVID-19.
NA,Iran is a developing country and its economic infrastructure has been hit hardly by embargo and sanctions.
NA,While developed countries have allocated appropriate funding and are responding adequately to the COVID-19 pandemics, Iran has experienced a serious surge of cases and deaths and should strive to provide additional resources to the health system to make healthcare services more accessible and to increase the fairness of that access.
NA,All relevant actors and stakeholders should work together to fight this disease.
NA,The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world's population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels.
NA,More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.
NA,Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19.
NA,We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19.
NA,Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives.
NA,In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk.
NA,Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention.
NA,For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions.
NA,Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme.
NA,In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2.
NA,Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse.
NA,The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics.
NA,If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction.
NA,Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.
NA,As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues its proliferation globally, this paper shares the findings and experiences of modelling the outbreak in China and its provinces and proposes implications for the study of infectious diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic in other nations.
NA,An NLS (non-linear least square) method estimated the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function of new COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and nations with a large amount of cases based on training data from Feb. 20 to Mar.
NA,13.
NA,A restriction test was subsequently employed to test whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries.
NA,We conducted diagnosis of the residuals and also its goodness of fit with testing data from Mar. 13 to Apr.
NA,18.
NA,We find that the model fits time series data exceedingly well in China, its provinces, and two other nations, and we provide estimates of key parameters.
NA,We reject the null hypothesis that the growth rate of the outbreak is the same among ten selected provinces as well as between South Korea and Iran.
NA,We also find that the model does not provide reliable estimates in countries that are in the early stages of outbreak.
NA,We further find that the R<sup>2</sup> value be varied and misleading when compared among different curves of the same nonlinear model, as well as the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and nations.
NA,We believe that there is potential for our model to contribute to better public health policy combatting COVID-19 by providing a simple logistical framework for retrospectively analyzing the outbreak in regions that have already experienced maximal proliferation in cases.
NA,However, based upon our statistical findings, we outline certain pitfalls in modelling and their implications on results.
NA,From a total of 71 laboratory-confirmed cases, three presymptomatic patients and 10 patients with entirely asymptomatic infections were identified.
NA,In two of the three incubation period patients, the viral titer in the presymptomatic period was very high (Ct value&lt;20).
NA,The median number of days to first negative RT-PCR in the asymptomatic carriers was 4.5 (range 2.5-9), and all asymptomatic carriers reached a first RT-PCR Ct&gt;35 within 14 days after diagnosis.
NA,Patients who have COVID-19 may already be infectious before there are symptoms, and 14 days of isolation after diagnosis may be sufficient in entirely asymptomatic cases.
NA,COVID-19 can severely affect pregnant women and the issue of vertical transmission of sars-cov-2 has also emerged.
NA,Sars-cov-2 could be recovered by real-time (RT) PCR from nasal and throat swabs, sputum and feces of symptomatic patients including neonates but not from vaginal swabs, amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal blood or breast milk.
NA,Viremia was present in 1% of symptomatic adults.
NA,We identified 12 articles published between February 10<sup>th</sup> and April 4<sup>th</sup> 2020 reporting on 68 deliveries and 71 neonates with maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy.
NA,Perinatal exposure, including mode of delivery and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection are crucial in differentiating congenital from perinatal infection.
NA,Neonatal infection is usually asymptomatic.
NA,Neonatal infection was diagnosed within 48 hours of life in 4 cases.
NA,Detection rates of real-time PCR and the interpretation of IgM and IgG antibodies levels in cord and neonatal blood are discussed in relation with the immaturity of the fetal and neonatal immune system.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic starting in Wuhan in December, 2019 has spread rapidly throughout the nation.
NA,The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time.
NA,AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential.
NA,To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation.
NA,For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients.
NA,During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis.
NA,In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.
NA,To explore the value of the &quot;dandelion clock-like&quot; sign on chest CT for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.
NA,This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020.
NA,The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded.
NA,Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia.
NA,We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia.
NA,Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms.
NA,Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like &quot;crazy-paving&quot; patterns.
NA,The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a &quot;dandelion clek-like&quot; sign and 37 with a &quot;dandelion seed sign&quot;.
NA,These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.
NA,The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.
NA,The ongoing epidemic of caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 starting in December 2019 poses a serious public health threat globally.
NA,The virus is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through droplets and contacts, and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia.
NA,A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death.
NA,The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak.
NA,In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system.
NA,These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.
NA,To evaluate the effects of heat inactivation of blood samples at 56℃ for 30 min on the results of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection using different methods.
NA,This retrospective study was conducted in 11 patients with established diagnosis of COVID-19 and 10 patients with diseases other than COVID- 19 in our hospital.
NA,We collected samples of serum, plasma and whole blood from each patient between February, 12 and 18, 2020, and with a double- blind design, the samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min.
NA,In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay.
NA,We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples.
NA,With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%.
NA,For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively.
NA,For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%.
NA,Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%<i>CI</i>: 0.9998-1.000, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation.
NA,Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 ℃ for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators.
NA,Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.
NA,To investigate the correlation between the clinical classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the imaging characteristics of multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) volume scanning of the lungs.
NA,The clinical data and thoracic MSCT volume scanning data were analyzed retrospectively for 102 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College between January 18 and February 26, 2020.
NA,According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type.
NA,The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19.
NA,Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19.
NA,The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue.
NA,Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea.
NA,Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments.
NA,Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
NA,The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05).
NA,MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.
NA,To identify the biomarkers as early warning signals for severe COVID-19.
NA,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases.
NA,The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups.
NA,Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19.
NA,The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19.
NA,The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
NA,The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
NA,Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.046-1.526, <i>P</i>=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.
NA,An increased NLR can serve as an early warning signal of severe COVID-19.
NA,We review the experience with the diagnosis and treatment of secondary cerebral infarction in an elderly patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,COVID-19 has rapid disease progression with a high mortality rate in elderly patients, and physicians should be alert to secondary bacterial infection that may result in coagulation dysfunction and cerebral infarction.
NA,Early anti-infection therapy, immune regulation and appropriate anticoagulation intervention may help improve the prognosis of the patients.
NA,Members of family <i>Coronaviridae</i> cause a variety of diseases in birds and mammals.
NA,Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs ≤4 weeks of age.
NA,No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity.
NA,Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown.
NA,To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds.
NA,Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (<i>n</i> = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (<i>n</i> = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of ≥0.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups.
NA,The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (&gt;28 weeks old) on commercial farms (<i>n</i> = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease.
NA,The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], ±1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, ±3.70%).<b>IMPORTANCE</b> There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds.
NA,This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds.
NA,These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations.
NA,Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.
NA,The year 2020 has seen a major and sustained outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2) infection that causes fever, severe respiratory illness and pneumonia, a disease called Covid-19.
NA,At the time of writing, the death toll was greater than 120 000 worldwide with more than 2 million documented infections.
NA,The genome of the CoV encodes a number of structural proteins that facilitate cellular entry and assembly of virions, of which the spike protein S appears to be critical for cellular entry.
NA,The spike protein guides the virus to attach to the host cell.
NA,The spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fusion domain and a transmembrane domain.
NA,The RBD of spike protein S binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate cellular entry.
NA,The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to the pangolin and bat CoVs and these also use ACE2 as a receptor.
NA,Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 exposes the cleavage sites to cellular proteases.
NA,Cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 and other cellular proteases initiates fusion and endocytosis.
NA,The spike protein contains an addition furin cleavage site that may allow it to be 'preactivated' and highly infectious after replication.
NA,The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests.
NA,This review briefly outlines the structure and function of the 2019 novel CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S.
NA,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic.
NA,It was initially thought to spare children and adolescents as significantly smaller number of cases have been reported in the pediatric population in comparison to adults.
NA,Here, we report the case of a 16-month-old female infant from Lebanon who presented with fever and severe diarrhea and tested positive for COVID-19.
NA,Her symptoms started six days prior to presentation with no cough, rhinorrhea, or other respiratory manifestations reported.
NA,Chest radiography showed lobar consolidation and bronchial infiltrates.
NA,Blood culture was positive for <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>.
NA,Stool and urine cultures were negative.
NA,She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
NA,Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults.
NA,The patient likely contracted the virus from her parents, who because of the fear of social stigma hide recent history of respiratory illness.
NA,These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19.
NA,Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic is currently one of the most influential topics as it not only impacts the field of medicine but most importantly, it affects the lives of many individuals throughout the world.
NA,We report an interesting 2019-nCoV case in a tertiary community hospital with the initial concern of acute pyelonephritis without respiratory symptoms that ultimately led to the quarantine of a number of healthcare providers.
NA,This case emphasizes the importance of radiological evidence in diagnosing 2019-nCoV in the setting of an initial atypical presentation.
NA,It also serves as an example of how healthcare providers may need to increase their suspicion for COVID-19 to ensure self-protection and prompt diagnosis in the era of an ongoing pandemic.
NA,There remains diagnostic uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal specimens.
NA,We present a case where two nasopharyngeal specimens were negative, followed by a positive sputum sample.
NA,Serial testing for COVID-19 is indicated in patients with high pretest probability of disease.
NA,Patients with cancer are at high-risk for mortality from coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy with overlapping clinical and imaging features with COVID-19, however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury.
NA,We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results.
NA,The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed.
NA,The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 3/1/2020.
NA,All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing.
NA,Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed.
NA,Three out of four patients tested positive for COVID-19.
NA,All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea.
NA,Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19.
NA,Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization.
NA,Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field.
NA,As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
NA,We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic poses a high risk to older people.
NA,The aim of this paper is to provide a rapid overview of the COVID-19 literature, with a specific focus on older adults.
NA,We frame our findings within an overview of the disease and have also evaluated the inclusion of older people within forthcoming clinical trials.
NA,We searched PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv to identify English language papers describing the testing, treatment and prognosis of COVID-19.
NA,PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv searches took place on 20th and 24th March 2020, respectively.
NA,Screening of over 1100 peer-reviewed and pre-print papers yielded n = 22 on COVID-19 testing, n = 15 on treatment and n = 13 on prognosis.
NA,Viral-PCR and serology are the mainstays of testing but a positive diagnosis may be increasingly supported by radiological findings.
NA,The current evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral, corticosteroid and immunotherapies is inconclusive, although trial data are largely based on younger people.
NA,In addition to age, male gender and comorbidities, specific laboratory and radiology findings are important prognostic factors.
NA,Evidence suggests social distancing policies could have important negative consequences, particularly if in place for an extended period.
NA,Given the established association between increasing age and poor prognosis in COVID-19, we anticipate that this rapid review of the current and emergent evidence might form a basis on which future work can be established.
NA,Exclusion of older people, particularly those with comorbidities, from clinical trials is well recognised and is potentially being perpetuated in the field of current COVID-19 research.
NA,Nanotechnology and nanomedicine have excellent potential in dealing with a range of different health problems, including viruses, which are considered to be a serious challenge in the medical field.
NA,Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses.
NA,There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among these, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples.
NA,This article aims to provide an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of nanoparticles as diagnostic or antiviral tools against coronaviruses.
NA,The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors in this field are also presented.
NA,The evidence on the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly growing.
NA,Understanding why some patients suffering from COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe.
NA,The answer to this question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic.
NA,Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role.
NA,An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined.
NA,More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
NA,Herewith, presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.
NA,Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.
NA,Olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs) have recently been reported among patients with COVID-19, and it has been hypothesised that oral and nasal tissues may contain host cells of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We report on two cases (spouses) with SARS-CoV-2 infection with self-reported OTDs, but otherwise no typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,A man in his nineties (index patient) had respiratory symptoms and dysgeusia, and was diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms.
NA,However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient.
NA,Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues.
NA,Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
NA,As a result of the 2019 novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) global spread, medical examiner/coroner offices will inevitably encounter increased numbers of COVID-19-infected decedents at autopsy.
NA,While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (e.g. cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms.
NA,Those dying with-but not of-COVID-19 may still be infectious, however.
NA,While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations.
NA,Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there are a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings.
NA,A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations.
NA,We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), in December 2019 in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, has developed into an unprecedented pandemic with enormous pressure on health-care providers around the world.
NA,A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals.
NA,Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate.
NA,Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic.
NA,This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study.
NA,We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020.
NA,All patients who were ≥65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort.
NA,In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected.
NA,In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included.
NA,Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively.
NA,The total mortality rate was 9.6%.
NA,Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive.
NA,The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days.
NA,The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested.
NA,Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died.
NA,Results differed among centers.
NA,There is a higher mortality rate in patients with a hip fracture and an associated positive test for COVID-19.
NA,Prognostic Level IV.
NA,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19) has produced an unprecedented global pandemic.
NA,Though the death rate from COVID-19 infection is ∼2%, many infected people recover at home.
NA,Among patients for whom COVID-19 is deadly are those with pre-existing comorbidities.
NA,Therefore, identification of populations at highest risk of COVID-19 mortality could significantly improve the capacity of healthcare providers to take early action and minimize the possibility of overwhelming care centers, which in turn would save many lives.
NA,Although several approaches have been used/developed (or are being developed/suggested) to diagnose COVID-19 infection, no approach is available/proposed for fast diagnosis of COVID-19 infections likely to be fatal.
NA,The central aim of this short perspective is to suggest a few possible nanobased technologies (i.e., protein corona sensor array and magnetic levitation) that could discriminate COVID-19-infected people while still in the early stages of infection who are at high risk of death.
NA,Such discrimination technologies would not only be useful in protecting health care centers from becoming overwhelmed but would also provide a powerful tool to better control possible future pandemics with a less social and economic burden.
NA,Respiratory pathogens, such as novel influenza A viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and now, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are of particular concern because of their high transmissibility and history of global spread (1).
NA,Clusters of severe respiratory disease are challenging to investigate, especially in resource-limited settings, and disease etiology often is not well understood.
NA,In 2014, endorsed by the Group of Seven (G7),* the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was established to help build country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.<sup>†</sup> GHSA is a multinational, multisectoral collaboration to support countries towards full implementation of the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR).<sup>§</sup> Initially, 11 technical areas for collaborator participation were identified to meet GHSA goals.
NA,CDC developed the Detection and Response to Respiratory Events (DaRRE) strategy in 2014 to enhance country capacity to identify and control respiratory disease outbreaks.
NA,DaRRE initiatives support the four of 11 GHSA technical areas that CDC focuses on: surveillance, laboratory capacity, emergency operations, and workforce development.<sup>¶</sup> In 2016, Kenya was selected to pilot DaRRE because of its existing respiratory disease surveillance and laboratory platforms and well-developed Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) (2).
NA,During 2016-2020, Kenya's DaRRE partners (CDC, the Kenya Ministry of Health [MoH], and Kenya's county public health officials) conceptualized, planned, and implemented key components of DaRRE.
NA,Activities were selected based on existing capacity and determined by the Kenya MoH and included 1) expansion of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance sites; 2) piloting of community event-based surveillance; 3) expansion of laboratory diagnostic capacity; 4) training of public health practitioners in detection, investigation, and response to respiratory threats; and 5) improvement of response capacity by the national emergency operations center (EOC).
NA,Progress on DaRRE activity implementation was assessed throughout the process.
NA,This pilot in Kenya demonstrated that DaRRE can support IHR requirements and can capitalize on a country's existing resources by tailoring tools to improve public health preparedness based on countries' needs.
NA,This study evaluated the significance of lymphocyte subsets detection in peripheral blood in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Our results revealed that CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients.
NA,COVID-19 patients had a relatively slight decrease in CD4+T cells but a severe decrease of CD8+T cells.
NA,The significantly elevated CD4/CD8 ratio was observed in COVID-19 patients.
NA,T cell subset counts were related to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
NA,The counts of CD8+T and CD4+T cells can be used as diagnostic markers of COVID-19 and predictors of disease severity.
NA,The outbreak of emerging infectious pneumonia caused by 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has posed an enormous threat to public health, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have made vast contribution to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) among Chinese population.
NA,As an indispensable part of TCM, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) are highly valued and critically acclaimed in their campaign to contain and tackle the epidemic, they can achieve considerable effects for both suspected cases under medical observation period, and confirmed individuals with serious underlying diseases or critical conditions.
NA,Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19.
NA,The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research.
NA,With regard to infected patients with different stages and syndrome, the preferable potentials and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs were addressed through the comprehensive collection of relevant literatures and on-going clinical trials.
NA,This study could provide an insight into clinical application and underlying mechanism of recommended CPMs against COVID-19, with the aim to share the Chinese experience in clinical practice and facilitate scientific development of TCM, especially CPMs in the fierce battle of COVID-19.
NA,This article aims at collecting all information needed for dentists regarding the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world by reviewing articles published by now.
NA,In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, China.
NA,There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly evolving into transmission from human to human.
NA,The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients' saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19.
NA,There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
NA,Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life.
NA,As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.
NA,• Clinical evaluation should guide those needing investigation • Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary • Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used • Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged • Patients with moderate and severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management • Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and social shielding is recommended • In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at three and six months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased • Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce investigations • When extensive differential diagnostic testing is not feasible, it should be deferred, and medical treatment should be initiated • Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery may be avoided during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence • Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared infection related to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
NA,The role and impact of imaging predates this declaration and continues to change rapidly.
NA,This article is a consensus statement provided by the Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology and the Canadian Association of Radiologists outlining the role of imaging in COVID-19 patients.
NA,The objectives are to answer key questions related to COVID-19 imaging of the chest and provide guidance for radiologists who are interpreting such studies during this pandemic.
NA,The role of chest radiography (CXR), computed tomography (CT), and lung ultrasound is discussed.
NA,This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as &quot;When is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?
NA,&quot; or &quot;How should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?
NA,&quot; This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided.
NA,Proposed reporting language is also outlined based on this structure.
NA,As our understanding of this pandemic evolves, our appreciation for how imaging fits into the workup of patients during this unprecedented time evolves as well.
NA,Although this consensus statement was written using the most recent literature, it is important to maintain an open mind as new information continues to surface.
NA,Despite initial findings indicating that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically related belonging to the same virus species and that the two viruses used the same entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), our data demonstrated that there is no detectable cross-neutralization by SARS patient sera against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We also found that there are significant levels of neutralizing antibodies in recovered SARS patients 9-17 years after initial infection.
NA,These findings will be of significant use in guiding the development of serologic tests, formulating convalescent plasma therapy strategies, and assessing the longevity of protective immunity for SARS-related coronaviruses in general as well as vaccine efficacy.
NA,Although typical and atypical CT image findings of COVID-19 are reported in current studies, the CT image features of COVID-19 overlap with those of viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.
NA,Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis.
NA,Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included.
NA,The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected.
NA,Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used.
NA,The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19).
NA,Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854.
NA,These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score &gt; 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score &gt; 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score &gt;  2.
NA,With a simple and practical scoring system based on CT imaging features, we can make a hierarchical diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 with different management suggestions.
NA,US hospitals are engaged in an infection control arms race.
NA,Hospitals, specialties, and professional groups are spurring one another on to adopt progressively more aggressive measures in response to COVID-19 that often exceed federal and international standards.
NA,Examples include universal masking of providers and patients; decreasing thresholds to test asymptomatic patients; using face shields and N95 respirators regardless of symptoms and test results; novel additions to the list of aerosol-generating procedures; and more comprehensive personal protective equipment including hair, shoe, and leg covers.
NA,Here, we review the factors underlying this arms race, including fears about personal safety, ongoing uncertainty around how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, confusion about what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure, increasing recognition of the importance of asymptomatic infection, and the limited accuracy of diagnostic tests.
NA,We consider the detrimental effects of a maximal infection control approach and the research studies that are needed to eventually de-escalate hospitals and to inform more evidence-based and measured strategies.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization.
NA,However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences.
NA,The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus.
NA,This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery.
NA,The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
NA,From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery departments, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2.
NA,There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years).
NA,All patients had co-morbidities.
NA,The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n=5), complex emergencies (n=5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n=3), gastroplasty (n=1), and stoma closure (n=1).
NA,The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days).
NA,In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
NA,At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were still hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.
NA,The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.
NA,Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.
NA,Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,However, overall similarities in the clinical presentation of these dermatological manifestations have not yet been summarized.
NA,This review aims to provide an overview of various cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 through three case reports and a literature review.
NA,A literature search was conducted using PubMed, OVID, and Google search engines for original and review articles.
NA,Studies written in the English language that mentioned cutaneous symptoms and COVID-19 were included.
NA,Eighteen articles and three additional cases reported in this paper were included in this review.
NA,Of these studies, 6 are case series and 12 are case report studies.
NA,The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26/72) patients.
NA,The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1/72).
NA,Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet.
NA,Skin lesion development occurred before the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days.
NA,Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions.
NA,Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.
NA,Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality.
NA,The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections.
NA,Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations.
NA,We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%.
NA,We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity.
NA,Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort.
NA,We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%.
NA,These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.
NA,We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought a new wave of challenges to health care, particularly in the area of rapid diagnostic test development and implementation.
NA,Acute diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is critically dependent on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs).
NA,While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays.
NA,In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA.
NA,Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting.
NA,Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests.
NA,Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the cause of a worldwide pandemic.
NA,Many commercial SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have received Emergency Use Authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration.
NA,However, there are limited data describing their performance, in particular the performance of high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR systems.
NA,We analyzed the diagnostic performance of two high-throughput systems: cobas 6800 and Panther Fusion, and their associated RT-PCR assays with a collection of 389 nasopharyngeal specimens.
NA,The overall percent agreement between the platforms was 96.4% (375/389).
NA,Cohen's kappa analysis rated the strength of agreement between the two platforms as &quot;almost perfect&quot; (κ = 0.922; standard error, 0.051).
NA,Furthermore, there was no significant difference between corresponding cycle threshold values generated on the two systems (<i>P</i> value = 0.88; Student's t test).
NA,Taken together, these data imply both platforms can be considered comparable in terms of their clinical performance.
NA,We believe this information will be useful for those who have already adopted these platforms or are seeking to implement high-throughput RT-PCR testing to stem the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,The majority of cases infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China centered in the city of Wuhan.
NA,Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures.
NA,This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan.
NA,We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR<sup>+Q</sup>).
NA,The SEIR<sup>+Q</sup> dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan.
NA,Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020.
NA,The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions.
NA,By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count.
NA,Effective reproductive number <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward.
NA,In conclusion, the proposed SEIR<sup>+Q</sup> dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.
NA,The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.
NA,An emerging viral infection is a global public health challenge.
NA,The development of modern, fast, and extensive transportation makes the outbreak hard to contain.
NA,Everyone is at risk, and the outbreak can rapidly turn into a pandemic crisis, like what we are currently facing for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,Prompt diagnosis of the case is required to improve patients' prognosis and control of the outbreak.
NA,The common manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, and malaise.
NA,However, patients may present with atypical symptoms that pose a diagnostic challenge.
NA,We report the first case of an elderly male who presented with rhabdomyolysis and later was diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,Clinicians should be aware that rhabdomyolysis can be an initial presentation of COVID-19 or can occur at any time during the disease course.
NA,Patients with rhabdomyolysis should receive aggressive fluid administration to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI).
NA,However, COVID-19 patients are at risk of worsening oxygenation and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from fluid overload.
NA,Therefore, cautious fluid administration is needed in COVID-19 patients with rhabdomyolysis.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, a novel ß-coronavirus, cause severe pneumonia and has spread throughout the globe rapidly.
NA,The disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is named COVID-19.
NA,To date, real-time RT-PCR is the only test able to confirm this infection.
NA,However, the accuracy of RT-PCR depends on several factors; variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of detection.
NA,Here, we developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay that detected immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM.
NA,The assay cut-off value was determined by evaluating the sera from healthy and infected patients for pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2.
NA,To evaluate assay performance, we detected IgG and IgM in the sera from confirmed patients.
NA,The positive rate of IgG and IgM was 71.4% and 57.2%, respectively.
NA,Therefore, combining our immunoassay with real-time RT-PCR might enhance the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19.
NA,We report a case series of 6 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wakayama prefecture, Japan.
NA,All 6 of the patients tested positive in pharyngeal swab PCR tests, and 2 of the 6 were still positive at 3 weeks after onset.
NA,All of the patients exhibited bilateral ground glass opacities (GGO) on computed tomography (CT).
NA,This paper also reports narrative information on the spectrum of symptoms collected directly from the patients.
NA,It would be difficult to triage patients with COVID-19 based on the typical symptoms of fever and/or cough, although PCR and CT are definitive in diagnosis.
NA,The urgent need to implement and rapidly expand testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to the development of multiple assays.
NA,How these tests perform relative to one another is poorly understood.
NA,We evaluated the concordance between the Roche Diagnostics cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test and a laboratory-developed test (LDT) real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples submitted to the Clinical Laboratories of the Mount Sinai Health System.
NA,A total of 1006 nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium from persons under investigation were tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine clinical care using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test with subsequent evaluation by the LDT.
NA,Cycle threshold values were analyzed and interpreted as either positive (&quot;detected&quot; or &quot;presumptive positive&quot;), negative (not detected), inconclusive, or invalid.
NA,Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.
NA,The cobas SARS-CoV-2 test reported 706 positive and 300 negative results.
NA,The LDT reported 640 positive, 323 negative, 34 inconclusive, and 9 invalid results.
NA,When excluding inconclusive and invalid results, the overall percent agreement between the two platforms was 95.8%.
NA,Cohen's κ coefficient was 0.904 (95% confidence interval, 0.875-0.933), suggesting almost perfect agreement between both platforms.
NA,An overall discordance rate of 4.2% between the two systems may reflect differences in primer sequences, assay limit of detection, or other factors, highlighting the importance of comparing the performance of different testing platforms.
NA,To face the new Covid-19 pandemic, the need for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease among suspected cases quickly became obvious for effective management, and for better control of the spread of the disease in the population.
NA,Since the beginning of this disease epidemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has routinely been used to confirm diagnosis.
NA,However, several authors have pointed out the poor performance of this technique, particularly in terms of sensitivity.<sup>1,2</sup> This article is protected by copyright.

NA,The micro-neutralization assay is a fundamental test in virology, immunology, vaccine assessment, and epidemiology studies.
NA,Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of December 2019 in China, it has become extremely important to have well-established and validated diagnostic and serological assays for this new emerging virus.
NA,Here, we present a micro-neutralization assay with the use of SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus with two different methods of read-out.
NA,We evaluated the performance of this assay using human serum samples taken from an Italian seroepidemiological study being performed at the University of Siena, along with the human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and some iper-immune animal serum samples against Influenza and Adenovirus strains.
NA,The same panel of human samples have been previously tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a pre-screening.
NA,Positive, borderline, and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different methods of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer).
NA,Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner.
NA,Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.
NA,Initially, acute loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) was not considered important symptoms for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,To determine the prevalence of these symptoms and to evaluate their diagnostic significance, we (approximately 150 physicians of the Daegu Medical Association) prospectively collected data of cases of anosmia and ageusia from March 8, 2020, via telephone interview among 3,191 patients in Daegu, Korea.
NA,Acute anosmia or ageusia was observed in 15.3% (488/3,191) patients in the early stage of COVID-19 and in 15.7% (367/2,342) patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity.
NA,Their prevalence was significantly more common among females and younger individuals (<i>P</i> = 0.01 and <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively).
NA,Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks.
NA,The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms.
NA,Anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of the disease.
NA,We prospectively assessed 49 coronavirus disease cases in Guangdong, China, to estimate the frequency and duration of detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in human body fluids.
NA,The prolonged persistence of virus RNA in various body fluids may guide the clinical diagnosis and prevention of onward virus transmission.
NA,Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifests with a wide spectrum of presentations.
NA,Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019.
NA,We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19.
NA,Brief report.
NA,A university hospital in Saudi Arabia.
NA,A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever.
NA,The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up.
NA,Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.
NA,The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.
NA,<b>Context:</b> The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is significantly changing methodological approaches in all branches of the health system.
NA,From a forensic point of view, this event is partly changing the manner in which forensic pathologists and all those who work in autopsy services operate, but above all, it is changing the patterns established for years by which cadavers were analysed <i>postmortem</i>. <b>Objective:</b> To present a review of the literature and a proposal for COVID autopsy protocols.
NA,To contain the infection risk, a revision of all the protocols that until now have been applied to the examination of bodies that require autopsy services is required. <b>Data source:</b> Currently, the diagnosis and <i>postmortem</i> analysis of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases plays a crucial role in scientific research.
NA,A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy has been carried out.
NA,Scientific papers currently available via the <i>PubMed NCBI</i> search engine on COVID-19 <i>postmortem</i> diagnosis were also examined. <b>Discussion:</b> Throughout the history of medicine, the role of autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated <i>postmortem</i> through autopsy.
NA,The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.
NA,Background Chest radiography (CXR) may play an important role in triage for COVID-19, particularly in low-resource settings.
NA,Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs.
NA,Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-Xray) was trained on 24,678 CXR images including 1,540 used only for validation while training.
NA,The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired CXR images (n=454) obtained in patients suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4th and April 6th 2020 in a single center (223 RT-PCR positive subjects, 231 RT-PCR negative subjects).
NA,The radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system.
NA,Diagnostic performance was performed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
NA,Results For the test set, the mean age of the patients was 67.3 (+/-14.4) years (56% male).
NA,Using RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified CXR images as COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.81.
NA,The system significantly outperforms each reader (p &lt; 0.001 using McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities.
NA,At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader can significantly outperform the AI system (p=0.04).
NA,Conclusions An AI system for detection of COVID-19 on chest radiographs was comparable to six independent readers.
NA,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has spread to almost every country with more than three million confirmed cases and over two hundred thousand deaths as of April 28, 2020.
NA,Rapid first-line testing protocols are needed for outbreak control and surveillance.
NA,We used computational and manual design to generate a suitable set of reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) primer and exonuclease probe, internally quenched (exo-IQ) probe sequences targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.
NA,RT-RPA sensitivity was determined by amplification of in vitro transcribed RNA standards.
NA,Assay selectivity was demonstrated with a selectivity panel of 32 nucleic acid samples derived from common respiratory viruses.
NA,To validate the assay against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total viral RNA derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 positive and 11 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were screened.
NA,All results were compared to established RT-qPCR assays.
NA,The 95% detection probability of the RT-RPA assay was determined to be 7.74 (95% CI: 2.87 - 27.39) RNA copies per reaction.
NA,The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance.
NA,The developed RT-RPA assay produced 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to RT-qPCR (n=20).
NA,With a run time of 15 to 20 minutes and first results being available in under 7 minutes for high RNA concentrations, the reported assay constitutes one of the fastest nucleic acid based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to date and may provide a simple to use alternative to RT-qPCR for first-line screening at the point of need.
NA,The COVID-19 situation has seen the cessation of all non-urgent dental care in the UK.
NA,Regular practice activity has come to a virtual standstill and the dental industry has seen a very significant reduction in its provision of products and services.
NA,There are differing government financial mitigations in place across dental practices for NHS and, to an extent private, activity, as well as for the dental industry.
NA,Dentistry is generally classified in the very high-risk category of aerosol production through many aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
NA,To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved.
NA,From a dental industry perspective, equipment and product manufacturers and suppliers are building upon, and further developing, the industry's extremely close relationship and partnership with the dental profession, in order to develop and implement new ways of thinking and new approaches, products and techniques to protect patients and clinicians, focusing on a return to the more widespread provision of dentistry.
NA,To analyse clinical and radiological changes from disease onset to exacerbation in coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) patients.
NA,We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia.
NA,Twenty-four patients were included.
NA,Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities.
NA,Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9 ± 88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2-5) and total CT score was 6 (2-8).
NA,Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p &lt; 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p &lt; 0.01).
NA,The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5-5) and 12 (9-14), respectively.
NA,Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively.
NA,CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation.
NA,There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation.
NA,An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes.
NA,Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis.
NA,• The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions.
NA,• An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome.
NA,• Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that appeared in China in December 2019 and spread globally, evolving into the currently observed pandemic.
NA,The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and imaging cannot replace genetic testing in patients suspected of COVID-19.
NA,However, with predominant respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases, chest imaging using computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in detecting viral lung infection, evaluating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions, and monitoring the disease activity.
NA,The role of chest CT as a diagnostic tool may be increased when the laboratory testing capacities using RT-PCR prove inaccurate or insufficient during a major outbreak of the disease.
NA,In these settings, a rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 potentially offered by CT might be an advantage, in addition to obvious benefits of delineating the nature and extent of pulmonary changes.
NA,In the present paper, we reviewed the diagnostic role of chest CT in COVID-19 patients.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is serious and there is no effective treatment to date.
NA,In order to reduce the mortality of severe and critical COVID-19, experts from the first-line in related fields in China were organized to analyze, discuss and summarize the diagnosis and treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and other severe epidemic areas, and formulate the expert consensus.
NA,The first edition was released on February 22, 2020, and the revised one on March 4, 2020.
NA,To discuss the research progress in the field of coronavirus (CoVs) treatment based on the visualization analysis of knowledge graph.
NA,The related literatures in the field of CoVs treatment were retrieved from the establishment of Web of Science core collection database to February 15th, 2020, and the literature analysis tool of Web of Science database was used to count the annual trend of published literatures.
NA,The VOSviewer software was used to analyze the relationship among countries, institutions, authors, clustering and density of subject words.
NA,The HistCite software was used to screen important documents and to draw the evolution process of hot spots.
NA,The CiteSpace software was used to analyze the breakout points of subject words, so as to find the front and hot spots in this field.
NA,A total of 1 747 data were retrieved, with the exception of 17 duplicate data, and 1 730 data were retained for visualization analysis.
NA,In terms of literature volume, the literatures on CoVs therapy rose after 2003 and 2012, and the number of published literatures had remained high since 2014.
NA,In terms of countries, the main countries that carried out the research on the treatment of CoVs were the United States (n = 613), China (n = 582), Germany (n = 122), Canada (n = 99), etc., and the cooperation among countries was close.
NA,In terms of institutions, the number of papers issued by Chinese Academy of Sciences in the field of CoVs treatment ranked first (n = 82), followed by University of Hong Kong of China (n = 74) and Chinese University of Hong Kong of China (n = 58), followed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (n = 37), and the cooperation among various institutions was close.
NA,In terms of literature authors, there were two high-yielding authors in the United States [Ralph S.
NA,Baric (n = 21) and Kuochen Chou (n = 17)], two Chinese authors [Yuen Kwok-yung (n = 17) and Jiang Shibo (n = 16)] and one Dutch author [Eric J.

NA,Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world.
NA,Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process.
NA,Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease.
NA,In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images.
NA,To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability.
NA,Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia.
NA,In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes.
NA,Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.
NA,We have read with great interest the articles regarding cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.
NA,Studies showed 20.4% of COVID-19 patients developed cutaneous manifestations and might be the only presenting symptom.(
NA,1) To date, previous cases reported urticaria as one of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19.(
NA,2)(1)(3)(4) This atypical symptom might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and virus transmission, especially in countries where cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported widely such as in Indonesia.
NA,We would like to report a case of urticaria in COVID-19-positive non-ICU hospitalized patient from Indonesia to bring awareness to its cutaneous manifestations.
NA,COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe.
NA,No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
NA,Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway.
NA,There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19.
NA,We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials.
NA,We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available.
NA,Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment.
NA,We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an &quot;active&quot; comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or &quot;active placebo&quot;) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19.

NA,CT scan is required before considering emergency surgery for acute appendicitis.
NA,Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of COVID-19-related myocarditis cases have been reported.
NA,The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response.
NA,COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience.
NA,The clinical findings include changes in ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function.
NA,When cardiac MRI is infeasible, cardiac CT angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns.
NA,Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered.
NA,Where the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.
NA,Arrhythmias are not uncommon in the COVID-19 patients; however, its pathophysiology is still speculative.
NA,Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatments.
NA,The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including in the majority of mild cases remains unknown.
NA,A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019.

NA,In this review, we describe some currently applied diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, to prevent, treat and control further outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus.
NA,Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics.
NA,Additionally, general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting COVID-19 are addressed.
NA,This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed.
NA,It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.
NA,Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main protease (Mpro) is available.
NA,The reported structure of the target Mpro was described in this review to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using virtual high throughput screening.
NA,In France, the combination hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) is used in the treatment of COVID-19.
NA,We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days).
NA,Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and &gt;10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (&gt;10 days).
NA,A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years - range 14-95 years).
NA,Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%).
NA,Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p &lt; .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10.
NA,All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15.
NA,A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74-95 years old).
NA,All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity.
NA,Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far).
NA,PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration.
NA,PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p &lt; .05).
NA,A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision).
NA,Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients.
NA,Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to ACE2 and on S protein priming by TMPRSS2.
NA,Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene.
NA,First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2.
NA,Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).
NA,There were 9280 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Veneto on April 1, 2020.
NA,Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females.
NA,Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 Million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59).
NA,A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40).
NA,Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections than non-cancer patients.
NA,However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting 2.7 million individuals globally as of April 25, 2020, with more than 187,000 deaths.
NA,An increasing body of evidence has supported central nervous system involvement.
NA,We conducted a review of the reported data for studies concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines.
NA,Central nervous system manifestations range from vague nonfocal complaints to severe neurological impairment associated with encephalitis.
NA,It is unclear whether the neurological dysfunction results from direct viral injury or systemic disease.
NA,The virus could affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction, in addition to direct pulmonary injury.
NA,Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of the ongoing scientific and clinical findings.
NA,The present review has consolidated the current body of data regarding the neurological impact of coronaviruses, discussed the reported neurological manifestations of COVID-19, and highlighted the recommendations for patient management.
NA,Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons have also been provided.
NA,The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a public health emergency that had caused disastrous results in more than 100 countries.
NA,The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention.
NA,With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance.
NA,The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data.
NA,The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk.
NA,Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas.
NA,However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations.
NA,We evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients.
NA,The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test.
NA,Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission.
NA,Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and &gt;2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively.
NA,Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM.
NA,Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG.
NA,The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.
NA,The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19.
NA,If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.
NA,In many countries around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in health services being diverted to manage patients with the condition.
NA,There are situations however that still require the undertaking of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) with potentially high exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission through droplet, contact and possibly airborne routes.
NA,The objective of this paper is to explore a structured way for the operative team to approach AGP to reduce aerosolisation of secretions, decrease open airway time and minimise staff exposure.
NA,The authors (otolaryngologists, anaesthetists and nursing staff) created a unified operative team checklist based on collation of national and international specialty society statements, local state government recommendations, hospital policies and literature review.
NA,Simulation was undertaken and the checklist was refined after performing AGP on patients with unknown (presumed positive) COVID-19 status.
NA,An 8 step operative team checklist is provided describing details for the immediate pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative journey of the patient to encourage healthcare workers to reflect upon and modify usual practice during AGP to mitigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes or retrieval of an inhaled airway foreign body is used to illustrate the steps however the checklist structure is modifiable for other AGP and adaptable for local needs.
NA,At a time of overwhelming and changing information and recommendations, an operative team checklist may provide some structure to healthcare workers undertaking AGP to reduce anxiety, maintain focus, prompt consideration of alternatives and potentially reduce risk.
NA,So far, one of the major drawbacks of the available molecular assays for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the need for viral nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens.
NA,The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required.
NA,The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9-3.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2-1.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9-3.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2-1.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab.
NA,The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL.
NA,Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay.
NA,Clinical performances of Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method.
NA,Concordance analysis showed an &quot;almost perfect&quot; agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being κ = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980.
NA,The high sensitivity and specificity of this new assay indicate that it is promising for laboratory diagnosis, enabling highspeed detection in just over one hour, which is significantly faster than the up to five hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.
NA,The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a unique challenge for diagnostic laboratories around the world.
NA,Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid testing for highly urgent cases.
NA,In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR.
NA,A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system.
NA,Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab.
NA,The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/mL and no false positives during evaluation of cross-reactivity.
NA,A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay.
NA,Positive and negative agreement were 100 % and 99.2 % respectively.
NA,Invalid-rate was 6.3 %.
NA,The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay.
NA,Due to its random-access workflow concept and rapid time-to-result of about 80 min, the system is very well suited for providing fast-tracked SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting.
NA,In December 2019, coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
NA,The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions.
NA,To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020.
NA,From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
NA,There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years.
NA,Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak.
NA,Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province.
NA,These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)].
NA,Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)].
NA,The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection.
NA,Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly.
NA,Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients.
NA,CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %).
NA,Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea.
NA,Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients.
NA,And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area.
NA,For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results.
NA,Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.
NA,The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia.
NA,Hospitals have been forced to reorganized their units in response to prepare for an unforeseen healthcare emergency.
NA,In this context, our laboratory (Molecular and Genomic Diagnostics Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS) re-modulated its priorities by temporarily interrupting most of the molecular tests guaranteeing only those considered &quot;urgent&quot; and not postponable.
NA,In particular, this paper details changes regarding the execution of germline BRCA (gBRCA) testing in our laboratory.
NA,A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset.
NA,The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists.
NA,These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology.
NA,Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.
NA,The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders.
NA,The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic.
NA,We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine.
NA,In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder.
NA,All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission.
NA,We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time.
NA,Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.
NA,The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population.
NA,Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable.
NA,We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology.
NA,The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020.
NA,It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes.
NA,It is an online registry.
NA,Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient.
NA,As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities.
NA,The most represented form of RRT is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients.
NA,Symptoms are similar to the general population.
NA,A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units.
NA,The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids.
NA,Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids.
NA,Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak may profoundly impact population mental health because of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress.
NA,An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted.
NA,Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence.
NA,We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis.
NA,Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria.
NA,Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%.
NA,Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress.
NA,Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging.
NA,Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted.
NA,How to support adherence to physical distancing requirements and engagement with services in patients with existing psychosis requires careful consideration.
NA,Registration details: https://osf.io/29pm4.
NA,In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, there is a growing need and demand for diagnostic tools that are complementary and different from the RT-PCR currently in use.
NA,Multiple serological tests are or will be very soon available but need to be evaluated and validated.
NA,We have thus tested 4 immunochromatographic tests for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR.
NA,We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset.
NA,The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers.
NA,All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15.
NA,In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections.
NA,Thus, immunochromatographic tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have their place for the diagnostic panel of COVID-19.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the epithelium of the airways.
NA,With the increasing involvement of dermatologist in management of this crisis, cutaneous symptoms gained more and more attention.
NA,In this review, we will describe cutaneous symptoms of patients of all ages in association with COVID-19.
NA,We will focus on such disorders that are caused by direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on tissues, complement, and coagulation system and on nonspecific eruption of the systemic viral infection.
NA,Drug-induced reactions are only mentioned in the differential diagnoses.
NA,Although more systematic investigations are warranted, it becomes clear that some symptoms are clinical signs of a milder COVID-19 course, while others are a red flag for a more severe course.
NA,Knowledge of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 may help in early diagnosis, triage of patients, and risk stratification.
NA,On 21 February 2020, 'Luigi Sacco' Hospital was identified as a Covid-19 referral Hospital in Lombardy.
NA,The Department of Urology of our Healthcare Institution consists of two Urology Units, one at 'L.Sacco' Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Covid-19 hospital) and one at 'Fatebenefratelli' Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Covid-19-free hospital).
NA,The Healthcare System's Administration communicated to all personnel the implementation of a planned 'biological risk protocol' at the Covid-19 hospital, while the Covid-19-free hospital followed regular government recommendations.
NA,We evaluated the risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients treated for surgical or invasive urologic procedures during the epidemic in the two different hospitals.
NA,At the Covid-19 hospital, 12 patients underwent surgery and 51 patients invasive diagnostic procedures between 22 February and 8 March 2020; in the same period, at the Covid-19-free hospital, 21 patients underwent surgery and 56 patients invasive diagnostic procedures.
NA,We compared the incidence of Sars-Cov-2 infection among the patients who were accessed in the two Urology Units in the period of different restrictive measures after the outbreak of the epidemic.
NA,We registered no cases of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients hospitalized in that period in Covid-19 hospital, despite three cases of swab positivity in the Covid-19-free hospital.
NA,The early implementation of extraordinary measures to restrict the spread of the virus offers a good protection also in a Covid-19 referral Hospital.
NA,The adoption of safety measures may be considered even after the end of the pandemic in all the health systems.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures to mitigate it have presented the world with certain unprecedented situations.
NA,Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure.
NA,Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis, prescription and follow up evaluation.
NA,Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals.
NA,Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario.
NA,A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers.
NA,Within its limitations related to the quality and quantity of information sought, this comes as a viable method of patient -physician interfacing during the phase of lockdown.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has spread rapidly, resulting in a worldwide pandemic.
NA,Even though end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and can develop severe to critical disease, there are limited studies and case reports about COVID-19 in ESRD patients.
NA,We report a case of a 63-year-old gentleman with ESRD on regular hemodialysis.
NA,We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment.
NA,He positively responded to a 14-day course of Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Ribavirin, Azithromycin, and Hydroxychloroquine.
NA,Precision medicine (PM) represents a new paradigm in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
NA,To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management.
NA,The identification of the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had led to a plethora of strategies to contain viral dissemination, affecting life styles and personal behaviors.
NA,Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor.
NA,Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases.
NA,Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) were increased in severe patients.
NA,These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation.
NA,Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out.
NA,Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.
NA,The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with COVID-19.
NA,A systematic search of the literature across nine databases was conducted from inception until 15th March 2020, following the PRISMA guidelines.
NA,Patients with a validated diagnosis of COVID-19 and using corticosteroids were included, considering all health outcomes.
NA,Four studies with 542 Chinese participants were included.
NA,Two studies reported negative findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, i.e., corticosteroids had a detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
NA,One study reported no significant association between the use of corticosteroids and clinical outcomes.
NA,However, one study, on 201 participants with different stages of pneumonia due to COVID-19, found that in more severe forms, the administration of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the risk of death by 62%.
NA,The literature to date does not fully support the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19, but some findings suggest that methylprednisolone could lower mortality rate in more severe forms of the condition.
NA,In response to the global call for strategic information to understand the novel coronavirus, the dataset presented in this paper is an examination of COVID-19-related knowledge, risk perceptions and precautionary health behavior among Nigerians.
NA,The data were generated during the COVID-19 lockdown in the country through a survey distributed via an online questionnaire, assessing socio-demographic information (7 items), knowledge (5 items), information sources (1 item), risk perception (9 items), expected end of lockdown (1 item), and COVID-19 precautionary health behavior (10 items), from 28th March to 4th April, 2020, gathering a total of 1,357 responses.
NA,A combination of purposive and snowball techniques helped to select the respondents via Whatsapp and Facebook from 180 cities/towns in the 6 geopolitical zones of Nigeria.
NA,The survey data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
NA,The entire dataset is stored in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet (xlsx) and the questionnaire is attached as a supplementary file.
NA,The data will assist in curbing the Coronavirus pandemic by offering evidence for strategic and targeted interventions as well as health policy formulations and implementation.
NA,Since the first reports of the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease (COVID-19), concerns remain about whether the virus is transmissible in pregnant women from the mother to the fetus during either the antepartum period or the process of labor and delivery.
NA,One recent review reported that in a small number of cases, two PCR swabs of the placenta were sent in additional to neonatal and cord blood testing, and both placental PCR swabs were negative.<sup>1</sup> Other studies have demonstrated the finding of SARS-CoV2 IgM in neonates born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy,<sup>2,3</sup> findings that may indicate vertical transmission of the virus in utero.
NA,We report our experience with placental/membrane SARS-CoV2 RNA PCR swab results after delivery to a series of symptomatic mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy.
NA,IRB approval was obtained.
NA,All pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who gave birth between March 1, 2020 and April 20, 2020 at NYU Langone Health were identified by a search of the electronic medical record.
NA,Charts were reviewed for documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing sent from either the placenta or membranes within 30 minutes following delivery.
NA,PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 was performed using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress assay.
NA,Placental swabs were obtained from the amniotic surface after clearing the surface of maternal blood (placental PCR).
NA,Membrane swabs were obtained from between the amnion and chorion after manual separation of the membranes (membrane PCR).
NA,Maternal COVID-19 illness was categorized as mild, severe, or critical.<sup>4</sup> The time interval from maternal diagnosis of COVID-19 to delivery was calculated in days.
NA,Infants were tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR between days of life 1 and 5 while hospitalized.
NA,Hospitalized infants were also assessed for clinical signs and symptoms, including fever, cough, and nasal congestion.
NA,Of 32 COVID-19 positive pregnant patients who gave birth in this timeframe, placental or membrane swabs were sent from 11 patients (Table).
NA,Three of 11 swabs were positive.
NA,None of the infants tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on days of life 1 through 5, and none demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
NA,Of 11 placental or membrane swabs sent following delivery, 3 swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, all in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness at time of delivery.
NA,This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in placental or membrane samples.
NA,While there were no clinical signs of vertical transmission, our findings raise the possibility of intrapartum viral exposure.
NA,Given the mixing of maternal and fetal fluid and tissue at time of delivery, the origin of the detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our series is unclear.
NA,It may represent contamination from maternal blood, amniotic fluid, or COVID-19 infection of the membranes and amniotic sac.
NA,For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.<sup>5,6</sup>Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission.
NA,Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive.
NA,In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic.
NA,All people including children are generally susceptible to COVID-19, but the condition is relatively mild for children.
NA,The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples.
NA,The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infections.
NA,Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
NA,The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.
NA,For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.
NA,The current epidemic situation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still remained severe.
NA,As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province.
NA,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
NA,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance.
NA,Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect.
NA,The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making.
NA,Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results.
NA,Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10%patients' blood samples at acute period and 50%of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces.
NA,We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifying cytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system.
NA,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; strategy effectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality.
NA,Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19.
NA,Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms.
NA,The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.
NA,For cases of severe illness, early and also short period of moderate glucocorticoid was supported.
NA,Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center.
NA,Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended.
NA,Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies.
NA,Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased probiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, so nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation.
NA,Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Therefore,we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis.
NA,We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
NA,We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
NA,It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
NA,Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
NA,However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
NA,Severe and critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were usually with underlying diseases, which led to the problems of complicated drug use, potential drug-drug interactions and medication errors in special patients.
NA,Based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia</i> (<i>trial version</i> 6), and <i>Management of COVID</i>-19: <i>the Zhejiang experience</i>, we summarized the experience in the use of antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, vascular active drugs, antibacterial, probiotics, nutrition support schemes in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients.
NA,It is also suggested to focus on medication management for evaluation of drug efficacy and duration of treatment, prevention and treatment of adverse drug reactions, identification of potential drug-drug interactions, individualized medication monitoring based on biosafety protection, and medication administration for special patients.
NA,To compare the diagnostic efficacy among three RT-PCR test kits for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid detection.
NA,The throat swab samples from 40 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 16 hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients were recruited.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in throat swab samples with RT-PCR test kits from Sansure Biotech (&quot;Sansure&quot; for short), Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies (&quot;Bioperfectus&quot; for short) and BGI Genomics (&quot;BGI&quot; for short).
NA,The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Kappa value were analyzed.
NA,The viral nucleic acid was extracted from the throat swab samples by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods, and the efficacy of two extraction methods was also compared.
NA,The results of magnetic bead method for nucleic acid extraction by two different extractors (Sansure Natch CS S12C Fully Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System vs.
NA,Tianlong NP968-C Nucleic Acid Extractor) were also compared.
NA,The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and kappa value were 95.00%, 87.50%, 95.00%, 87.50%and 0.825 for Sansure kit; 90.00%, 87.50%, 94.74%, 77.78%and 0.747 for the Bioperfectus kit, and 82.50%, 81.25%, 91.67%, 65.00%and 0.593 for the BGI kit, respectively.
NA,The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods were 95.24%, 100.00%, 96.43%and 0.909, respectively, but the one-step cleavage method took only 25 min, while the magnetic bead method required 180 min.
NA,The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by the two different nucleic acid extractors were 85.00%, 100.00%, 89.29% and 0.764, respectively.
NA,The detection efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by the Sansure kit is relatively higher and the one-step cleavage method has advantages of convenient operation and less time consuming.
NA,To investigate the CT findings of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were collected and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical stages based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 6)</i>.
NA,The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types.
NA,Among 67 patients, 3(4.5%) were mild, 35 (52.2%) were moderate, 22 (32.8%) were severe, and 7(10.4%) were critical ill.
NA,No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients.
NA,The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions.
NA,CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
NA,Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.
NA,CT images of patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
NA,To analyze the roles of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
NA,In the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded.
NA,Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7±3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3±0.6) times.
NA,With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
NA,Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged.
NA,There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization.
NA,There were no deaths and no medical staff infections.
NA,The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.
NA,Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques.
NA,To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance.
NA,It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC.
NA,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
NA,Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
NA,Secondly, an initial ow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
NA,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
NA,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
NA,The current guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of primary respiratory infections are still useful during the COVID-19 epidemic.Telephone triage of patients with respiratory complaints aims to identify patients with complications or an increased risk of complications.There are no indications to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus in general practice.During this COVID-19 epidemic, protective clothing is recommended in all physical contacts with patients with respiratory complaints.There is no reason to be cautious about using NSAIDs in patients suspected of COVID-19.
NA,Amoxicillin is first choice treatment for respiratory infections during the COVID-19 epidemic; there is lack of evidence to support azithromycin as a first choice.Respiratory rate &gt; 24 / min or saturation &lt;92-94% indicate imminent respiratory decompensation and may be reasons for referral.
NA,Hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, has been considered as a possible therapeutic agent for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events.
NA,To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region.
NA,Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020.
NA,Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records.
NA,The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020.
NA,Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither.
NA,Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
NA,Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation).
NA,Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate &gt;22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L.
NA,Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%).
NA,The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]).
NA,In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]).
NA,In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), .
NA,In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings.
NA,Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
NA,However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the application of pulmonary ultrasound in the diagnosis of neonatal COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> In this retrospective study, the clinical data of 5 infants, who were admitted to the Department of Neonatology in Wuhan Children's Hospital from 31(st) January to 25(th) February 2020, were collected.
NA,Bedsides pulmondary ultrasound was conducted on admission, during the hospitalization, and before discharge, the result were compared with the chest X-ray or CT done at the same time. <b>Results:</b> Among the 5 cases who aged 1-18 days, 3 were male.
NA,The main clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,The pulmonary ultrasonography on admission showed abnormal pleural line and pulmonary edema of different severity in all 5 cases, presented as increase and fusion of B-line, and pulmonary interstitial syndrome; among them, one case also had a small-range consolidation.
NA,The chest CT on admission showed no obvious parenchymal infiltration in 2 cases, small strip or patchy high-density shadow in 2 cases, and ground glass change in one case.
NA,The re-examination of ultrosound during the hospitalization and at discharge showed improvement in all cases and were consistent with the chest X-ray taken at the same time. <b>Conclusions:</b> The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and alveolar interstitial syndrome, and may coexist with small range of pulmonary consolidation.
NA,The sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound is higher than that of chest X-ray and CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, and could be used in monitoring and evaluation of the disease. <b>目的：</b> 探讨肺部超声在新生儿新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）诊断中的应用。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 对2020年1月31日至2月25日武汉儿童医院新生儿内科收治的5例COVID-19新生儿进行回顾性病例总结，归纳其临床资料，在入院时、病程中、出院前进行床边肺部超声检查，并与同期胸部X线片或肺部CT结果对比，观察不同检查结果间的差异。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 5例患儿中男3例，年龄1~18日龄，临床表现主要为呼吸道和消化道症状。

NA,肺部超声在对肺水肿的检测上，敏感度优于胸部X线和肺部CT检查，并可对病程经过进行监测及评估。.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread over 210 countries and territories beyond China shortly.
NA,On February 29, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) denoted it in a high-risk category, and on March 11, 2020, this virus was designated pandemic, after its declaration being a Public Health International Emergency on January 30, 2020.
NA,World over high efforts are being made to counter and contain this virus.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak once again proves the potential of the animal-human interface to act as the primary source of emerging zoonotic diseases.
NA,Even though the circumstantial evidence suggests the possibility of an initial zoonotic emergence, it is too early to confirm the role of intermediate hosts such as snakes, pangolins, turtles, and other wild animals in the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to bats, the natural hosts of multiple coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
NA,The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited to retort this virus.
NA,Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies.
NA,Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This review discusses in brief about the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the role of animals, the veterinary and associated zoonotic links along with prevention and control strategies based on One-health approaches.
NA,Many healthcare workers were infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early in the epidemic posing a big challenge for epidemic control.
NA,Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers.
NA,This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study.
NA,We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020.
NA,All participants completed a validated questionnaire.
NA,Electronic consent was obtained from all participants.
NA,Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.
NA,Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%).
NA,Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment.
NA,Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively.
NA,Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves).
NA,The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
NA,After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
NA,Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.
NA,The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
NA,Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
NA,Platelets are anucleate cells in blood whose principal function is to stop bleeding by forming aggregates for hemostatic reactions.
NA,In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis.
NA,The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify.
NA,Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type.
NA,It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.
NA,The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.
NA,Platelets are small cells in the blood that primarily help stop bleeding after an injury by sticking together with other blood cells to form a clot that seals the broken blood vessel.
NA,Blood clots, however, can sometimes cause harm.
NA,For example, if a clot blocks the blood flow to the heart or the brain, it can result in a heart attack or stroke, respectively.
NA,Blood clots have also been linked to harmful inflammation and the spread of cancer, and there are now preliminary reports of remarkably high rates of clotting in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units.
NA,A variety of chemicals can cause platelets to stick together.
NA,It has long been assumed that it would be impossible to tell apart the clots formed by different chemicals (which are also known as agonists).
NA,This is largely because these aggregates all look very similar under a microscope, making it incredibly time consuming for someone to look at enough microscopy images to reliably identify the subtle differences between them.
NA,However, finding a way to distinguish the different types of platelet aggregates could lead to better ways to diagnose or treat blood vessel-clogging diseases.
NA,To make this possible, Zhou, Yasumoto et al. have developed a method called the “intelligent platelet aggregate classifier” or iPAC for short.
NA,First, numerous clot-causing chemicals were added to separate samples of platelets taken from healthy human blood.
NA,The method then involved using high-throughput techniques to take thousands of images of these samples.
NA,Then, a sophisticated computer algorithm called a deep learning model analyzed the resulting image dataset and “learned” to distinguish the chemical causes of the platelet aggregates based on subtle differences in their shapes.
NA,Finally, Zhou, Yasumoto et al. verified iPAC method’s accuracy using a new set of human platelet samples.
NA,The iPAC method may help scientists studying the steps that lead to clot formation.
NA,It may also help clinicians distinguish which clot-causing chemical led to a patient’s heart attack or stroke.
NA,This could help them choose whether aspirin or another anti-platelet drug would be the best treatment.
NA,But first more studies are needed to confirm whether this method is a useful tool for drug selection or diagnosis.
NA,It is now well established that non-communicable diseases (NCD), like diabetes mellitus, hypertension,, respiratory and heart disease, particularly among the elderly, increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 disease.
NA,Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities.
NA,However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients.
NA,Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs.
NA,The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic.
NA,In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications.
NA,In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.
NA,Keywords: Covid-19, NCDs, Medical ethics, epidemic, India.
NA,A new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading worldwide and causes pneumonia, respiratory distress, thromboembolic events, and death.
NA,Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, monitoring disease progression, determination of disease severity, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy.
NA,Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic.
NA,Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provide close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease.
NA,Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Herein we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion.
NA,Researchers predict that the negative effects of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will continue to increase.
NA,These negative effects are not solely limited to psycho-pathological problems.
NA,Serious physiological, social, and economical difficulties due to COVID-19 have already been observed in various nations.
NA,In this study, we suggest a new type of specific phobia, which may be categorized under DSM-V 300.29.
NA,The current study developed a self-report instrument whose items address the specific phobia diagnosis criteria of the DSM-V and tested its initial psychometric properties.
NA,Results show that the scale has initial evidence of construct, convergent, and discriminant validity, and internal consistency reliability.
NA,It should be further tested; however, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) items provide support for assessing the levels of phobia reactions among a wide range of age groups.
NA,To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet) for detection of COVID-19 features on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
NA,The Ethic Committee of our institution approved the protocol of this study and waived the requirement for patient informed consent.
NA,Two hundreds and ninety-five patients were enrolled in this study (healthy person: 149; COVID-19 patients: 146), which were divided into three separate non-overlapping cohorts (training set, n=135, healthy person, n=69, patients, n=66; validation set, n=20, healthy person, n=10, patients, n=10; test set, n=140, healthy person, n=70, patients, n=70).
NA,The DenseNet was trained and tested to classify the images as having manifestation of COVID-19 or as healthy.
NA,A radiologist also blindly evaluated all the test images and rechecked the misdiagnosed cases by DenseNet.
NA,Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess the model performance.
NA,The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DenseNet model and radiologist were also calculated.
NA,The DenseNet algorithm model yielded an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.958-1.0) in the validation set and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.972-0.995) in the test set.
NA,The threshold value was selected as 0.8, while for validation and test sets, the accuracies were 95% and 92%, the sensitivities were 100% and 97%, the specificities were 90% and 87%, and the F1 values were 95% and 93%, respectively.
NA,The sensitivity of radiologist was 94%, the specificity was 96%, while the accuracy was 95%.
NA,Deep learning (DL) with DenseNet can accurately classify COVID-19 on HRCT with an AUC of 0.98, which can reduce the miss diagnosis rate (combined with radiologists' evaluation) and radiologists' workload.
NA,It has been over 2 months since the start of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
NA,The epidemic stage of COVID-19 has brought great challenges to the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
NA,Symptoms, such as fever and cough caused by cancer, and the therapeutic process (including chemotherapy and surgery) should be differentiated from some COVID-19 related characteristics.
NA,Besides, clinical workers should not only consider the therapeutic strategy for cancer, but also emphasize COVID-19's prevention.
NA,Moreover, the detailed therapeutic regimens of CRC patients may be different from the usual.
NA,Also, treatment principles may various for CRC patients with or without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as patients with or without an emergency presentation.
NA,In this paper, we want to discuss the above-mentioned problems based on previous guidelines, the current working status and our experiences, to provide a reference for medical personnel.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic continues, with the number of infections and deaths increasing.
NA,The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative.
NA,Until now, there has been no reports concerning the nervous system onset.
NA,We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.
NA,Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone.
NA,There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion.
NA,The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed.
NA,At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment.
NA,After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.
NA,We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic affecting healthcare centers across the globe.
NA,Patients with cancer have been reported to be particularly vulnerable to infection, morbidity, and severe events.
NA,Given the high proportion of asymptomatic carriers and concerns regarding speed and availability of laboratory testing, novel detection strategies are necessary to supplement traditional screening methods and facilitate mitigation of viral transmission.
NA,Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
NA,This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.
NA,We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection has to be confirmed by virological diagnosis.
NA,Multiple diagnostic tests are available without enough perspective on their reliability.
NA,Therefore, it is important to choose the most suitable test according to its sensitivity and specificity but also to the stage of the disease.
NA,Currently, the RT-PCR detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples is the most reliable test to confirm the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,It has to be done in Class II biological safety laboratory.
NA,However, it may lack sensitivity, particularly in the advanced phase of infection, and depends closely on the samples' quality.
NA,Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests.
NA,Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management.
NA,The detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is better used for epidemiological analyses.
NA,Research should be encouraged to overcome the limits of the currently available diagnostic tests.
NA,Operating room (OR) practice during the COVID-19 pandemic is driven by basic principles, shared experience, and nascent literature.
NA,This study aimed to identify the knowledge needs of the global OR workforce, and characterise supportive evidence to establish consensus.
NA,A rapid, modified Delphi exercise was performed, open to all stakeholders, informed via an online international collaborative evaluation.
NA,The consensus exercise was completed by 339 individuals from 41 countries (64% UK).
NA,Consensus was reached on 71/100 statements, predominantly standardisation of OR pathways, OR staffing, and pre-operative screening or diagnosis.
NA,The highest levels of consensus were observed in statements relating to appropriate personal and protective equipment (PPE) and risk distribution (96-99%), clear consent processes (96%), multidisciplinary decision-making and working (97%).
NA,Statements yielding equivocal responses predominantly related to technical and procedure choices, including: decontamination (40-68%), laminar flow systems (13-61%), PPE reuse (58%), risk stratification of patients (21-48%), open vs. laparoscopic surgery (63%), preferential cholecystostomy in biliary disease (48%), and definition of aerosol generating procedures (19%).
NA,High levels of consensus existed for many statements within each domain, supporting much of the initial guidance issued by professional bodies, yet several contentious areas arose, which represent urgent targets for investigation to delineate safe COVID-19 related OR practice.

NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic.
NA,Therefore, convenient, timely and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed.
NA,Here, we review the types, characteristics and shortcomings of various detection methods, as well as perspectives for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
NA,Clinically, nucleic acid-based methods are sensitive but prone to false-positive.
NA,The antibody-based method has slightly lower sensitivity but higher accuracy.
NA,Therefore, it is suggested to combine the two methods to improve the detection accuracy of COVID-19.
NA,COVID-19 is associated with a high prevalence of activation of the coagulation cascade.
NA,It has been suggested that this so-called COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is predictive of a poor outcome and of mortality.
NA,Consensus documents on how to manage patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are based on the limited number of mainly retrospective studies that is currently available, and for this reason the recommendations are not always consistent with one another.
NA,In this article, we review the first studies into COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and give the most important do's and don'ts for diagnostics and the daily management of coagulopathy and the prevention of complications in patients with, or with strongly-suspected, COVID-19 in Dutch clinical practice.
NA,Clinical characteristics and outcomes among older patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection differ greatly from those seen in younger patients.
NA,Here we highlight atypical presentations of this fulminant infectious disease COVID-19, based on a clinical case and a cohort of 19 patients admitted to a geriatric ward.
NA,The degree of frailty, resilience and number of co-morbidities caused COVID-19 to present as acute geriatric syndrome events such as falls, delirium and dehydration in these patients.
NA,Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population.
NA,As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Protocols for diagnosis, and contact isolation measures, should take these atypical presentations into account.
NA,Under the global pandemic of COVID-19, the use of artificial intelligence to analyze chest X-ray (CXR) image for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage is becoming important.
NA,Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic collection of CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult.
NA,To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs.
NA,Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic with serious clinical manifestations including death.
NA,A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way.
NA,While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention.
NA,The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.
NA,Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak poses continued struggles due to the unprecedented number of patients admitted to intensive care units and the overwhelming need for mechanical ventilation.
NA,We report a preliminary case series of 32 patients with COVID-19 who underwent elective tracheostomies after a mean intubation period of 15 days (range, 9-21 days).
NA,The procedure was performed with percutaneous (10 cases) and open (22 cases) surgical techniques.
NA,Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed.
NA,Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed.
NA,The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.
NA,This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent associated with coronavirus disease, which emerged in late 2019.
NA,In response, we developed a diagnostic panel consisting of 3 real-time reverse transcription PCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid gene and evaluated use of these assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,All assays demonstrated a linear dynamic range of 8 orders of magnitude and an analytical limit of detection of 5 copies/reaction of quantified RNA transcripts and 1 x 10<sup>-1.5</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL of cell-cultured SARS-CoV-2.
NA,All assays performed comparably with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretions, serum, and fecal specimens spiked with cultured virus.
NA,We obtained no false-positive amplifications with other human coronaviruses or common respiratory pathogens.
NA,Results from all 3 assays were highly correlated during clinical specimen testing.
NA,On February 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of this panel.
NA,Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is a major cause of death and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries, however, the etiologic agents are often undetermined due to the lack of molecular diagnostics in hospitals and clinics.
NA,To examine evidence for select viral infections among patients with SARI in northern Vietnam, we studied 348 nasopharyngeal samples from military and civilian patients admitted to 4 hospitals in the greater Hanoi area from 2017-2019.
NA,Initial screening for human respiratory viral pathogens was performed in Hanoi, Vietnam at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) or the Military Institute of Preventative Medicine (MIPM), and an aliquot was shipped to Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore for validation.
NA,Patient demographics were recorded and used to epidemiologically describe the infections.
NA,Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses.
NA,Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%).
NA,Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7-22.9).
NA,As influenza A and B viruses were commonly associated with SARI and are treatable, SARI patients entering these hospitals would benefit if the hospitals were able to adapt onsite molecular diagnostics.
NA,The pandemic caused by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infecting millions of populations worldwide and counting, has demanded quick and potential therapeutic strategies.
NA,Current approved drugs or molecules under clinical trials can be a good pool for repurposing through <i>in-silico</i> techniques to quickly identify promising drug candidates.
NA,The structural information of recently released crystal structures of main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) in APO and complex with inhibitors, N3, and 13b molecules was utilized to explore the binding site architecture through Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
NA,The stable state of M<sup>pro</sup> was used to conduct extensive virtual screening of the aforementioned drug pool.
NA,Considering the recent success of HIV protease molecules, we also used anti-protease molecules for drug repurposing purposes.
NA,The identified top hits were further evaluated through MD simulations followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA.
NA,Interestingly, in our screening, several promising drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup>.
NA,However, based on control (N3 and 13b), we have identified six potential molecules, Leupeptin Hemisulphate, Pepstatin A, Nelfinavir, Birinapant, Lypression and Octreotide which have shown the reasonably significant MM-GBSA score.
NA,Further insight shows that the molecules form stable interactions with <i>hot-spot</i> residues, that are mainly conserved and can be targeted for structure- and pharmacophore-based designing.
NA,The pharmacokinetic annotations and therapeutic importance have suggested that these molecules possess drug-like properties and pave their way for <i>in-vitro</i> studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 pandemic.
NA,Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a frequent cardiovascular and/or respiratory complication among hospitalized patients, is one of the known sequelae of the illness.
NA,Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are often elderly, immobile, and show signs of coagulopathy.
NA,Therefore, it is reasonable to assume a high incidence of VTE among these patients.
NA,Presently, the incidence of VTE is estimated at around 25% of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for COVID-19 even under anticoagulant treatment at prophylactic doses.
NA,In this review, we discuss present knowledge of the topic, the unique challenges of diagnosis and treatment of VTE, as well as some of the potential mechanisms of increased risk for VTE during the illness.
NA,Understanding the true impact of VTE on patients with COVID-19 will potentially improve our ability to reach a timely diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, mitigating the risk for this susceptible population during a complicated disease.
NA,Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death.
NA,The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care.
NA,With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities.
NA,Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance.
NA,During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer.
NA,Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status.
NA,As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made.
NA,Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).
NA,Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested.
NA,Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 <sup>0/7</sup> weeks of gestation.
NA,With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 <sup>0/7</sup> weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features.
NA,KEY POINTS: · Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants fewer office visits..
NA,· Women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy..
NA,· Earlier delivery suggested with COVID-19 and hypertensive disorder..
NA,On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.
NA,Recently, Hermans, et.al., outlined the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic pose for the bleeding disorders community <sup>1</sup> .
NA,The general response to the pandemic has included increased measures focused on personal hygiene, social distancing, symptom monitoring, early diagnosis, patient isolation, shelter in place, and public health quarantine.
NA,Accordingly, such measures have led to concerns over how to maintain access to haemophilia treatment products and to the specialized integrated care medical follow up within the haemophilia treatment centers (HTCs).
NA,As part of the medical response to disasters such as a world-wide pandemic, telemedicine has emerged as one proposed solution to address this type of global challenge <sup>2</sup> .
NA,Governments and clinicians that were fully involved in the dramatic SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during the last few weeks in Italy (and more or less all over the world) are fiercely debating the use of methods for screening this viral infection.
NA,Thus, all countries are employing a lot of resources in order to test more and more subjects.
NA,For this purpose, there are different strategies, based on either direct or indirect tests.
NA,Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed.
NA,In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed.
NA,If we want to identify &quot;immune&quot; people in order to let them to come back to work, serology is the best (and probably the only) approach.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to assess the role of Tocilizumab therapy (TCZ) in terms of ICU admission and mortality rate of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. <b>Design:</b> Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE).
NA,A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. <b>Setting:</b> The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. <b>Participants:</b> Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. <b>Interventions:</b> TCZ was administered to 21 patients.
NA,The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. <b>Main Outcomes and Measures:</b> ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate.
NA,Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. <b>Results:</b> There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years).
NA,Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin).
NA,No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration.
NA,This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC.
NA,Analysis of laboratory measures showed significant interactions between time and treatment regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets and international normalized ratio (INR) levels.
NA,Variation in lymphocytes count was observed over time, irrespective of treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients.
NA,Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global ongoing pandemic.
NA,Timely, accurate and non-invasive SARS-CoV-2 detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, as well as determination of their immune status, will facilitate effective large-scale pandemic control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
NA,Saliva is a biofluid whose anatomical source and location is of particularly strategic relevance to COVID-19 transmission and monitoring.
NA,This review focuses on the role of saliva as both a foe (a common mode of viral transmission via salivary droplets and potentially aerosols) and a friend (as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for viral detection and immune status surveillance) in combating COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that impacts the lower respiratory tract.
NA,The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
NA,To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
NA,Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
NA,Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.
NA,Coronavirus is still the leading cause of death worldwide.
NA,There are a set number of COVID-19 test units accessible in emergency clinics because of the expanding cases daily.
NA,Therefore, it is important to implement an automatic detection and classification system as a speedy elective finding choice to forestall COVID-19 spreading among individuals.
NA,Medical images analysis is one of the most promising research areas, it provides facilities for diagnosis and making decisions of a number of diseases such as Coronavirus.
NA,This paper conducts a comparative study of the use of the recent deep learning models (VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet201, Inception_ResNet_V2, Inception_V3, Resnet50, and MobileNet_V2) to deal with detection and classification of coronavirus pneumonia.
NA,The experiments were conducted using chest X-ray &amp; CT dataset of 6087 images (2780 images of bacterial pneumonia, 1493 of coronavirus, 231 of Covid19, and 1583 normal) and confusion matrices are used to evaluate model performances.
NA,Results found out that the use of inception_Resnet_V2 and Densnet201 provide better results compared to other models used in this work (92.18% accuracy for Inception-ResNetV2 and 88.09% accuracy for Densnet201).

NA,<b>Aim:</b> There is a critical need for effective therapies that are immediately available to control the spread of COVID-19 disease. <b>Material &amp; methods:</b> Gamunex<sup>®</sup>-C and Flebogamma<sup>®</sup> DIF (Grifols) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products were tested using ELISA techniques for antibodies against several antigens of human common betacoronaviruses that may crossreact with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. <b>Results:</b> Both IVIGs showed consistent reactivity to components of the tested viruses.
NA,Positive crossreactivity was seen in SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
NA,For SARS-CoV-2, positive reactivity was observed at IVIG concentrations ranging from 100 μg/ml with Gamunex-C to 1 mg/ml with Flebogamma 5% DIF. <b>Conclusion:</b> Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF contain antibodies reacting against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
NA,Studies to confirm the utility of IVIG preparations for COVID-19 management may be warranted.
NA,Researchers have reported some useful information about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients in addition, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19.
NA,The surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as ACE2, which mediates the binding and entry of CoV.
NA,After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation.However, having all the information about the prevalence of the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19.
NA,A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 proteins on tissue surface.
NA,In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system has been discussed.
NA,It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19.
NA,In conclusion, this review may provide useful information to develop some strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common severe complications.
NA,There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19 in chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans; however, their availability to clinical staff in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised.
NA,At this moment, the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) has yet to be explored.
NA,The purpose of this case report is to describe the natural course of the disease in mild infection managed at home.
NA,We report a 35-year-old man with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection.
NA,Clinical examination was unremarkable.
NA,The diagnosis of mild disease was made clinically which was later reaffirmed by LUS after identifying a bilateral small pleural effusion and a thickened pleural line.
NA,During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever).
NA,The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home.
NA,LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray.
NA,We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.
NA,As the COVID-19 outbreak spreads, there is a growing need for a compilation of conserved RNA genome regions in the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with their structural propensities to guide development of antivirals and diagnostics.
NA,Here we present a first look at RNA sequence conservation and structural propensities in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
NA,Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nucleotides as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences subsequently reported from the COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30 'SARS-related-conserved' regions.
NA,We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome.
NA,We provide 106 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured' regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA.
NA,We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the extended 5' UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3' UTR.
NA,Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome that have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains.
NA,These 59 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured' genomic regions may be most easily targeted in primer-based diagnostic and oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies.
NA,The pandemic due to a novel coronavirus has been sweeping across different regions of the globe since January 2020.
NA,Early reports of this infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consisted of mostly adult patients.
NA,As the outbreak spreads rapidly beyond the epicentre of Wuhan, it becomes clear that infants and children of all ages are susceptible to this infection.
NA,In China, there have been more than 1200 paediatric cases.
NA,Most paediatric patients acquire the infection through household contact with infected adults.
NA,The disease in children is usually self-limiting and most infected children will recover uneventfully within 7-10 days.
NA,Other than symptoms of the respiratory tract, many children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,Older children are more likely to have asymptomatic infection.
NA,Although deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 are rarely reported in the paediatric age group, young children and those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe illness.
NA,Only a small fraction of neonates born to infected mother would acquire the virus by vertical transmission.
NA,Because a large proportion of children and adolescents may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection, children are likely to play an important role in community transmission of this infection.
NA,Screening of children who have a definitive contact history will facilitate early diagnosis and isolation of all infected children.
NA,This review summarises the lessons learned in China with regard to the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population.
NA,The world is experiencing the evolving situation associated with the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) virus, and there is more of need than ever for stress management and self-care.
NA,In this article, we will define the physiological, psychological and social aspects, stages, and components of stress reactions in the context of COVID-19, review the relevant literature on stress reactions, and offer some guidance on how to help patients mitigate the physiological and psychological impact of the pandemic through resilience-building techniques.
NA,There is continued evidence that the fight or flight response involves activation throughout the body at physiological, biochemical and immune levels.
NA,This response can be mitigated through increasing parasympathetic nervous system activation as well as cognitive and behavioral interventions.
NA,This article will review the stress, provide a theoretical layout to predict upcoming response, and offer clinicians some practical interventions to employ as the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic continues.
NA,In the fight against COVID 19, the government of India announced a 3 weeks lockdown of the entire country of 1.3 billion people on 24<sup>th</sup> March 2020.
NA,One week after the lockdown was announced, we conducted an anonymous online survey of the orthopaedic surgeons in India through social media platforms to assess the impact of the lockdown during COVID 19.
NA,The survey had a total of 13 questions with (3-5) options and was designed with an aim to understand the perception and the state of mind of the Orthopaedic surgeons in the lockdown situation.
NA,The survey was completed by 611 orthopaedic surgeons from 140 cities in India.
NA,There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out.
NA,As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling &quot;definitely stressed out&quot; increased.
NA,Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the &quot;definitely stressed out&quot; group.
NA,The psychological impact of the lockdown during COVID 19 on orthopaedic surgeons may become a potential concern that will require addressal through open discussion. diagnostic level 4.

NA,COVID-19 has had its heaviest toll on Europe, United States and China.
NA,As of 1 <sup>st</sup> of April 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa was relatively low, with the highest number registered by South Africa, which had reported 1,380 confirmed cases.
NA,On the same date (also the date of this review), Africa had reported 5,999 confirmed cases, of which 3,838 (almost 65%) occurred in South Africa, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, with the remaining 2,071 cases distributed unevenly across the other African countries.
NA,We speculate that while African nations are currently experiencing much lower rates of COVID-19 relative to other continents, their significantly lower testing rates may grossly underestimate incidence rates.
NA,Failure to grasp the true picture may mean crucial windows of opportunity shut unutilized, while limited resources are not deployed to maximum effect.
NA,In the absence of extensive testing data, an overestimation of spread may lead to disproportionate measures being taken, causing avoidable strain on livelihoods and economies.
NA,Here, based on the African situation, we discuss COVID-19 diagnostic challenges and how they may blunt responses.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) which resulted in a cluster of cases of pneumonia that originated in China around 31 December 2019 and has subsequently spread across the globe.
NA,Currently, COVID-19 represents a health emergency worldwide, leading, in severe cases, to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction or failure, and death.
NA,In the context of limited scientific knowledge and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, guidance is becoming increasingly necessary for pathologists who have to perform postmortem investigations on COVID-19 cases.
NA,The aim of the present report is to share a procedure applicable to cases of COVID-19-related death, particularly in cases of death without medical intervention and in the absence of an ascertained SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 diagnosis, therefore providing support for diagnostic activity in the present COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,For this purpose, a standard operating procedure for correct swab collection, autopsy investigation and tissue sampling is provided.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented in modern history.
NA,Its effects on social behavior and health care delivery have been dramatic.
NA,The resultant burden of disease and critical illness has outpaced the diagnostic, therapeutic, and health care professional resources of many clinics and hospitals.
NA,It continues to do so globally.
NA,The allocation of hospital beds and ventilators, personal protective equipment, investigational therapeutics, and other scarce resources has required difficult decisions.
NA,Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,How can we best adapt as physicians and surgeons?
NA,What foundational ethical principles and systems of principle application can help guide our decision-making?
NA,Fortunately, a large body of work in medical ethics addresses these questions.
NA,Unfortunately, many surgeons and other health care professionals are probably not as familiar with these concepts.
NA,This brief communication is intended to provide a concise explanation of ethical considerations which readers may find helpful when addressing allocation of scarce resources and alterations in surgical care brought on by the current pandemic.
NA,To date, no study attempted to quantify the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on incidence and treatment of acute stroke.
NA,Retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator.
NA,A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the center with the largest case volume.
NA,Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments (40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)).
NA,No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%).
NA,The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), p=0.034.
NA,There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.
NA,These results suggest overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.
NA,Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.
NA,To report our initial experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing standard of care invasive management.
NA,The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients.
NA,Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care.
NA,We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS.
NA,All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated.
NA,Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively.
NA,PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes.
NA,Two patients conservatively treated died.
NA,The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6.
NA,ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support.
NA,Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients.
NA,Complete patient history and examination, routine ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and careful evaluation of changes in cardiac enzymes should be part of the regular assessment procedures also in dedicated COVID positive units.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most serious global challenges to delivering affordable and equitable treatment to children with cancer we have witnessed in the last few decades.
NA,This Special Report aims to summarize general principles for continuing multidisciplinary care during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,With contributions from the leadership of the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), Children's Oncology Group (COG), St Jude Global program, and Childhood Cancer International, we have sought to provide a framework for healthcare teams caring for children with cancer during the pandemic.
NA,We anticipate the burden will fall particularly heavily on children, their families, and cancer services in low- and middle-income countries.
NA,Therefore, we have brought together the relevant clinical leads from SIOP Europe, COG, and SIOP-PODC (Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) to focus on the six most curable cancers that are part of the WHO Global Initiative in Childhood Cancer.
NA,We provide some practical advice for adapting diagnostic and treatment protocols for children with cancer during the pandemic, the measures taken to contain it (e.g., extreme social distancing), and how to prepare for the anticipated recovery period.
NA,Emerging infectious diseases, the persistent potential for destabilising pandemics, remain a global threat leading to excessive morbidity and mortality.
NA,The current outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) illustrated difficulties in lack of effective drugs for treatment.
NA,Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for early recognition and treatment of infectious diseases, allowing timely implementation of infection control, improved clinical care and other public health measures to stop the spread of the disease.
NA,CRISPR-Cas technology speed up the development of infectious disease diagnostics with high rapid and accurate.
NA,In this review, we summarise current advance regarding diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, in the development of fast, accurate and portable diagnostic tests and highlight the potential of CRISPR-Cas13 in COVID-19 Pneumonia and other emerging infectious diseases diagnosis.
NA,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in the modern age both due to its scale and its disruption to daily life throughout the world.
NA,Widespread social isolation and restrictions in the age of modern communicative technology, coupled with some early successes for makers, have united the open-source community towards a common goal in a way not previously seen.
NA,Local hospitals and care facilities are turning to makers to print essential consumable parts, such as simple visors, while in the hardest hit areas, critical pieces of medical technology are being fabricated.
NA,While important and effective innovations are appearing almost daily, there are also some worrying trends towards hobbyists attempting manufacture of complex medical devices with little understanding of the clinical or scientific rationale behind their design.
NA,The nature of the open-source community, an area of intensive innovation, fluidity, and experimentation, jars with the exacting standards of medical device regulation.
NA,Here, we review the involvement of rapid prototyping and the open-source community in the key areas of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostics, critical care technology, and information acquisition and sharing, highlighting where makers and hackers have clashed with medical device regulations, and areas where the system has worked well to facilitate change.
NA,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the post-operative period is challenging.
NA,Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications.
NA,Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19.
NA,We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. <b> <i>Patients and Methods:</i> </b> We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,Among them, five (62%) required mechanical ventilation and two (25%) died.
NA,All had abnormal chest CT with typical findings of COVID-19 in 87%.
NA,Computed tomography provided an alternate diagnosis in 53% of patients who did not have COVID-19.
NA,The average time between a COVID-19-positive chest CT and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation was 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days). <b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
NA,Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.
NA,The expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world has alarmed all health professionals.
NA,Especially in dentistry, there is a growing concern due to it's high virulence and routes of transmission through saliva aerosols.
NA,The virus keeps viable on air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours.
NA,In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities).
NA,This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals.
NA,Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment.
NA,The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents.
NA,Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
NA,Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
NA,All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
NA,The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
NA,Recipients of heart transplant (HT) may be at increased risk of adverse outcomes attributable to infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of multiple comorbidities and clinically significant immunosuppression.
NA,To describe the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of recipients of HT with COVID-19.
NA,This case series from a single large academic heart transplant program in New York, New York, incorporates data from between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020.
NA,All recipients of HT followed up by this center who were infected with COVID-19 were included.
NA,Heart transplant and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up.
NA,Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19.
NA,Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years.
NA,Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%).
NA,Twenty-two participants (79%) were admitted for treatment, and 7 (25%) required mechanical ventilation.
NA,Most (13 of 17 [76%]) had evidence of myocardial injury (median high-sensitivity troponin T, 0.055 [IQR, 0.0205-0.1345] ng/mL) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 11.83 [IQR, 7.44-19.26] mg/dL; median peak interleukin 6, 105 [IQR, 38-296] pg/mL).
NA,Among patients managed at the study institution, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in 16 patients (70%), and 6 (26%) had a reduction in the dose of their calcineurin inhibitor.
NA,Treatment of COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (18 patients [78%]), high-dose corticosteroids (8 patients [47%]), and interleukin 6 receptor antagonists (6 patients [26%]).
NA,Overall, 7 patients (25%) died.
NA,Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization.
NA,In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT.
NA,Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients.
NA,Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.
NA,The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a rapid proliferation of serologic assays.
NA,However, little is known about their clinical performance.
NA,Here, we compared two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. 103 specimens from 48 patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 153 control specimens were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays by Abbott and EUROIMMUN (EI).
NA,Duration from symptom onset was determined by medical record review.
NA,Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and concordance were calculated.
NA,The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had a diagnostic specificity of 99.4% (95% CI; 96.41-99.98%), and sensitivity of 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at &lt;3 days post symptom onset, 30.0% (95% CI; 11.89-54.28) at 3-7d, 47.8% (95% CI; 26.82-69.41) at 8-13d and 93.8% (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at ≥14d.
NA,Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative.
NA,The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at &lt;3d, 25.0% (95% CI; 8.66-49.10) at 3-7d, 56.5% (95% CI; 34.49-76.81) at 3-7d and 85.4% (95% CI; 72.24-93.93) at ≥14d if borderline results were considered positive.
NA,The qualitative concordance between the assays was 0.83 (95% CI; 0.75-0.91).
NA,The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the EI assay.
NA,However, diagnostic sensitivity was poor in both assays during the first 14 days of symptoms.
NA,To evaluate the reliability of self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses because swab collections for SARS-CoV-2 put health workers at risk of infection and require use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,In a prospective study, patients from two states in Australia attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs (SCNT) prior to health worker collect (HC) using throat and nasal swabs (Site 1) or throat and nasopharyngeal swabs (Site 2).
NA,Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses.
NA,Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa (κ) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load.
NA,Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC).
NA,SC was highly concordant with HC (κ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (κ = 0.959 vs 0.933).
NA,Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT.
NA,Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.
NA,During the past two decades, three novel coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged to cause international human epidemics with severe morbidity.
NA,CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals.
NA,A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats.
NA,To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.
NA,We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs.
NA,We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses.
NA,Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with 11 common respiratory viruses was observed.
NA,The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4 × 10<sup>2</sup> copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested.
NA,To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market.
NA,The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
NA,Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types.
NA,This assay can be used for detection and identification of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.
NA,A 46-year old construction worker presented at the emergency department with two orthostatic syncopes.
NA,The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner.
NA,Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension.
NA,Other vital signs without pathological findings.
NA,Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin.
NA,Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates.
NA,After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19.
NA,Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected.
NA,A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
NA,After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
NA,The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
NA,The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending.
NA,Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated.
NA,While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days.
NA,Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis.
NA,The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation.
NA,This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings.
NA,Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts.
NA,Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis.
NA,Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.
NA,Ein 46-jähriger Bauarbeiter stellte sich bei seit ca.
NA,7 Tagen bestehender Infektsymptomatik mit Fieber und teilweise produktivem Husten sowie 2-maliger orthotstatischer Synkope in der Notaufnahme vor.
NA,Ambulant war bereits eine orale antibiotische Therapie über 5 Tage mit Sultamicillin durch den Hausarzt eingeleitet worden, die zu keiner Beschwerdebesserung führte.
NA,In der klinischen Untersuchung zeigten sich hypertone Blutdruckwerte bei bekannter arterieller Hypertonie, ansonsten unauffällige Vitalparameter sowie pulmonal feinblasige Rasselgeräusche links basal.
NA,Laborchemisch präsentierten sich erhöhte Werte für LDH sowie pro-BNP und CRP bei normwertigen Leukozyten und normwertigem Procalcitonin.
NA,Bei Verdacht auf Pneumonie wurde zunächst ein konventionelles Röntgenbild der Lunge durchgeführt, das laterale Verschattungen in beiden Lungen zeigte, verdächtig auf eine atypische Pneumonie.
NA,Bei initial negativem Rachenabstrich trotz typischer klinischer, radiologischer und laborchemischer Konstellation erfolgte ein erneuter tiefer Rachenabstrich auf SARS-CoV-2, welcher ebenfalls negativ ausfiel.
NA,In der nachgeschalteten CT-Untersuchung des Thorax zeigten sich für COVID-19 typische bipulmonale laterale milchglasartige Infiltrate, woraufhin ein dritter Rachenabstrich durchgeführt wurde, der erneut negativ blieb.
NA,Nach Asservierung und PCR-Analyse von Sputum konnte schließlich der Nachweis von SARS-CoV-2 erbracht und die Diagnose einer COVID-19-assoziierten Pneumonie gesichert werden.
NA,Es erfolgte die stationäre Aufnahme zur Infekt- und Synkopen-Abklärung.
NA,Bei zunächst noch ausstehendem Ergebnis des Rachenabstrichs auf SARS-CoV-2 wurde der Patient prophylaktisch isoliert.
NA,Bei Verdacht auf eine mögliche bakteriell-superinfizierte Pneumonie wurde eine intravenöse antibiotische Therapie mit Ampicillin/Sulbactam eingeleitet, welche nach 3 Tagen bei fehlenden Hinweisen auf bakterielle Erreger beendet wurde.
NA,Nach Diagnosesicherung erfolgte bei bereits eingetretener klinischer Rekonvaleszenz keine antivirale Therapie.
NA,Der Patient wurde 17 Tage nach initialem Symptombeginn ohne weitere Quarantäne-Auflagen nach Hause entlassen.
NA,Die Kasuistik beschreibt einen Fall von COVID-19, bei dem trotz typischer klinischer Symptomatik sowie typischen radiologischen und laborchemischen Befunden ein Virusnachweis in mehrfach korrekt durchgeführten tiefen Rachenabstrichen nicht möglich war.
NA,Erst eine Sputum-Analyse erbrachte den Nachweis der viralen RNA und sicherte die Diagnose.
NA,Bei begründetem klinischem Verdacht auf COVID-19 sollte daher bei negativen Rachenabstrichen zum sicheren Ausschluss eine Analyse von tiefen Atemwegssekreten (Sputum, bronchoalveoläre Lavage, Trachealsekret) oder Stuhl erfolgen.
NA,A Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team is trained to deal with troubling situations.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic confronted health care systems with different challenges.
NA,In Europe, the first COVID-19 patients presented in late February 2020.
NA,Our region was among the most severely affected in central Europe.
NA,Therefore, front-line operations, such as emergency departments (ED), were highly stressed by immediate demand for diagnostic swab-testing, and additional personnel were urgently needed within a short time.
NA,In the meantime, clinical activities of medical students (MS) were on hold, and teaching had to be restructured to online formats.
NA,However, we expected that MS would benefit tremendously from learning opportunities through active involvement in this pandemic.
NA,The coronavirus pandemic has led to significant challenges for healthcare delivery across the globe.
NA,Non-emergency endoscopic activity in the UK has been postponed, raising concerns of increased delays in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and a surge in demand once services resume.
NA,Measures to mitigate this risk must be considered.
NA,This paper reviews various investigative modalities for colorectal disease which could be deployed during cessation of colonoscopy services.
NA,We focus on colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) due to its relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ability to triage patients effectively to further endoscopic investigations.
NA,CT of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested as a triage tool while access to colonoscopy is limited.
NA,However, CT may lead to the spread of COVID-19 as patients attend the hospital, and it exposes them to the risks of radiation.
NA,Faecal immunochemistry tests have been demonstrated as a good predictor of colonic pathology and could be safely used to risk stratify patients when prioritising colonoscopy.
NA,CCE is a safe and innovative technology for investigating the colon.
NA,Procedures can be carried out in the community and can be conducted safely during the coronavirus pandemic.
NA,It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy.
NA,As colonoscopy services resume, they will likely experience high demand leading to further delays for patients.
NA,CCE could be used to reduce the number of patients requiring colonoscopy and triage those requiring further endoscopic investigations appropriately.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unprecedented in our professional lives and much effort and resources will be devoted to care of patients (and HCW) affected by this illness.
NA,We must also continue to aim for the same standard of care for our non-COVID respiratory patients, while minimizing risks of infection transmission to our colleagues.
NA,This commentary addresses the key paired issues of minimizing performance of diagnostic/staging bronchoscopy in patients with suspected/known lung cancer while maximizing the safety of the procedure with respect to HCW transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Coronaviruses cause severe human viral diseases including SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
NA,Most recently SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19) has led to a pandemic with no successful therapeutics.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on trimeric spike (S) proteins to facilitate virus entry into host cells by binding to ACE2 receptor on host cell membranes.
NA,Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are promising agents against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Here we describe using humanized llama antibody VHHs against SARS-CoV-2 that would overcome the limitations associated with polyclonal and monoclonal combination therapies.
NA,From two llama VHH libraries, unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were identified.
NA,Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking.
NA,Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an <i>in-silico</i> approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains.
NA,Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.
NA,Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Thus, we aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic antibodies as well as diagnostics.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide.
NA,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
NA,The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers.
NA,The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions.
NA,This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe.
NA,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
NA,Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
NA,In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
NA,Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
NA,Countries globally are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly two million cases and 120 000 deaths occurring within 4 months of the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in December 2019 in China.
NA,Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus.
NA,By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays.
NA,By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays.
NA,Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses.
NA,Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response.
NA,However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive.
NA,Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals.
NA,This review aimed to summarise the current available information for diagnoses of cases and to aid laboratories and healthcare workers to select the best assays and procedures.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted worldwide supplies of viral transport media (VTM) due to widespread demand for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.
NA,In response to this ongoing shortage, we began production of VTM in-house in support of diagnostic testing in our hospital network.
NA,As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of our medical center.
NA,We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers.
NA,Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures.
NA,Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform.
NA,VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature.
NA,We further discuss how we met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting including use of staged, assembly line for VTM transport tube production.
NA,A surge of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to New York City hospitals in March 2020 led to a sharp increase blood culture utilization, which overwhelmed the capacity of automated blood culture instruments.
NA,We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia, and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization.
NA,We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19.
NA,Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half of the month.
NA,The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than COVID-19 negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%), p &lt; 0.001.
NA,COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, reducing the bacteremia rate to 1.6% when excluded.
NA,More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation.
NA,Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial co-infection.
NA,Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during patient surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days, if necessary, to free additional capacity.
NA,We report the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) comorbid with leukemia in a patient hospitalized in Beijing, China.
NA,The patient showed a prolonged manifestation of symptoms and a protracted diagnosis period of COVID-19.
NA,It is necessary to extend isolation time, increase the number of nucleic acid detections and conduct early symptomatic treatment for children with both COVID-19 and additional health problems.
NA,To describe the characteristics of clinical manifestations of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Chongqing.
NA,All 25 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RNA-PCR) were admitted from the 4 designated treatment hospitals of 2019-nCoV in Chongqing from January 19 to March 12, 2020.
NA,Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
NA,The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing.
NA,Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females.
NA,The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years).
NA,All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province.
NA,These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases.
NA,No severe or critical cases were identified.
NA,The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%).
NA,The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days.
NA,In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well.
NA,All Lymphocyte counts were normal.
NA,There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases.
NA,There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung.
NA,All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir.
NA,The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days.
NA,There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment.
NA,All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.
NA,The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.
NA,RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.
NA,Chest x-ray (CXR) can play a role in diagnosing patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but only few small-scale studies are available.
NA,We assessed the diagnostic performance of CXR in consecutive patients presenting at the emergency room at the Policlinico San Donato, Milan, Italy from February 24 to April 8, 2020 for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The results of CXR were classified as positive or negative according to the original prospective radiologic reports.
NA,To overcome the limitations of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab, especially oscillating sensitivity, we added the information obtained from phone calls to discharged patients with negative initial RT-PCR.
NA,Thus, we included 535 patients with concomitant CXR and RT-PCR on admission (aged 65±17 y; 340 males, 195 females), resulting in 408 RT-PCR positive and 127 negative patients at the composite reference standard.
NA,Original CXR reports showed an 89.0% sensitivity (95% confidence intervals [CI], 85.5%-91.8%), 60.6% specificity (95% CI, 51.6%-69.2%), 87.9% positive predictive value (95% CI, 84.4%-90.9%), and 63.1% negative predictive value (95% CI, 53.9%-71.7%).
NA,The adoption of CXR alongside RT-PCR to triage patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a safe and efficient workflow, counteracting possible false negative RT-PCR results.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious public health concern, with an exponentially growing number of patients worldwide.
NA,Computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as a highly sensitive modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in the early stages of COVID-19.
NA,The typical features of COVID-19 in chest CT include bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidations.
NA,Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality.
NA,The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement.
NA,The extensive pulmonary involvement in some of these pathologies may obscure the typical manifestation of COVID-19, whereas other preexisting pathologies may resemble the atypical or rare CT manifestations of this viral pneumonia.
NA,Thus, understanding the specific CT manifestations in these special subgroups is essential for a prompt diagnosis.
NA,Cohort study of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).
NA,To describe the clinical and analytical features of a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infected cohort with SCI to enable accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures.
NA,This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain).
NA,A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was performed.
NA,Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples.
NA,Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered.
NA,RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven).
NA,The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-10).
NA,Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven).
NA,The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom).
NA,The Modified Early Warning System score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in five out of seven cases.
NA,All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-rays at the time of diagnosis.
NA,All patients recovered gradually.
NA,Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population.
NA,Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity.
NA,The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected.
NA,This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
NA,Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) may increase due to upregulation in patients using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).
NA,Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19.
NA,The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain.<b>DESIGN</b>BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 32 sites in Brazil.
NA,Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
NA,Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days.
NA,The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days.
NA,Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal-pro hormone and D-dimer levels.
NA,BRACE CORONA will evaluate whether the strategy of continued ACEI/ARB therapy compared with temporary discontinuation of these drugs impacts clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19.
NA,Novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide, and tracking laboratory indexes during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 can provide a reference for patients in other countries and regions.
NA,We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days.
NA,Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after admission, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased.
NA,On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values.
NA,From 8 to 14 days of admission, the patient's condition improved, hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued.
NA,The number of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP decreased rapidly.
NA,On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased.
NA,Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis.
NA,In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease.
NA,Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.
NA,We observe changes of the main lymphocyte subsets (CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56、CD19、CD3、CD4、and CD8) in COVID-19-infected patients and explore whether the changes are associated with disease severity.
NA,One-hundred and fifty-four cases of COVID-19-infected patients were selected and divided into 3 groups (moderate group, severe group and critical group).
NA,The flow cytometry assay was performed to examine the numbers of lymphocyte subsets.
NA,CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8 + T lymphocyte subsets were decreased in COVID-19-infected patients.
NA,Compared with the moderate group and the sever group, CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the critical group decreased greatly (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.005 or P = 0.001).
NA,Reduced CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte counts may reflect the severity of the COVID-19.
NA,Monitoring T cell changes has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of severe patients who may become critically ill.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread to every inhabited continent in the world.
NA,So far, plain radiography and computed tomography have been the mainstay of imaging methods used.
NA,The present analytical paper on the role of point-of-care lung ultrasound in this pandemic examines its diagnostic accuracy, clinical utility, and physical practicality in the intensive care unit.
NA,An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) has been reported.
NA,Whether COVID-19 increases the risk of VTE in non-ICU wards remains unknown.
NA,We aimed to evaluate the burden of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer levels.
NA,In this prospective study consecutive patients hospitalized in non-intensive care units with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer &gt; 1000 ng/ml were screened for asymptomatic DVT with complete compression doppler ultrasound (CCUS).
NA,The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.
NA,The study comprised 156 patients (65.4% male).
NA,All but three patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis.
NA,Median days of hospitalization until CCUS was 9 (IQR 5-17).
NA,CCUS was positive for DVT in 23 patients (14.7%), of whom only one was proximal DVT.
NA,Seven patients (4.5%) had bilateral distal DVT.
NA,Patients with DVT had higher median D-dimer levels: 4527 (IQR 1925-9144) ng/ml vs 2050 (IQR 1428-3235) ng/ml; p &lt; 0.001.
NA,D-dimer levels &gt; 1570 ng/ml were associated with asymptomatic DVT (OR 9.1; CI 95% 1.1-70.1).
NA,D-dimer showed an acceptable discriminative capacity (area under the ROC curve 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84).
NA,In patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated D-dimer levels, the incidence of asymptomatic DVT is similar to that described in other series.
NA,Higher cut-off levels for D-dimer might be necessary for the diagnosis of DVT in COVID-19 patients.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased burden on healthcare systems with subsequent reductions in non-emergent hospitalizations and procedures.
NA,While there are widespread reports of intentional reductions in elective hospitalizations, trends in urgent or emergent hospitalizations including heart failure (HF) hospitalizations have not been adequately characterized.
NA,We evaluated trends of HF hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center using electronic health records and discharge database.
NA,We also compared HF hospitalization trends during the same time frame in 2019 to account for seasonal variation in HF presentations.
NA,Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our medical center, a mean of 30 patients per week were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF.
NA,After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Mississippi, there was a sharp 50% decline in the number of HF hospitalizations that declined even further after a &quot;state of emergency&quot; was declared in Mississippi.
NA,Based on observations from a large academic medical center, there has been a significant reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for HF during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Further investigation of these trends is warranted to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term HF outcomes.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to sweep the world, causing infection of millions and death of hundreds of thousands.
NA,The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID-19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively.
NA,These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs).
NA,Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia.
NA,This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs.
NA,It hopes to provide information for practitioners in the medical field during the epidemic season.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent and unprecedented need for rapid large-scale diagnostic testing to inform timely patient management.
NA,However, robust data are lacking on the relative performance of available rapid molecular tests across a full range of viral concentrations.
NA,This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations.
NA,A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay.
NA,Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert.
NA,Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively.
NA,Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value &lt;30).
NA,However, for Ct values &gt;30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert.
NA,While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations.
NA,Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of ID Now for direct swabs.
NA,With emergence of pandemic COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic testing is essential.
NA,This study compared laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian hospital and public health laboratories, and some commercially available real-time RT-PCR assays.
NA,Overall, analytical sensitivities were equivalent between LDTs and most commercially available methods.
NA,There are questions and challenges regarding neurologic complications in COVID-19 patients.
NA,EEG is a safe and efficient tool for the evaluation of brain function, even in the context of COVID-19.
NA,However, EEG technologists should not be put in danger if obtaining an EEG does not significantly advance diagnosis or change management in the patient.
NA,Not every neurologic problem stems from a primary brain injury: confusion, impaired consciousness that evolves to stupor and coma, and headaches are frequent in hypercapnic/hypoxic encephalopathies.
NA,In patients with chronic pulmonary disorders, acute symptomatic seizures have been reported in acute respiratory failure in 6%.
NA,The clinician should be aware of the various EEG patterns in hypercapnic/hypoxic and anoxic (post-cardiac arrest syndrome) encephalopathies as well as encephalitides.
NA,In this emerging pandemic of infectious disease, single-use subdermal EEG needle electrodes may be used in comatose patients.
NA,Full EEG montages using the 10-20 system, including a derivation for ECG, are strongly recommended so as to cover relevant temporal lobe regions.
NA,We recommend noting whether the patient is undergoing or has been placed prone, as well as noting the body and head position during the EEG recording (supine versus prone) to avoid overinterpretation of respiratory, head movement, electrode, muscle or other artifacts.
NA,There is slight elevation of intracranial pressure in the prone position.
NA,In non-comatose patients, the hyperventilation procedure should be avoided.
NA,At present, non-specific EEG findings and abnormalities should not be considered as being specific for COVID-19 related encephalopathy.
NA,As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic sweeps across the world, the availability of viral transport medium (VTM) has become severely limited, contributing to delays in diagnosis and rationing of diagnostic testing.
NA,Given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA has demonstrated stability, we posited that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) may be a viable transport medium, as an alternative to VTM, for clinical real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing.
NA,The intra-individual reliability and interindividual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR were assessed in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS to evaluate the stability of the qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours.
NA,We report that the use of PBS as a transport medium allows high intra-individual and interindividual reliability, maintains viral stability, and compares with VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage.
NA,This study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Use of PBS as a transport medium has the potential to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, aiding more widespread screening and early diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,To determine whether the course of COVID-19 is more severe in patients with MS and if MS disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) affect the risk of contracting the disease.
NA,In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system.
NA,Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis.
NA,We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography.
NA,We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models.
NA,Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
NA,Only two patients required hospitalization.
NA,No patient required intensive care.
NA,In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values&lt;0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
NA,Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
NA,(RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005).
NA,The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.
NA,B-cell depleting antibodies may increase the susceptibility to contracting COVID-19.
NA,The leading risk factor for <i>Clostridioides</i> (<i>Clostridium</i>) <i>difficile</i> infection (CDI) is broad-spectrum antibiotics, which lead to low microbial diversity, or dysbiosis.
NA,Current therapeutic strategies for CDI are insufficient, as they do not address the key role of the microbiome in preventing <i>C. difficile</i> spore germination into toxin-producing vegetative bacteria, which leads to symptomatic disease.
NA,Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) appears to reduce the risk of recurrent CDI through microbiome restoration.
NA,However, a wide range of efficacy rates have been reported, and few placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, limiting our understanding of FMT efficacy and safety.
NA,We discuss the current knowledge gaps driven by questions around the quality and consistency of clinical trial results, patient selection, diagnostic methodologies, use of suppressive antibiotic therapy, and methods for adverse event reporting.
NA,We provide specific recommendations for future trial designs of FMT to provide improved quality of the clinical evidence to better inform treatment guidelines.
NA,The prevalence and prognosis of digestive system involvement, including gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury, in patients with COVID-19 remains largely unknown.
NA,We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system.
NA,In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020.
NA,The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched.
NA,We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients, and excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (&lt;10 cases).
NA,Extracted data included author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching; and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases.
NA,Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates.
NA,We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2-5; range 0-15; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=74%).
NA,The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10-21; range: 2-57; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms.
NA,The pooled prevalence of abnormal liver functions (12 studies, n=1267) was 19% (9-32; range 1-53; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=96%).
NA,Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1·60 [95% CI 1·09-2·36]; p=0·0020; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=44%) and liver injury (2·20 [1·60-3·02]; p&lt;0·00001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=36%) compared with those with non-severe disease.
NA,Patients in Hubei province, where the initial COVID-19 outbreak occurred, were more likely to present with abnormal liver functions (p&lt;0·0001) compared with those outside of Hubei.
NA,Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients.
NA,10% (95% CI 4-19; range 3-23; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features.
NA,Patients who presented with gastrointestinal system involvement had delayed diagnosis (standardised mean difference 2·85 [95% CI 0·22-5·48]; p=0·030; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=73%).
NA,Patients with gastrointestinal involvement had a higher prevalence of complication (OR 2·51 [95% CI 1·62-3·89]; p&lt;0·0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%).
NA,Our study showed that digestive symptoms and liver injury are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Increased attention should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients.
NA,None.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide.
NA,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
NA,The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers.
NA,The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions.
NA,This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe.
NA,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
NA,Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
NA,In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
NA,Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
NA,We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who was diagnosed with herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The diagnosis was somehow delayed because relatives were initially cautious in bringing the patient to the hospital and, here, the work-up focus was on coronavirusrelated aspects as the patient was initially reputed to be infected with COVID-19.
NA,During the current viral outbreak, physicians should not neglect the possibility of other diseases that represent neurological emergencies and require immediate recognition and treatment.
NA,The first cases of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, and rapidly become a public health emergency of international proportions.
NA,The disease may cause mild-to-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.
NA,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache.
NA,This article is a narrative review with the aim of analyzing the current literature on postviral olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.
NA,Since the initial anecdotal reports from China, international reports on COVID-19 patients have been increasing, describing a 5% to 85% range of loss of smell.
NA,To date, the literature is widely heterogeneous regarding the loss of smell; therefore, we advise home isolation measures and/or social distancing, and to carry out diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 when possible in those patients with sudden and severe loss of smell who cannot be promptly evaluated.
NA,The timely and accurate diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains the cornerstone of efforts to provide appropriated treatment for patients, to limit further spread of the virus and ultimately to eliminate the virus from the human society.
NA,We focus this article on (a) developments for improvement of diagnosis of specific SARS-CoV-2 virus, (b) laboratory changes in the immunologic and coagulation system, (c) therapeutic options for anticoagulant treatment of seriously affected patients and (d) on the perspectives through improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared in the last weeks as the global pandemics.
NA,Currently affecting more than 3,000,000 individuals worldwide, COVID-19 is most commonly associated with symptoms caused by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,As the number of infected individuals increases, we are learning that not only lungs, but also other organs can be affected by the virus.
NA,The gastrointestinal symptoms, like for example diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, or abdominal pain are frequent in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Moreover, alimentary tract symptoms may precede the respiratory presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,This can lead to delayed diagnosis and inappropriate management of infected patients.
NA,In addition, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in faeces of infected patients and rectal swabs are even reported to remain positive for a longer period of time than nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Here, we aim to provide an update on the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 presenting the symptoms that can be encountered in infected patients.
NA,We address the role of ACE2, as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which also was found in the gastrointestinal tract.
NA,Finally, we briefly discuss faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
NA,Evaluation of a diagnostic algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19 in patients who are referred to an emergency department for being suspected of having the disease.
NA,Retrospective study.
NA,Patients with fever with no apparent cause and patients with recently developed respiratory symptoms, whether or not in combination with fever, were routinely given a PCR test, blood tests (lymphocyte count and LDH levels) and a chest CT scan.
NA,The CT scan was assessed according to the CO-RADS classification.
NA,Based on the findings, the patients were divided into 3 cohorts (proven COVID-19, strong suspicion of COVID-19, and low suspicion of COVID-19) and the appropriate isolation measures were taken.
NA,In the period from 8 to 31 March 2020, the algorithm was applied to 312 patients.
NA,COVID-19 was proven for 69 (22%) patients.
NA,COVID-19 was strongly suspected for 151 (48%) patients and suspicion was low for the remaining 92 (29%) patients.
NA,The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased.
NA,Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels.
NA,We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings.
NA,In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans.
NA,Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as 'proven COVID-19 patients' using the algorithm.
NA,Deep learning (DL) has proved successful in medical imaging and, in the wake of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, some works have started to investigate DLbased solutions for the assisted diagnosis of lung diseases.
NA,While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images.
NA,Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, videolevel, and pixel-level (segmentation masks).
NA,Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images.
NA,In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way.
NA,Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level.
NA,Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers.
NA,Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread worldwide.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1).
NA,That same day, the first confirmed COVID-19-associated fatality occurred in New York City (NYC).
NA,To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
NA,Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths.
NA,As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3).
NA,Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic.
NA,The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death.
NA,The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths also does not include deaths that are not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death.
NA,Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5).
NA,Reporting of excess deaths might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.
NA,To investigate the clinical features of COVID-19 cases in Suzhou China.
NA,Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification.
NA,Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included.
NA,The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups.
NA,A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6 ± 14 years, and 45 patients were male.
NA,All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group.
NA,WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower.
NA,The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors.
NA,There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (P &lt; 0.05).
NA,However, NLR of the severe group was higher than the mild/moderate on days 1, 4 and 14 (P &lt; 0.01), and so was D-dimer on days 1, 7 and 14 (P &lt; 0.05).
NA,The common COVID-19 abnormal hematological indexes on admission included hyperfibrinogenemia, lymphopenia, the elevation of D-dimer, and leukopenia, which were significantly different between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups.
NA,Furthermore, the dynamic change of NLR and D-dimer level can distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from the mild/moderate.
NA,Accumulating evidence shows that microbial co-infection increases the risk of disease severity in humans.
NA,There have been few studies about SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with other pathogens.
NA,In this retrospective study, 257 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu Province were enrolled from January 22 to February 2, 2020.
NA,They were re-confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and tested for 39 respiratory pathogens.
NA,In total, 24 respiratory pathogens were found among the patients, and 242 (94.2 %) patients were co-infected with one or more pathogens.
NA,Bacterial co-infections were dominant in all COVID-19 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
NA,The highest and lowest rates of co-infections were found in patients aged 15-44 and below 15, respectively.
NA,Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease.
NA,In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases.
NA,These results will provide a helpful reference for diagnosis and clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients.
NA,To develop a deep learning-based method to assist radiologists to fast and accurately identify patients with COVID-19 by CT images.
NA,We retrospectively collected chest CT images of 495 patients from three hospitals in China. 495 datasets were randomly divided into 395 cases (80%, 294 of COVID-19, 101 of other pneumonia) of the training set, 50 cases (10%, 37 of COVID-19, 13 of other pneumonia) of the validation set and 50 cases (10%, 37 of COVID-19, 13 of other pneumonia) of the testing set.
NA,We trained a multi-view fusion model using deep learning network to screen patients with COVID-19 using CT images with the maximum lung regions in axial, coronal and sagittal views.
NA,The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by both the validation and testing sets.
NA,The multi-view deep learning fusion model achieved the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.732, accuracy of 0.700, sensitivity of 0.730 and specificity of 0.615 in validation set.
NA,In the testing set, we can achieve AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.819, 0.760, 0.811 and 0.615 respectively.
NA,Based on deep learning method, the proposed diagnosis model trained on multi-view images of chest CT images showed great potential to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and mitigate the heavy workload of radiologists for the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused about 2 million infections and is responsible for more than 100,000 deaths worldwide.
NA,To date, there is no specific drug registered to combat the disease it causes, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In the current study, we used an in silico approach to screen natural compounds to find potent inhibitors of the host enzyme transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
NA,This enzyme facilitates viral particle entry into host cells, and its inhibition blocks virus fusion with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
NA,This, in turn, restricts SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
NA,A three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was built using SWISS-MODEL and validated by RAMPAGE.
NA,The natural compounds library Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS), containing 30,927 compounds, was screened against the target protein.
NA,Two techniques were used in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) for this purpose, i.e., a ligand-based pharmacophore approach and a molecular docking-based screening.
NA,In total, 2140 compounds with pharmacophoric features were retained using the first approach.
NA,Using the second approach, 85 compounds with molecular docking comparable to or greater than that of the standard inhibitor (camostat mesylate) were identified.
NA,The top 12 compounds with the most favorable structural features were studied for physicochemical and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties.
NA,The low-molecular-weight compound NPC306344 showed significant interaction with the active site residues of TMPRSS2, with a binding energy score of -14.69.
NA,Further in vitro and in vivo validation is needed to study and develop an anti-COVID-19 drug based on the structures of the most promising compounds identified in this study.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel and highly contagious disease caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Older adults and patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions may experience severe signs and symptoms that can lead to death.
NA,This case series assesses the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for 12 patients with COVID-19 and a history of kidney transplantation.
NA,Patients were evaluated for symptoms, laboratory data, imaging findings, and outcomes from February 2020 to April 2020.
NA,Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12) of the patients, respectively.
NA,Most of the patients had a normal white blood cell count, while 33.3% (four/12) had leukopenia and 8.3% (one/12) had leukocytosis.
NA,A combination of consolidation and ground glass opacity was the most predominant (75%) pattern of lung involvement on computed tomography (CT).
NA,Eight patients died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and four were discharged.
NA,All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT.
NA,It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients.
NA,Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients.
NA,Coronaviruses are revealed to target the human respiratory system mainly.
NA,However, they also have neuro-invasive abilities and might spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system.
NA,Herein, we report four patients with COVID-19 simultaneously diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.
NA,There were four stroke cases with simultaneously diagnosis of Covid-19 till the April 14, 2020 in the city of Sakarya, Turkey.
NA,They were aged between 45 and 77 years.
NA,All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in Sakarya.
NA,The patients had all commonly reported symptoms of Covid-19.
NA,Three patients have elevated D-dimer levels, and two of them had high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.
NA,They were managed symptomatically for both the infection and the stroke.
NA,Our findings suggest that ischemic cerebrovascular diseases may simultaneously develop in the course of Covid-19 independently of the critical disease process.
NA,Increased inflammation predicted by CRP and D-dimer levels may play a role in the formation of ischemia.
NA,In particular, elder patients with prothrombotic risk factors should also be considered for the signs of cerebrovascular events in addition to infectious symptoms.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with a high asymptomatic incidence.
NA,Asymptomatic infections within a population will inevitably lead to diagnosis via unrelated medical imaging.
NA,We report the case of an asymptomatic patient undergoing a spine CT examination for trauma who was incidentally found to have lung abnormalities later confirmed to be COVID-19.
NA,We aim to familiarize neuroradiologists with the spectrum of COVID-19 pulmonary manifestations that are likely to be observed on neck and spine CT imaging.
NA,Point-of-care ultrasound has an important role in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,Because the utility of each application varies by setting, individual institutions should consider how they can best use ultrasound within their specific environments.
NA,In general, procedural guidance and focused echocardiography are high yield.
NA,Lung ultrasound has the potential to aid the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,Lower extremity point-of-care ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis may help guide decision making regarding anticoagulation or undifferentiated shock.
NA,It is of the utmost priority that ultrasound not spread infection, so point-of-care ultrasound must be used only when clinically indicated.
NA,Institutions should have protocols for machine disinfection.
NA,At present, there are no firm guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19-related emotional distress.
NA,The current approach is based on our knowledge of how to manage anxiety in medically ill patients, taking into consideration all associated medical comorbidities, drug-drug interactions, and the patient's specific needs and preexisting mental illness.
NA,Interventions should be implemented at the bedside to augment the patient's own resiliency in coping with these stressful events.
NA,A targeted combination of psychopharmacology (targeting acute anxiety and panic symptoms) and psychotherapy (relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and encouragement) is recommended.
NA,Background Clinical characteristics of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present differently within and outside the epicenter of Wuhan, China.
NA,More clinical investigations are needed.
NA,Objective The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapeutic methods of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, China.
NA,Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People's Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China.
NA,Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis.
NA,Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included.
NA,The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
NA,Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments.
NA,Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men.
NA,The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days.
NA,Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19.
NA,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group.
NA,Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count.
NA,The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%).
NA,Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon α2b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription.
NA,The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-α2b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously.
NA,Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.
NA,We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-α2b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.
NA,Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like SARS-CoV-2, which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent.
NA,We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020.
NA,This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas.
NA,Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions.
NA,More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients.
NA,Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED/inpatients tested were positive.
NA,The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged &lt;25 years old (2%).
NA,County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions.
NA,Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Data extracted for BSWH from the CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared to 25% in March 2019.
NA,This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management.
NA,This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population.
NA,Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.

NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1].
NA,It started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, after which quickly spread to many other countries around the world.
NA,Chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) play key roles in managment and diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,In this case series we are presenting three patients with predominant left-sided changes caused by COVID-19 infection.
NA,After its origin in Wuhan, China, coronavirus related respiratory illness spread across the globe, being declared as a pandemic by WHO on March 13, 2020.
NA,Because it is acquired via respiratory droplets, community spread is responsible for the recent global crisis.
NA,The current diagnostic options include real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a few serology tests, including but not limited to the recently approved five minutes serology tests.
NA,The disease presents as a lower respiratory tract illness.
NA,Anecdotal experiences have shown that imaging characteristics are crucial to diagnosis as radiological evidence of disease appears prior to clinical manifestations and tends to evolve over time, which can be useful in predicting the stage of the disease.
NA,CT scan is more sensitive than a chest X-ray in highlighting these changes.
NA,The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests.
NA,Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses.
NA,Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV).
NA,Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged.
NA,Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis.
NA,The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations.
NA,In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs.
NA,The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings.
NA,While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.
NA,During global health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, the decontamination of single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) becomes a necessary means to keep up with the growing demand from healthcare workers and patients alike.
NA,Many unverified methods are being considered, which can pose the risk of incomplete decontamination and lead to catastrophic results.
NA,Several factors come into play when determining the suitability of such methods including the quality of the decontamination technique, the targeted pathogen, cost, ease of installation and use, rate of sterilization, and the surface or material to be sterilized.
NA,The germicidal properties of ultraviolet-C are well known.
NA,This review will cover the most commonly described methods for the sterilization of N95 respirators, namely, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vaporization, microwave-generated steaming, and dry heating.
NA,These techniques have been tested previously and have demonstrated efficacy in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens, although testing against SARS-CoV-2 specifically has not been done.
NA,Moreover, it must be emphasized that proper disposal after a single use is still ideal under normal circumstances.
NA,The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hit health-care systems and societies in an unprecedented manner.
NA,In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic.
NA,With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places.
NA,Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests.
NA,COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being &quot;with&quot; rather than &quot;by&quot; SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands.
NA,To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising.
NA,For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown.
NA,Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated.
NA,The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited.
NA,Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results.
NA,Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,While the spread of COVID-19 is increased, new, automatic, and reliable methods for accurate detection are essential to reduce the exposure of the medical experts to the outbreak.
NA,X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis.
NA,In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered.
NA,Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images.
NA,Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task.
NA,A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks.
NA,Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19.
NA,A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved.
NA,Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.
NA,The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.
NA,By April 7th, 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected one and a half million people worldwide, accounting for over 80 thousand of deaths in 209 countries and territories around the world.
NA,The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries.
NA,In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries.
NA,Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea.
NA,Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic.
NA,Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic.
NA,In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above.
NA,The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases.
NA,In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy.
NA,In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively.
NA,This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing.
NA,In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.
NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Multiple studies suggest CT should be a primary diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because they reported sensitivities with CT far superior to that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.
NA,This review aimed to assess these reports and found chest CT to have a clinical utility that is limited, particularly for patients who show no symptoms and patients who are screened early in disease progression. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Chest CT should be considered a supplemental diagnostic tool, particularly for patients who show symptoms.
NA,The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic represents a once in a century challenge to human healthcare with 2.4 million cases and 165,000 deaths thus far.
NA,Surgical practice has been significantly impacted with all specialties writing guidelines for how to manage during this crisis.
NA,All specialties have had to triage the urgency of their daily surgical procedures and consider non-surgical management options where possible.
NA,The Pandemic has had ramifications for ways of working, surgical techniques, open vs minimally invasive, theatre workflow, patient and staff safety, training and education.
NA,With guidelines specific to each specialty being implemented and followed, surgeons should be able to continue to provide safe and effective care to their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In this comprehensive and up to date review we assess changes to working practices through the lens of each surgical specialty.
NA,In a special issue that focuses on complex presentations related to Autism, we ask the question in this editorial whether an Autism Spectrum Condition without complexity is a disorder, or whether it represents human diversity?
NA,Much research into Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) over the years has focused on comparisons between neuro-typical people and people with Autism Spectrum Conditions.
NA,These comparisons have tended to draw attention to 'deficits' in cognitive abilities and descriptions of behaviours that are characterised as unwanted.
NA,Not surprisingly, this is reflected in the classification systems from the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association.
NA,Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability.
NA,Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences.
NA,We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively.
NA,Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The most terrifying thing about pandemic could be the large number of patients running against the health service system, which causes a serious shortage of health resources, especially medical personnel.
NA,Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics.
NA,Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak.
NA,China provides solutions by adopting nationwide &quot;pairing assistance&quot; measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area.
NA,By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing &quot;pairing assistance&quot; is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.
NA,To illustrate the clinical course and difficulties in early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients after thoracic surgery.
NA,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of the first 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after thoracic surgery in early January 2020.
NA,Postoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records and the time line of clinical course were summarized.
NA,Potential prognostic factors were evaluated.
NA,In the 11 confirmed cases (3 female, 8 male), median days from symptom onset to case detection was 8.
NA,Insidious symptom onset and misinterpreted postoperative changes on chest computed tomography (CT) resulted in delay in diagnosis.
NA,There were 3 fatalities due to respiratory failure, whereas 4 severe and 4 mild cases recovered and were discharged.
NA,All patients had once experienced leukocytosis and eosinopenia.
NA,Remittent fever and resected lung segments ≥5 were associated with fatality.
NA,The case fatality rate of postsurgical patients subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 was 27.3%.
NA,Insidious symptom onset, postoperative leukocytosis with lymphopenia, and postsurgical CT changes overshadowed the early signs of viral pneumonia.
NA,Dynamic symptom monitoring, serial chest CTs, and tests for viral RNA and serum antibody improve the chance for prompt detection of COVID-19.
NA,Consideration should be given to preadmission and preoperative screening and strict contact isolation during the postoperative period.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to delays in the treatment of many urologic cancers.
NA,To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage.
NA,A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020.
NA,Patients with low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3-6-month delay.
NA,Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
NA,Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged.
NA,Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).
NA,Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3-6 mo without change in outcomes.
NA,The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression.
NA,With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care.
NA,For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach.
NA,Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (≥T3) should be treated expeditiously.
NA,Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy.
NA,Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage.
NA,For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes.
NA,Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer.
NA,In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of ≥3 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy.
NA,Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers.
NA,Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies.
NA,Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.
NA,Among the many facets of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the unprecedented pressure it has placed on different points of the supply chain for hospital systems worldwide such as collection devices for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,….
NA,Public discussion and health-care systems worldwide have been focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Does it have an impact on cancer care today?
NA,The PRIO (&quot;Prevention and Integrative Oncology&quot;) Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020.
NA,Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires.
NA,The survey is ongoing.
NA,We present the first data.
NA,A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life.
NA,A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted.
NA,Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients.
NA,Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients.
NA,Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves.
NA,There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management.
NA,After only a few weeks, human resources are limited.
NA,They will be the most important key for further health-care services for patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.
NA,The purpose of this article was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for detecting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched up to March 12, 2020.
NA,We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 detection.
NA,The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.
NA,Sensitivity and specificity were pooled.
NA,Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included.
NA,The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general.
NA,Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86-96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22-30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23-44%], respectively).
NA,There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochran's Q test (p &lt; 0.01) and Higgins I<sup>2</sup> heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity).
NA,After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively).
NA,In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%.
NA,Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation.
NA,However, the specificity is low.
NA,In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.
NA,• Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.
NA,The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), represents a major challenge for healthcare.
NA,The involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID‑19 has been proven and increased healthcare system resources are redirected towards handling infected patients, which induces major changes in access to services and prioritization in the management of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease unrelated to COVID‑19.
NA,In this expert opinion, conceived by the task force involving the Working Groups on Valvular Heart Diseases and Cardiac Surgery as well as the Association of Cardiovascular Intervention of the Polish Cardiac Society, modification of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare personnel protection, and treatment guidelines regarding triage and prioritization are suggested.
NA,Heart Teams responsible for the treatment of valvular heart disease should continue their work using telemedicine and digital technology.
NA,Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize the number of potentially dangerous aerosol‑generating procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging.
NA,The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis.
NA,Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists.
NA,In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease.
NA,Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder‑based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ‑of ‑the ‑art cardiovascular services.
NA,Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Italy has been one of the most affected countries in Europe and the second for number of deaths.
NA,In this commentary, we discuss some lessons that we learned as healthcare providers working in a large public hospital during the pandemic, with a special focus on the importance of infection containment and early diagnosis, the role of swab, serological tests, home isolation and individual protection devices,  and the available therapies and management indications to better face a possible new outbreak in the near future.
NA,These comments should stimulate a more diffused, efficient and efficacious management of COVID-19 patients, also reducing the number of accesses to hospital emergency departments and the related spread of the infection.
NA,Many COVID-19 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus develop pneumonia (called novel coronavirus pneumonia, NCP) and rapidly progress to respiratory failure.
NA,However, rapid diagnosis and identification of high-risk patients for early intervention are challenging.
NA,Using a large computed tomography (CT) database from 3,777 patients, we developed an AI system that can diagnose NCP and differentiate it from other common pneumonia and normal controls.
NA,The AI system can assist radiologists and physicians in performing a quick diagnosis especially when the health system is overloaded.
NA,Significantly, our AI system identified important clinical markers that correlated with the NCP lesion properties.
NA,Together with the clinical data, our AI system was able to provide accurate clinical prognosis that can aid clinicians to consider appropriate early clinical management and allocate resources appropriately.
NA,We have made this AI system available globally to assist the clinicians to combat COVID-19.
NA,A new betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and economy.
NA,A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein.
NA,By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins.
NA,We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities.
NA,However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1.
NA,Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
NA,Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system.
NA,The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.
NA,We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer.
NA,We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.
NA,Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS.
NA,Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression.
NA,Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache.
NA,Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission.
NA,Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization.
NA,In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels.
NA,These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression.
NA,Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS.
NA,These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease.
NA,The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS.
NA,Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.
NA,Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) technique used for its portability, widespread availability, and ability to provide real-time diagnostic information procedural guidance.
NA,LUS outperforms lung auscultation and chest X-ray, and is an alternative to chest computed tomography in select cases.
NA,Cardiologists may enhance their physical and echocardiographic examination with the addition of LUS.
NA,We present a practical guide to LUS, including device selection, scanning, findings, and interpretation.
NA,We outline a 3-point scanning protocol using 2D and M-mode imaging to evaluate the pleural line, pleural space, and parenchyma.
NA,We describe LUS findings and interpretation for common causes of respiratory failure.
NA,We provide guidance specific of COVID-19, which at the time of writing is responsible for a global pandemic.
NA,In this context, LUS emerges as a particularly useful tool for the diagnosis and management of patients with cardiopulmonary disease.
NA,COVID 19 pandemic is a worldwide health emergency.
NA,Every single Hospital and Department was forced to radically modify clinical practice decreasing or stopping daily activities.
NA,Oncological patients had to carry on treatments in order to prevent disease progression and improve their quality of life.
NA,However, many health workers may be a potential source of infection if not tested with swabs but this diagnostic procedure was not suitable universally in Italy.
NA,Aiming to reduce hospitalization of our patients with advanced lung cancer, vinorelbine in its metronomic formulation is one of the best strategy.
NA,Here, we report the experience with oral vinorelbine in a few patients of our Oncology Department.
NA,Rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental to assess viral spread and limit the pandemic we are facing.
NA,In this study, we compared direct rRT-PCR method (without RNA extraction) using SeeGene AllplexTM 2019-nCoV rRT-PCR with the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR kit (Altona Diagnostics).
NA,Furthermore, we assessed the impact of swab storage media composition on PCR efficiency.
NA,We show that SeeGene and Altona's assays provide similar efficiency.
NA,Importantly, we provide evidence that RNA extraction can be successfully bypassed when samples are stored in UTM medium or in molecular water but not when samples are stored in saline solution and in Hanks medium.
NA,Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals with past coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Our study is the first to compare four new commercially available assays using 75 sera from patients tested positive or negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR: the anti SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun, Germany), the EDI New Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA, (Epitope diagnostics (EDI), USA), the recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Mikrogen, Germany), and the SARS-CoV-2 Virachip IgG (Viramed, Germany).
NA,We found a sensitivity of 86.4 %, 100 %, 86.4 %, and 77.3 % and a specificity of 96,2 %, 88,7 %, 100 %, and 100 % for the Euroimmun assay, the EDI assay, the Mikrogen assay, and the Viramed assay, respectively.
NA,Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays have a sufficient specificity and sensitivity for identifying individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society.
NA,Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).
NA,Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed.
NA,The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene).
NA,We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95).
NA,Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity.
NA,Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity.
NA,PCR efficiency was ≥96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range.
NA,Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits.
NA,Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.
NA,We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.
NA,Concerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19; however, epidemiological evidence is lacking.
NA,We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020.
NA,As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018).
NA,We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls.
NA,The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19.
NA,To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs.
NA,We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression.
NA,The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437.
NA,We collected data for 1139 cases and 11 390 population controls.
NA,Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls.
NA,Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15).
NA,No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37).
NA,Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80).
NA,The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.
NA,RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.
NA,Instituto de Salud Carlos III.
NA,The nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important antigen for coronavirus, which participate in RNA package and virus particle release.
NA,In this study, we expressed the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and characterized its biochemical properties.
NA,Static light scattering, size exclusive chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that the purified N protein is largely a dimer in solution.
NA,CD spectra showed that it has a high percentage of disordered region at room temperature while it was best structured at 55 °C, suggesting its structural dynamics.
NA,Fluorescence polarization assay showed it has non-specific nucleic acid binding capability, which raised a concern in using it as a diagnostic marker.
NA,Immunoblot assays confirmed the presence of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies against N antigen in COVID-19 infection patients' sera, proving the importance of this antigen in host immunity and diagnostics.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is emerged in China on December 2019 and now declared pandemic by WHO.
NA,We describe the case of an Italian 7-week-old suckling baby SARS-CoV-2-positive only by cell culture method with no clinical suspicion and/or risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The patient was referred to the hospital with signs and symptoms of infection of the upper respiratory tract before the virus was spread to the province.
NA,Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,Bacteria referred to resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs.
NA,No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate.
NA,The baby was discharged in good conditions after 3 days of hospitalization.
NA,Later a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR performed both on cell culture and on the stored aliquot of the original sample.
NA,The virus isolate was named SARS-Cov-2/human/Parma/1/2020.
NA,Cell culture still remains the only reference diagnostic method also for emerging viruses, allowing to reveal cytopathogenic viruses and demonstrating their infectivity.
NA,With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, rapid diagnostics are paramount to contain the current pandemic.
NA,The routinely used realtime RT-PCR is sensitive, specific and able to process large batches of samples.
NA,However, turnaround time is long and in cases where fast obtained results are critical, molecular point of care tests (POCT) can be an alternative.
NA,Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test.
NA,The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands.
NA,A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses.
NA,Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges.
NA,Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL.
NA,Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected.
NA,In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs CONCLUSION: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence.
NA,Pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is the largest of its kind of this century.
NA,All countries throughout the globe are trying their best to contain the disease and eliminate at the earliest.
NA,Efforts are continuing to improve the outcome of the infection in terms of minimizing the morbidity and mortality.
NA,As a public health strategy every state has the responsibility of protecting the health of the community and such measures includes the preventive measures like social distancing or even lockdown of the state as a whole restricting the movement of the people, diagnostic measures like testing the suspects, contact tracing and isolation of the patients.
NA,Treatment of the infected requires decisions in resource constraint situation particularly ICU beds and ventilators.
NA,In the meantime, protecting doctors, nurses, other health workers as well as frontline workers need personal protective equipment which is a scarce commodity.
NA,While doing so there might be a compromise in the individual autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, and social justice for the beneficence for the larger community.
NA,This is an attempt to explore the ethical quandaries in relation to combating COVID-19 in Nepal by relating the issues with the principles of biomedical ethics.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the relationship between novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and kidney injury. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 confirmed patients in the Central Theater Command General Hospital of Chinese PLA on March 12, 2020.
NA,A total of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed patients were enrolled in the study, and they were hospitalized at least one week.
NA,The recorded information included clinical data and indicators of kidney-related laboratory tests. <b>Results:</b> The average age of patients was (65.2±17.1) years, and 34.5% (30/87) patients were ≥ 75 years old and 31.0% (27/87) patients were 60~74 years old.
NA,Male and female patients accounted for 59.8% (52/87) and 40.2% (35/87), respectively.
NA,There were 29.9% (26/87) and 12.6% (11/87) patients who had already showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) at admission.
NA,Moreover, 25.3% (22/87) and 4.6% (4/87) patients still exhibited mild elevation of BUN and SCr one week after admission.
NA,However, 28.7% (25/87) patients showed an elevation of BUN one week later after admission, though their BUN levels were normal at admission.
NA,Likewise, 16.1% (14/87) patients showed an elevation of SCr one week later after admission, while their SCr levels were normal at admission.
NA,Only two patients had an increase of SCr ≥26.5 μmol/L, and both of them were over 75 years old. <b>Conclusions:</b> COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon.
NA,However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）与肾损伤的关系。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 收集2020年3月12日当天正在解放军中部战区总医院感染内科住院的87例COVID-19确诊患者入院时和入院1周后的临床资料及肾脏相关实验室检查结果，并进行回顾性分析。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 患者年龄（65.2±17.1）岁，其中男性占59.8%（52/87），女性占40.2%（35/87），75岁及以上的患者占比34.5%（30/87），60~74岁占比31.0%（27/87）。
NA,入院时患者即存在血尿素氮（BUN）和血清肌酐（SCr）升高的比例分别为29.9%（26/87）和12.6%（11/87），入院1周后上述指标异常的比例分别为25.3%（22/87）和4.6%（4/87）。
NA,入院时BUN正常，1周后较入院时升高的患者占比28.7%（25/87）。
NA,入院时SCr正常，1周后较入院时升高的患者占比16.1%（14/87），升高幅度≥26.5 μmol/L的患者仅2例，均为75岁以上老年人。
NA,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19患者严重肾损伤的情况并不多见，新型冠状病毒导致急性肾损伤的可能性较小，但应注意COVID-19老年患者在诊疗过程中可能合并的肾损伤。.
NA,Back-projection is an epidemiological analysis method that was developed to estimate HIV incidence using surveillance data on AIDS diagnoses.
NA,It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts.
NA,Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period.
NA,This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia.
NA,It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns.
NA,For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels.
NA,These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures.
NA,It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections.
NA,Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed.
NA,Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.
NA,Patients treated for malignancy are considered at risk of severe COVID-19.
NA,This exceptional pandemic has affected countries on every level, particularly health systems which are experiencing saturation.
NA,Like many countries, France is currently greatly exposed, and a complete reorganization of hospitals is ongoing.
NA,We propose here adaptations of diagnostic procedures, therapies and care strategies for patients treated for digestive cancer during the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,French societies of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) oncology carried out this study to answer two main questions that have arisen (i) how can we limit high-risk situations for GI-cancer patients and (ii) how can we limit contact between patients and care centers to decrease patients' risk of contamination while continuing to treat their cancer.
NA,All recommendations are graded as experts' agreement according to the level of evidence found in the literature until March 2020.
NA,A proposal to adapt treatment strategies was made for the main GI oncology situations.
NA,Considering the level of evidence and the heterogeneous progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, all proposals need to be considered by a multidisciplinary team and implemented with patient consent.
NA,COVID-19 epidemic may significantly affect patients treated for digestive malignancies.
NA,Healthcare teams need to consider adapting treatment sequences when feasible and according to the epidemic situation.
NA,The purpose of testing for any communicable disease is to support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of individual patients and to describe transmission dynamics.
NA,The novel coronavirus is formally named SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease state resulting from an infection is known as COVID-19.
NA,Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health officials to utilise the most comprehensive, accurate and timely information available to manage the rapidly evolving COVID-19 environment.
NA,High performance sport is a unique context that may look towards comprehensive testing as a means of risk mitigation.
NA,Characteristics of the common testing options are discussed including the circumstances where additional testing may be of benefit and considerations for the associated risks.
NA,Finally, a review of the available technology that could be considered for use by medical staff at the point of care (PoC) in a high-performance sporting context is included.
NA,Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on anal swabs was recently reported to be persistently positive even after throat testing was negative during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
NA,However, data about the consistent performance of RT-PCR assay on throat and anal swabs remain limited in pediatric patients.
NA,Here, we retrospectively reviewed RT-PCR-testing results of 212 pediatric patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at Wuhan Children's Hospital.
NA,The diagnostic potential of these two types of specimens were showed significant difference (positive rate: 78.2% on throat swabs vs.
NA,52.6% on anal swabs, McNemar Test <i>P</i>=0.0091) and exhibited a weak positive consistency (Kappa value was 0.311, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001) in pediatric patients.
NA,Furthermore, viral loads detected on both throat and anal swabs also showed no significant difference (<i>P</i> = 0.9511) and correlation (Pearson r = 0.0434, <i>P</i> = 0.8406), and exhibited an inconsistent kinetic change through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Besides, viral loads in the throat and anal swabs were correlated with different types of immune states, immune-reactive phase, and the resolution phase/immunologic tolerance, respectively.
NA,These findings revealed that RT-PCR-testing on throat and anal swabs showed significant difference for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlated with different immune state in pediatric patients.
NA,We report a young Thai man from the Thai-Myanmar border suffering from 2 days of fever and myalgia without respiratory tract signs or symptoms.
NA,He reported no history of travel through an area with confirmed COVID-19 cases or contact with sick persons.
NA,After excluding malaria and dengue, which are common causative agents of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) in Thailand, chest radiography was performed according to the patient triage protocol of our institute for AUFI during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Chest radiography revealed findings compatible with pneumonia.
NA,Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.
NA,The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission.
NA,Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.
NA,This fact necessitates vigilant awareness in clinical investigation, management, and infection control, especially in tropical resource-limited settings.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) pandemic is rapidly developing across the globe and new information is emerging expeditiously and constantly, particularly in relation to neurological illnesses.
NA,Both central and peripheral nervous system involvement has been reported including headache, dizziness, hyposmia/anosmia, taste disturbances, seizures, stroke, alteration of the sensorium, and even acute hemorrhagic necrotizing leukoencephalopathy.
NA,Varying degrees of olfactory disturbances may pre-empt the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Although no direct effect of 2019 nCoV has been reported yet on Parkinson's disease, there are enormous possible indirect effects and implications.
NA,We examine the potential effects and challenges posed by this pandemic to individuals with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the Indian context where telecommunication access or support group access may be lacking for these patients.
NA,Additionally, lockdown and social distancing may pose hurdles in the provision of optimum medical therapy, particularly if patients experience motor and non-motor deteriorations due to diverse reasons.
NA,Given incomplete data reporting by race, we used data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in US counties to describe racial disparities in COVID-19 disease and death and associated determinants.
NA,Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (&gt;13%) black and all other (&lt;13% black) counties.
NA,Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model.
NA,National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated.
NA,Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties.
NA,Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution.
NA,Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration.
NA,COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties.
NA,The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with &lt;13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with &gt;13% black residents.
NA,Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally.
NA,County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots.
NA,Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.
NA,Diabetic foot ulcers are among the most serious complications of diabetes.
NA,If left untreated, these ulcers can lead to severe infection and gangrene; in some instances, they may result in death.
NA,Thus, timely treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is extremely important.
NA,However, timely patient treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly challenging, because of the higher volume of patients and the need to ensure safety of medical personnel.
NA,This article describes a proposed strategy for diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, based on experiences with infection and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
NA,Since December, 2019, a 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, and the epidemic situation has continued to spread globally.
NA,The epidemic spread of COVID-19 has brought great challenges to the clinical practice of thoracic oncology.
NA,Outpatient clinics need to strengthen the differential diagnosis of initial symptoms, pulmonary ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, interstitial and/or interlobular septal thickening, and crazy paving appearance.
NA,In the routine of oncology, the differential diagnosis of adverse events from COVID-19 is also significant, including radiation pneumonitis, checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), neutropenic fever, and so on.
NA,During the epidemic, indications of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and CT-guided percutaneous thoracic biopsy are strictly controlled.
NA,For patients who are planning to undergo biopsy operation, screening to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 should be carried out.
NA,For confirmed or suspected patients, three-level protection should be performed during the operation.
NA,Disinfection and isolation measures should be strictly carried out during the operation.
NA,At last, more attention to the protection of cancer patients and give priority to the treatment of infected cancer patients.
NA,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, no data have been available for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have COVID-19.
NA,We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China.
NA,To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited.
NA,We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020.
NA,We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups.
NA,Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020.
NA,The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6).
NA,12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms.
NA,14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings.
NA,By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19.
NA,Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases.
NA,Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality.
NA,Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic.
NA,Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.
NA,Since late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, which is mainly characterized by pulmonary lesions, has spread quickly worldwide.
NA,With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the outpatient lines of hospitals have mostly shut down, which means that routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases patients have been disturbed.
NA,Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
NA,These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention.
NA,In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern.
NA,Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.
NA,The global context we are experiencing, characterized by the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, imposes strict containment, isolation and physical distance measures, necessary to control and contain the risk of contagion.
NA,Despite social distances and isolation in this context of threat to Global Health, the sharing of experiences, professionalism, scientific research and Public Health strategies is fundamental.
NA,Never before has telemedicine played a decisive role in supporting the healthcare organization, The University Hospital Consortium Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental partnership project with West China Hospital of Sichuan University through periodic and scheduled video conferences.
NA,The Company Strategic Management, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bari, Medical Executives of the Health Department, of the U.O of Infectious Diseases, Anesthesia and Resuscitation, Pulmonology, Emergency, Hygiene, Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Doctors Resident operating in the COVID Area. are involved in the Experimental Project., all adequately trained and instructed on the operating protocol.
NA,From the preliminary data of this study, it appears that the Bari Polyclinic has adopted the same therapeutic strategies started in China in the previous months, believing early diagnosis and treatment to be a strength in the battle against COVID-19.
NA,The project makes it possible to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, using the experience acquired in the field by Chinese doctors who, first caught by this health emergency, have obtained positive results.
NA,Laboratory medicine provides an almost irreplaceable contribution to the diagnostic reasoning and managed care of most human pathologies.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm.
NA,Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed.
NA,First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels.
NA,The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.
NA,Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far.
NA,As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.
NA,Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis.
NA,The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.
NA,Covid-19 infection is a multisystem disease more frequent in older individuals, especially in those with multiple chronic diseases.
NA,This multimorbid and frail population requires attention and a personalized comprehensive assessment in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes.
NA,As other diseases, the COVID-19 presentation in older patients is often atypical with less severe and unspecific symptoms.
NA,These subjects both at home and during hospitalization suffer isolation and the lack of support of caregivers.
NA,The geriatric care in COVID-19 wards is often missing.
NA,The application of additional instruments would be necessary to facilitate and personalize the clinical approach, not only based on diseases but also on functional status.
NA,This narrative review starts from diagnostic evaluation, continues with adapted pharmacologic treatment and ends with the recovery phase targeting the nutrition and physical exercise.
NA,We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastro-intestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners.
NA,As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease.
NA,Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection.
NA,We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function.
NA,This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.
NA,The global COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the largest clinical and operational challenges faced by emergency medicine, and our EDs continue to see increased volumes of infected patients, many of whom are not only ill, but acutely aware and fearful of their circumstances and potential mortality.
NA,Given this, there may be no more important time to focus on staff-patient communication and expression of compassion.However, many of the techniques usually employed by emergency clinicians to provide comfort to patients and their families are made more challenging or impossible by the current circumstances.
NA,Geriatric ED patients, who are at increased risk of severe disease, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of isolation.Despite many challenges, emergency clinicians have at their disposal a myriad of tools that can still be used to express compassion and empathy to their patients.
NA,Placing emphasis on using these techniques to maximize humanism in the care of COVID-19 patients during this crisis has the potential to bring improvements to ED patient care well after this pandemic has passed.
NA,Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) often have clinical characteristics, such as chest tightness and dyspnea.
NA,Continuous, unresolved dyspnea often indicates the progression of lung lesions.
NA,The mechanism that underlies the chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear.
NA,Chest CT has a higher sensitivity and can play an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
NA,However, our clinical observations showed that although some patients had significant chest distress and dyspnea, the lesions that were observed in the lungs during computed tomography were milder and not completely consistent with clinical symptoms.
NA,We analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, and imaging findings of these patients.
NA,We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients.
NA,Through this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI century.
NA,In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations.
NA,As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases.
NA,Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea.
NA,Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection.
NA,In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing.
NA,We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers.
NA,Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.
NA,The coronavirus pandemic outbreak is considered the most daunting public health challenge in decades.
NA,With no effective treatments and the time needed to develop a vaccine, alternatives approaches are followed to control such pandemic.
NA,To identify topics, opinions, and recommendations discussed by medical professionals about the coronavirus pandemic outbreak on social medial platform, Twitter.
NA,Using a mixed-method approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed coronavirus related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content.
NA,We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data in order to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the phenomenon using qualitative coding.
NA,Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions.
NA,Data was collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic.
NA,A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020.
NA,We identified eight topics, namely, actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, healthcare system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission.
NA,Tweets were mainly focused on actions and recommendations (28%) needed to control the pandemic.
NA,Many tweets warned about misleading information (20%) which could lead to more cases infected with the virus.
NA,Other tweets discussed general Knowledge and information (9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the healthcare systems and workers (9%).
NA,The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (8%), immunity (7%), testing (6%), and virus infection and transmission (5%).
NA,Findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms could help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during the pandemic outbreak.
NA,We report the first successful treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, in association with the most promising and available antiviral therapy, of a severe case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.
NA,This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe COVID-19 associated with remdesivir therapy.
NA,Further studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this combination strategy in the treatment of this emerging infection.
NA,Since December 2019, more than 3 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and about 200,000 deaths have been reported worldwide.
NA,The outbreak of this novel disease has become a global health emergency and continues to rapidly spread around the world.
NA,Based on the clinical data, approved cases are divided into four classes including mild, moderate, severe, and critical.
NA,About 5% of cases were considered critically ill and 14% were considered to have the severe classification of the disease.
NA,In China, the fatality rate of this infection was about 4%.
NA,This review focuses on currently available information on the etiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and mechanism of action of COVID-19.
NA,Furthermore, we present an overview of diagnostic approaches and treatment of this disease according to available findings.
NA,This review paper will help the physician to diagnose and successfully treat COVID-19.
NA,Amid the increasing number of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, there is a need for a quick and easy method to obtain a non-invasive sample for the detection of this novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2).
NA,We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,From 27 March to 4 April 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared.
NA,Two-hundred pairs of samples were collected.
NA,Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years.
NA,Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%.
NA,The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% (95% CI 60.4%-96.6%), and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%-99.9%), respectively.
NA,An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (κ coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p &lt; 0.001).
NA,Saliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating.
NA,This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance.
NA,To track the European spread of SARS-CoV-2, decentralized testing became necessary and test capacity needed to be expanded outside reference laboratories rapidly.
NA,We assessed via an online questionnaire the preparedness of European hospital laboratories for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and listed the main drawbacks for implementation.
NA,Forty-five percent of the surveyed labs had a test in place by March 26th which is well into the first wave of the pandemic in most countries.
NA,The main implementation barriers for introduction of a SARSCoV-2 molecular assay in European diagnostic laboratories were availability of positive controls and a specificity panel.
NA,Data about optimal initial assessment in patients with suspicion for COVID19-infection or already confirmed infection are sparse.
NA,Especially, in preparation for expected mass casualty incident it is necessary to distinguish early and efficiently between outpatient and inpatient treatment including the need for intensive care therapy.
NA,We present a model for a safe and efficient triage, which is established and used in the university hospital of Essen, Germany.
NA,It is intended for a non-disaster situation.
NA,This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS).
NA,Possible additional parameters are POCT (point-of-care-testing) values, electrocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiography, SARS-Cov2-PCR as well as detailed diagnostic of laboratory values.
NA,The model was validated by 100 consecutive patients.
NA,We demonstrate three patients to illustrate this model.
NA,During the first two weeks after implementing this model in our normal operation at the emergency department, we had an efficient selectivity between need for inpatient and outpatient treatment. 16 patients were classified as &quot;inpatients&quot; according to initial assessment.
NA,Among 84 patients who were initially classified as &quot;outpatients&quot;, 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days.
NA,Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19.
NA,One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea.
NA,This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept.
NA,Adjustment might be necessary after further experience and after a growing number of patients.
NA,Wenig ist bisher bekannt über die optimale Ersteinschätzung fußläufiger Patienten mit Verdacht auf COVID-19-Infektion oder bereits bestätigter Infektion.
NA,Insbesondere der zu erwartende Massenanfall von Erkrankten verlangt nach einer raschen, effizienten und sicheren Unterscheidung zwischen ambulanter Therapieführung, stationärer Überwachung und ggf.
NA,Intensivtherapie.
NA,Wir präsentieren das in der Universitätsmedizin Essen (UME) entwickelte und verwendete Modell einer möglichst sicheren und effizienten Triage außerhalb des Katastrophenfalls.
NA,Das beschriebene Modell der UME ist eine Kombination aus klinischer Einschätzung durch Vitalparameter und Manchester-Triage-Skala (MTS), optional ergänzt durch POCT-Labor, EKG, CT-Pulmonalisangiografie, SARS-CoV-2-PCR sowie ausführlichere Labordiagnostik.
NA,Es erfolgte eine Validierung anhand von 100 konsekutiven Patienten. 3 konkrete Patientenbeispiele verdeutlichen das Modell.
NA,Im Rahmen des Regelbetriebs ergab sich in den ersten 2 Wochen eine gute Trennschärfe zwischen stationär behandlungsbedürftigen und ambulanten Patienten.
NA,16 Patienten wurden primär stationär aufgenommen.
NA,Bei den 84 initial „ambulant“ klassifizierten Patienten kam es zu 7 Wiedervorstellungen binnen 14 Tagen, 3 hiervon aus anderen Gründen.
NA,Eine Patientin musste hierbei aufgrund von progredienter Dyspnoe stationär aufgenommen werden.
NA,Das vorgestellte Triage-Modell bewährt sich in der Praxis, wobei weitere Anpassungen je nach Erfahrung und Patientenanfall vorgesehen sind.
NA,The current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, which started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, is an ongoing challenge and a significant threat to public health requiring surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand a new, emergent, and unknown pathogen and to develop effective therapies.
NA,Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident.
NA,Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools.
NA,A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;nCov 19&quot;, and &quot;Sars Cov 2&quot;. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: &quot;death&quot;, &quot;died&quot;, &quot;comorbidity&quot;, &quot;cause of death&quot;, &quot;biopsy&quot;, &quot;autopsy&quot;, or &quot;pathological&quot;.
NA,A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria.
NA,However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data.
NA,The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%).
NA,Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies.
NA,The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer.
NA,The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock.
NA,Only 7 papers reported histological investigations.
NA,Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them.
NA,The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection.
NA,Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients.
NA,As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary.
NA,Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
NA,On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world.
NA,COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies.
NA,There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients.
NA,However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence.
NA,Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies.
NA,Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies.
NA,This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
NA,All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.
NA,The global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding the cardiovascular implications of coronavirus infections, with more severe disease in those with cardiovascular co-morbidities, and resulting cardiac manifestations such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
NA,A systematic review of the current knowledge on the effects of coronavirus infection on the cardiovascular system in humans was performed and results were summarized.
NA,Databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on 20 March 2020.
NA,In total, 135 studies were included, involving severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 and other coronaviruses.
NA,Most were case reports, case series and cohort studies of poor to fair quality.
NA,In post-mortem examinations of subjects who died from infection, around half had virus identified in heart tissues in severe acute respiratory syndrome, but none in Middle East respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment.
NA,Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death.
NA,In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
NA,There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions.
NA,This review highlighted the ways in which coronaviruses affect cardiovascular function and interacts with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.
NA,With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many novel presentations of known conditions are occurring.
NA,In the pediatric population, new instances of Kawasaki disease have recently been singled out as presenting in conjunction with or soon after diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,This poses a novel situation, particularly for otolaryngologists, who may be the first to encounter these patients.
NA,Otolaryngologists should be cognizant of the coexistence of conditions to allow for timely recognition and optimal management.
NA,Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery underwent drastic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Since March 10, the first day of the lockdown in Italy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergency and oncology cases, while outpatient procedures and clinical examinations were temporarily suspended to limit virus diffusion and to reallocate personnel into wards dedicated to COVID-19.
NA,In our otolaryngology unit, between March 10 and April 28, 2020, we performed 96 surgical procedures; they mainly consisted in diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors of the head and neck (77%), management of acute upper airway obstruction in adults and children (14.7%), drainage of abscesses of the head and neck (6.2%), and treatment of nasal bone fractures (2.1%).
NA,When comparing these data with those of the same period in 2019 for emergency and oncology procedures, we noticed a drastic reduction of head and neck abscesses and nasal bone fractures, while oncology surgery remained stable.
NA,Diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy (DFL) is a critical tool in the armamentarium of an otolaryngologist.
NA,However, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, DFL represents a high-risk procedure for patients and otolaryngologists due to the risk of aerosolization.
NA,In cases where DFL is required, in patients with COVID-19 positivity or unknown COVID-19 status, we describe the use of a modified endoscopy face mask as an adjunct to personal protection equipment to reduce occupational transmission of COVID-19 while performing DFL.
NA,Our modified endoscopy mask provides an additional barrier against the transmission of airborne pathogens.
NA,The modified endoscopy face mask may also serve as a useful tool for otolaryngologists as they return to performing more aerosol-generating procedures in the outpatient setting.
NA,Outbreak of the new type coronavirus infection, known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), has begun in December 2019, in Wuhan, China.
NA,As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2.
NA,There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs.
NA,Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy.
NA,However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections.
NA,Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load.
NA,Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.
NA,In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding.
NA,We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.
NA,It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.
NA,Recently, the World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
NA,So far, however, limited data are available for children.
NA,Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children.
NA,From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected.
NA,The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated.
NA,Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side.
NA,Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type.
NA,Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes.
NA,One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins.
NA,The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various.
NA,Accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT imaging data.
NA,Due to the wide availability, rapid execution, low cost, and possibility of being acquired at the patient's bed, chest X-Ray is a fundamental tool in the diagnosis, follow-up and evaluation of the treatment effectiveness of patients with pneumonia, also in the context of COVID-19 infection.
NA,However, false negative cases are possible.
NA,We report 4 cases of false negative chest X-Rays, in patients who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 by real-time transverse-transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and executed chest unenhanced CTs just after the X-Rays, demonstrating signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the capacities of health systems in many countries.
NA,National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortages of healthcare resources that have to be re-allocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers, and save as many lives as possible.
NA,Also, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions.
NA,In this article, we propose a guidance to the management of pancreatic cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, and based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions.
NA,Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, the authors have separated the prioritisation analyses.
NA,The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale is outlined and discussed.
NA,The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored; it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Pancreatic cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources.
NA,Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.
NA,Three patients of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed the symptoms of olfactory dysfunction.
NA,Clinical characteristics and treatment were retrospective analyzed.
NA,Olfactory disorders are uncommon symptoms of COVID-19 in China.
NA,Early diagnosis and intervention are keys to the recovery of olfactory disorders.
NA,Particular attention should be devoted to olfactory dysfunction.
NA,Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
NA,By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection.
NA,Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact.
NA,Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic.
NA,Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development.
NA,This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.
NA,We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic.
NA,Severe cases infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Feb. 11, 2020, tend to present a hypercatabolic state because of severe systemic consumption, and are susceptible to stress ulcers and even life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding.
NA,Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment constitute an irreplaceable part in the handling of severe COVID-19 cases.
NA,Endoscopes, as reusable precision instruments with complicated structures, require more techniques than other medical devices in cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and other reprocessing procedures.
NA,From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute.
NA,Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses.
NA,In accordance with the national standard &quot;Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016),&quot; we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.
NA,Based on the experience we attained from the 12 severe COVID-19 cases in our hospital who underwent endoscopy 23 times in total, the article provides an improved version of endoscopic reprocessing guidelines for bedside endoscopic diagnosis and treatment on COVID-19 patients for reference.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for COVID-19, can determine cardiac events, which require a quick diagnosis and management, and should not be overlooked due to the presence of COVID-19 infection.
NA,In some cases, cardiovascular symptoms can also be the first and only manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,In patients with COVID-19, the full cardiovascular disease diagnostic algorithm can be hindered by logistic restrain mainly derived from the difficulty of transporting patients in critical conditions to Radiology or Hemodynamics wards.
NA,The echocardiography in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can help for differential diagnosis of cardiac events, which can be related or unrelated by the infection and can likely impact on short-term prognosis.
NA,Indeed, transthoracic echocardiography plays a key role in the screen for CV complications of COVID-19 infection: it must be focused cardiac ultrasound study (FoCUS) performed at bedside.
NA,All transthoracic, transesophageal and stress echocardiograms in patients in which test results are unlikely to change the management strategy should be postponed.
NA,The COVID-19 post-lockdown period and the subsequent progressive withdrawal of the quarantine measures are currently allowing the gradual resumption of the ordinary clinical activities, which have been suppressed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In this phase, it is crucial to minimize the risk of infection to limit COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality and the number of new cases.
NA,Indeed, COVID-19 manifestations may be equivocal, including asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.
NA,In order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare providers, therefore, it is mandatory to stratify the risk of post-COVID-19 pandemic infection during the clinical and instrumental evaluation of cardiac patients, who are at low risk for COVID-19.
NA,Here we discuss the most common diagnostic procedures and therapeutic activities, the type of personal protective equipment according to the different tests, the timetable of the different diagnostic examinations, the tele-health services or alternative strategies, and the structural and management requirements, that should be applied to protect patients and healthcare providers in the post-COVID-19 era.
NA,A mysterious cluster outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019 was traced to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and declared a Pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020.
NA,The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally.
NA,This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons.
NA,These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained.
NA,Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected.
NA,Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance.
NA,All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened.
NA,Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care.
NA,During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld.
NA,All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged.
NA,Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities.
NA,All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19.
NA,There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia.
NA,A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases.
NA,Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020.
NA,Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported.
NA,Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula.
NA,Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV).
NA,The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively.
NA,Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples.
NA,By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log<sub>10</sub> genomic copies/L on average.
NA,Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12).
NA,This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.
NA,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.
NA,At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.
NA,A global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has created unique challenges to providing timely care for cancer patients.
NA,In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6-8 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals.
NA,Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce.
NA,This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer.
NA,This is a single institution retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral medical center examining women who underwent primary hysterectomy or trachelectomy for clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer between 2000 and 2017 (<i>N</i> = 217).
NA,Wait-time from the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer <i>via</i> biopsy to definitive surgery was categorized as: short wait-time (&lt;8 weeks; <i>n</i> = 110) <i>versus</i> long wait-time (≥8 weeks; <i>n</i> = 107).
NA,Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed.
NA,A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed.
NA,In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% <i>versus</i> 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-2.59, <i>P</i> = 0.818) and OS (95.0% <i>versus</i> 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, <i>P</i> = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group.
NA,Three studies were examined for meta-analysis (median, <i>n</i> = 217), and a pooled HR for surgery wait-time of ≥8 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59-1.55).
NA,Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.
NA,Discovered in 2017, swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), also known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) or porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), is the fifth porcine CoV identified in diarrheal piglets.
NA,The presumed name &quot;SADS-CoV&quot; may not be appropriate since current studies have not provided strong evidence for high pathogenicity of the virus.
NA,SeACoV was the most recently recognized CoV of potential bat origin prior to the novel human severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), associated with the pandemic CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Although SeACoV is recognized as a regional epizootic virus currently, it possesses the most extensive cell species tropism in vitro among known CoVs.
NA,This review summarizes the emergence of SeACoV and updates the research progress made from 2017 to early 2020, mainly focusing on the etiology, epidemiology, evolutionary perspective, potential for interspecies transmission, pathogenesis and diagnosis.
NA,A subset of patients with severe COVID-19 develop profound inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction consistent with a &quot;Cytokine Storm Syndrome&quot; (CSS).
NA,In this review we compare the clinical features, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of COVID-CSS with other hematological CSS, namely secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), and CAR-T cell therapy associated Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).
NA,Novel therapeutics targeting cytokines or inhibiting cell signaling pathways have now become the mainstay of treatment in these CSS.
NA,We review the evidence for cytokine blockade and attenuation in these known CSS as well as the emerging literature and clinical trials pertaining to COVID-CSS.
NA,Established markers of inflammation as well as cytokine levels are compared and contrasted between these four entities in order to establish a foundation for future diagnostic criteria of COVID-CSS.
NA,COVID-19 is principally a respiratory illness and pulmonary manifestations constitute main presentations of the disease.
NA,According to the reported studies, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to the respiratory system and other organs can be also affected.
NA,Renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal complications, liver dysfunction, cardiac manifestations, mediastinal findings, neurological abnormalities, and hematological manifestations are among the reported extrapulmonary features.
NA,Considering the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and the increasing worldwide burden of the disease, there is an urgent need to rapidly scale up the diagnostic capacity to detect COVID-19 and its complications.
NA,This paper focuses on the most common extrapulmonary manifestations in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Further studies are needed to elaborate and confirm the causative relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the reported extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.
NA,•COVID-19 is associated with specific skin manifestations and drug eruption.
NA,•This case shows COVID-19-related drug eruption and specific clinical features.
NA,•Drug eruption preceding COVID-19 symptoms may facilitate early diagnosis.
NA,The coronavirus disease of 2019 or COVID-19 was first identified in Hubei Province in China in November of 2019 and quickly spread to become a global pandemic.
NA,The virus, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (2-SARS-CoV-2), is particularly virulent in the elderly who can develop symptoms and become mortally ill within days of contracting the virus.
NA,The virus is easily transmitted by droplets (e.g., sneezing, coughing) and communal living settings such as personal care homes can be vulnerable to the spread of the virus.
NA,Identifying patients early in the disease process is important to providing appropriate medical interventions.
NA,To date, most of the medical literature, including Center for Disease Control guidelines, has relied on three necessary symptoms in making the diagnosis of COVID-19: fever, cough and shortness of breath.
NA,We present four cases of elderly patients who developed altered mental status as their presenting symptom without associated fever or respiratory symptoms.
NA,No studies analyzing the role of dementia as a risk factor for mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.
NA,We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection.
NA,Retrospective study.
NA,COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy.
NA,We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia.
NA,Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed.
NA,Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded.
NA,Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%).
NA,The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p&lt;0.001, Chi-Squared test).
NA,In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p&lt;0.05).
NA,Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status.
NA,The diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients.
NA,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization.
NA,In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients between February 6 and February 14, 2020 with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on pharyngeal swab specimens using real time RT-PCR.
NA,194 (81.5%) of the serums were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%).
NA,There was no difference in the positive rate of antibodies between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85), whose nucleic acid tests were negative.
NA,The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed.
NA,After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped from below 50% to over 80%.
NA,However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased.
NA,Overall, the suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection.
NA,The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy.
NA,After the 11th day post-disease onset, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to manifest with severe acute respiratory syndrome among the adults, however, it offers a convincing indication of less severity and fatality in pediatric age group (0-18 years).
NA,The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
NA,According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22<sup>nd</sup> March (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).
NA,However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available.
NA,Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,On March 29th 2020, 97,689 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed only in Italy, with 73,880 actually positive cases, a daily increase of 3815 cases, 27,386 hospitalized and 3906 patients in intensive care units, causing a total of 10,779 known deaths.
NA,In all urological departments, quickly inpatient and outpatient services have been significantly reduced.
NA,Even in this COVID-19 situation, urological neoplasm care must go on, but significant changes need to be made in the way some care is delivered.
NA,We compared diagnostic and therapeutic elective procedures requested and performed for PC management from our multidisciplinary team (MDT) during 1 month activity in the highest national level of COVID-19 infection (March 2020) and under restrictions for all the population, with the management performed in a no-COVID-19 month (March 2019) 1 year ago.
NA,The only management that did not received a significant reduction are medical therapies for advanced hormone sensitive (HS) or castration resistant (CR) PC.
NA,We describe our MDT identifications of elective undeferrable PC management in this COVID-19 time.
NA,These suggestions have been considered for a country (ITALY) under a rapid increase of COVID-19 cases and complications, but in a region with an actual lower impact (2914 actual positive and 1079 hospitalized cases) from the infection and in an hospital not completely converted to COVID-19 management.
NA,Indications should be different and restricted only to emergencies on the basis of COVID-19 pandemic situation and hospital involvement.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a major surge in needed diagnostic capacity.
NA,In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.
NA,To determine the analytical performance of the ID NOW assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Residual NP samples collected in viral transport media were tested by the ID NOW platform in two independent laboratories.
NA,Results were compared to either the CDC or New York EUA assays, which served as reference methods.
NA,Overall agreement of ID NOW was 78.7%.
NA,Sensitivity was 71.7% and specificity was 100%.
NA,Notably, all false-negative results correlated to those samples that were weakly positive.
NA,ID NOW performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has reduced sensitivity for weakly positive samples.
NA,This sensitivity, among other concerns, should be taken into consideration when using this test for patients with a low suspicion for COVID-19 disease.
NA,To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended.
NA,Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques.
NA,Gynaecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom.
NA,Due to COVID-19 pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom.
NA,In addition there has been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of COVID-19.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> As a result laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration and it is uncertain whether this may impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic presents many unique challenges when caring for patients with pulmonary hypertension.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has altered routine standard of care practice and the acute management particularly for those patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, where pulmonary arterial hypertension-specific treatments are used.
NA,It is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with &quot;exposure risk&quot; to COVID-19 for patients coming to clinic or the hospital.
NA,If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation.
NA,However, the COVID-19 outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work-up including potential exposure to COVID-19 versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high-risk, high likelihood World Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.
NA,This document will highlight some of the issues facing providers, patients, and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in real-time as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and is intended to share expected common clinical scenarios and best clinical practices to help the community at-large.
NA,Italy is the European country that was hit first and hardest by the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,Since February 2020, the outbreak of the epidemic disease in Italy, with fatal outcomes in up to 10% of cases, made it urgent to implement extraordinary measures to avoid a breakdown of the universal Italian national health system.
NA,The update for April 1, 2020, in Italy recorded 102,669 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with a median patient age of 63 years.
NA,The deceased patients were older people (median age 80 years) and often had a cancer diagnosis (about 20%).
NA,Thus, in the extraordinary epidemiological scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, older persons in cancer treatment are at particularly high risk of being severely affected by COVID-19.
NA,These people face a health- and economics-related emergency that also carries cultural and ethical implications.
NA,In accordance with the measures adopted by the Italian government to limit viral transmission, several associations of Italian oncologists have taken action to update Elderly Cancer Care programs.
NA,In view of the newly emerging needs, we herein outline practical suggestions aimed at guaranteeing the best continuity to elderly cancer patients.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disproportionally strained intensive care services worldwide.
NA,Large areas of uncertainly regarding epidemiology, physiology, practice patterns, and resource demands for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 require rapid collection and dissemination of data.
NA,We describe the conception and implementation of an intensive care database rapidly developed and designed to meet data analytic needs in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-the multicenter, international Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study.
NA,Prospective cohort study and disease registry.
NA,Multinational cohort of ICUs.
NA,Critically ill patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,None.
NA,Within 2 weeks of conception of the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study, study leadership was convened, registry case report forms were designed, electronic data entry set up, and more than 250 centers had submitted the protocol for institutional review board approval, with more than 100 cases entered.
NA,The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study provides an example of a rapidly deployed, international, pandemic registry that seeks to provide near real-time analytics and information regarding intensive care treatments and outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,Social distancing as a technique to limit transmission of infectious disease has come into common parlance following the arrival and rapid spread of a novel coronavirus disease around the world in 2019 and 2020.
NA,But in the face of an emerging pandemic threat, it is crucial that we start to apply these principles to the clinic, the emergency department, and the hospital ward.
NA,We propose that this dynamic situation calls for a parallel &quot;Clinical Distancing&quot; in which we as a medical culture go against many of our fundamental instincts and, at least in the short term, begin to reduce unnecessary patient-care contacts for the benefit of our patients and our ability to continue to provide care to those who need it most.
NA,In this commentary, we provide specific recommendations for the rapid implementation of clinical distancing techniques.
NA,<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> The aim of this study was to provide recommendations for improving the design of subsequent studies through analysis of the registered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical trials.<b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> A retrospective analysis of 189 trials retrievals achieved on February 20, 2020.<b> <i>Results:</i> </b> A total of 189 trials are included in the study.
NA,There were 69.3% interventional studies, 21.7% observational studies, 5.3% diagnostic tests, and 3.7% other studies.
NA,The following statistics are provided only for the interventional studies.
NA,Severity of disease: 5.3% light and common type, 17.6% severe and critically ill, and 59.6% with no restricted classification.
NA,Medication use: 51.1% Western medicine, 32.1% Chinese medicine, 10.7% blood related product, and 6.1% non-drug therapy.
NA,The median and inner quantile range of the sample sizes included in these studies: 104 (IQR: 60, 200).
NA,Primary outcome type most used: 45.8% with clinical characteristics and 21.4% with virological.
NA,Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter, and 76% of all studies were single-center.<b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy.
NA,Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.
NA,One of the many questions with respect to controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic is whether existing drugs can be re-purposed (re-positioned) for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19 - or for any future epidemic.
NA,The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials.
NA,These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure.
NA,Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment.
NA,The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs.
NA,These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests).
NA,Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe).
NA,By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression.
NA,These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19.
NA,Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.
NA,The current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents psychosomatic clinics with new challenges.
NA,In order that psychotherapists in private practice can also obtain a picture for their patients, this article deals with the core aspects of hygiene.
NA,There are three fundamental patterns of care and provisions by the institutions that can be differentiated: rededication, stepwise evacuation and stand-by for rededication and continuation of the service under medical epidemic conditions.
NA,The following topics are the relevant contents: need for consultation in the matter of anxiety for coronavirus and interpersonal mental and psychosomatic problems due to the necessary social distancing, care especially in precarious living situations, altered communication structures (telephone, video consultation) and care of those occupied with the topic of &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19).
NA,All patients undergo a clinical and virologic diagnostic process before admittance and receive psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care, possibly beginning under quarantine conditions.
NA,Furthermore, appropriate general hygiene regulations are explained.
NA,Finally, what the patients are told is illustrated using a simple schematic aid: distance (minimum 2 m), rubbing (wash hands with soap often and for at least 20 s), avoidance (pass by in a friendly manner), alternative communication, forsaking (shopping is not always necessary), wiping (regularly wipeing of all surfaces by the cleaning personnel as well as tablet and mobile telephone by the patients themselves) and outside activity as much as possible, alone or sitting together (with safety distance).
NA,The psychosomatic services were appropriately converted.
NA,Coronavirus is normally transmitted from animal to person, but nowadays it is transmitted from person to person by changing its form.
NA,Covid-19 appeared as a very dangerous virus and unfortunately caused a worldwide pandemic disease.
NA,Radiology doctors use X-ray or CT images for the diagnosis of Covid-19.
NA,It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods.
NA,Therefore, we proposed a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus.
NA,The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection stages.
NA,Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase.
NA,The proposed feature generation method is called as Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP).
NA,In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used.
NA,Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN) and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase.
NA,Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation are used for training and testing.
NA,In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation.
NA,This result clearly has shown that we reached the perfect classification rate by using X-ray image for Covid-19 detection.
NA,Accumulating data have now shown strong evidence that COVID-19 infection leads to the occurrence of neurological signs with different injury severity.
NA,Anosmia and agueusia are now well documented and included in the criteria list for diagnosis, and specialists have stressed that doctors screen COVID-19 patients for these two signs.
NA,The eventual brainstem dysregulation, due to the invasion of SARS CoV-2, as a cause of respiratory problems linked to COVID-19, has also been extensively discussed.
NA,All these findings lead to an implication of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
NA,Here we provide additional elements that could explain other described signs like appetite loss, vomiting, and nausea.
NA,For this, we investigated the role of brainstem structures located in the medulla oblongata involved in food intake and vomiting control.
NA,We also discussed the possible pathways the virus uses to reach the brainstem, i.e., neurotropic and hematogenous (with its two variants) routes.
NA,The successful sequencing of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid paved the way for exploration of omics systems science and integrative biology research approaches for combating this unprecedented planetary health challenge.
NA,Omics-scale studies on this viral infection are emerging rapidly and offer a tremendous potential to unravel the puzzles of the SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, and ways forward for diagnostic and therapeutic innovation.
NA,The first Hungarian COVID-19 case was reported on March 4, 2020 by Hungarian officials.
NA,Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with 12% of total coronavirus cases confirmed among them recently. 80% of the infected persons show only mild, moderate symptoms or stay asymptomatic.
NA,The single-stranded viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR from the respiratory tract, urine, blood and, particulary in children, from stool samples for 30-40 days.
NA,We have no valid data of how many HCWs have been infected since the Hungarian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, due to the lack of the systematic screening.
NA,HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members.
NA,Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., &quot;already protected&quot;, the ones in the acute phase, i.e., &quot;the infectious&quot;, and the virus-naive, i.e., &quot;at risk&quot; workers.
NA,Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

NA,For diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is routinely used.
NA,However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19.
NA,Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease.
NA,In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19.
NA,Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist.
NA,The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative.
NA,When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel beta-coronavirus that has recently emerged as the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
NA,Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests are optimal and recommended for the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to diagnose previous exposure to the virus.
NA,Here we evaluate the analytical performance parameters of the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology assays and describe the kinetics of IgM and IgG seroconversion observed in patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital.
NA,We validated the performance of the Diazyme assay in 235 subjects to determine specificity.
NA,Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes.
NA,Sensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at ≥ 15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG.
NA,The median time to seropositivity observed for a reactive IgM and IgG result from the date of a positive PCR was 5 days (IQR: 2.75-9 days) and 4 days (IQR: 2.75-6.75 days), respectively.
NA,Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme IgM/IgG assays are suited for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,For the first time, we report longitudinal data showing the evolution of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM in a cohort of acutely ill patients in the United States.
NA,We also demonstrate a low false positive rate in patients who were presumed to be disease free.
NA,The diagnosis and management of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) in the context COVID-19 poses a challenge for clinicians.
NA,We present a case illustrating this due to the masking of the typical laboratory pattern of APML coagulopathy and the potential heightened risks of thrombosis and differentiation syndrome (DS) when the two conditions are combined.
NA,Up to February 24<sup>th</sup> 2020 occasionally occuring SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany without severe course.
NA,Emergency presentation of a couple in the emergency room.
NA,For seven days now, the man has fever, dry cough und physical weakness and the wife has similar symptoms of a milder form.
NA,The clinical examination shows fine crackles over both lungs and a respiratory failure of the husband.
NA,Laboratory increase in inflammation parameters as well as transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase.
NA,Radiologically lung infiltrates of different severity.
NA,Further on diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2-infection of both patients with a severe course of the male.
NA,Intubation and mechanical ventilation of the male patient with prolonged intenive care treatment.
NA,Recovery of the female patient under conventional oxygen therapy.
NA,These two cases show the starting point of an endemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the district of Heinsberg (North Rhine-Westphalia) and up to this point the first case of a life-threatenning course in Germany.
NA,Bis zum 24.02.2020 vereinzelt auftretende, nicht schwerverlaufende SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen in Deutschland.
NA,Notfallmäßige Vorstellung eines Ehepaars in der zentralen Notaufnahme.
NA,Der Mann gibt an, seit 7 Tagen an hochfieberhaften Temperaturen, trockenem Reizhusten und körperlicher Schwäche zu leiden, während die Ehefrau ähnliche Symptome in milderer Ausprägung bietet.
NA,In der klinischen Untersuchung fallen feinblasige Rasselgeräusche über beiden Lungen beider Patienten und eine respiratorische Insuffizienz des Ehemanns auf.
NA,Laborserologisch Erhöhung der Inflammationsparameter sowie der Transaminasen und der Laktatdehydrogenase.
NA,Röntgenologisch pulmonale Infiltrate unterschiedlicher Ausprägung bei beiden Patienten.
NA,Im weiteren Verlauf Nachweis einer SARS-CoV-2-Infektion der Ehepartner mit schwerem Verlauf beim männlichen Patienten.
NA,Intubation und Beatmung des männlichen Patienten bei mittelschwerem ARDS mit langer intensivmedizinischer Behandlung.
NA,Genesung der weiblichen Patientin unter Sauerstofftherapie.
NA,Diese beiden Fälle zeigen den Ausgangspunkt einer endemischen Verbreitung von SARS-CoV-2 im Landkreis Heinsberg (NRW) und bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt den ersten Fall eines lebensbedrohlichen Verlaufs in Deutschland.
NA,In this report, updated information and future perspectives about the use of saliva as a sample for laboratory analysis of the Covid-19 are highlighted.
NA,Saliva can be used for the direct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the quantification of the specific immunoglobulins produced against it, and for the evaluation of the non-specific, innate immune response of the patient.
NA,Moreover, a deeper knowledge of potential changes in the saliva proteome in this disease may allow the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, or even help our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the disease.
NA,With the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays, saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis, disease management, and control of Covid-19.
NA,When preparing for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) questions arose regarding various aspects concerning the anaesthetist.
NA,When reviewing the literature it became obvious that keeping up-to-date with all relevant publications is almost impossible.
NA,We searched for and summarised clinically relevant topics that could help making clinical decisions.
NA,This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
NA,With ongoing treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients other questions will come up.
NA,While respective guidelines on these topics will serve clinicians in clinical practice, regularly updating all guidelines concerning COVID-19 will be a necessary, although challenging task in the upcoming weeks and months.
NA,All recommendations during the current extremely rapid development of knowledge must be evaluated on a daily basis, as suggestions made today may be out-dated with the new evidence available tomorrow.
NA,Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a prerequisite for treatment and prevention.
NA,The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of the antibody test to RNA test need to be demonstrated.
NA,Serial sera of 80 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.
NA,Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described.
NA,The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively.
NA,The first detectible serology marker was Ab, followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 days post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset (d.p.o), respectively.
NA,The antibody levels increased rapidly beginning at 6 d.p.o. and were accompanied by a decline in viral load.
NA,For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7 d.p.o), Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p&lt;0.001).
NA,The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% 2 weeks later, respectively.
NA,When the same antibody type was detected, no significant difference was observed between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other forms of immunoassays.
NA,A typical acute antibody response is induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of illness for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patients.
NA,Since late December 2019, the world has been challenged with an outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,In Thailand, an upper middle-income country with a limited healthcare infrastructure and restricted human resources, nearly 3,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported as of early May 2020.
NA,Public health policies aimed at preventing new COVID-19 cases were very effective in halting the pandemic in Thailand.
NA,Case fatality in Thailand has been low (1.7%), at least in part due to early stratification according to risk of disease severity and timely initiation of supportive care with affordable measures.
NA,We present our initial experience with COVID-19 in Thailand, focusing on several aspects that may have played a crucial role in curtailment of the pandemic, and elements of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients, including stratification, isolation, and affordable diagnostic approaches and supportive care measures.
NA,We also discuss local considerations concerning some proposed experimental treatments.
NA,Nationwide shortages of tests that detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to significantly relax regulations regarding COVID-19 diagnostic testing.
NA,To date the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to 48 COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and 21 high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests, as well as implemented policies that give broad authority to clinical laboratories and commercial manufacturers in the development, distribution, and use of COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
NA,Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests.
NA,Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen.
NA,Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system.
NA,A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection.
NA,In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.
NA,The current global pandemic of COVID-19 due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is causing considerable loss of life and enormous social and economic disruption.
NA,Here, we describe the response of the blood service, the impact on blood donation and the effects on the blood supply in Hong Kong posed by the earlier SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003.
NA,The infection, like SARS-CoV-2 was highly contagious through droplet transmission.
NA,In the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, donor and staff safety was secured by using stringent infection control measures to protect both donors and staff from contacting the virus.
NA,All the donors were requested to wear face masks within the donation venue and use an alcohol-based hand rinse.
NA,The donors' body temperature was checked before donation and staff's body temperatures were checked daily.
NA,The safety of the blood supply was secured by a donor deferral policy for 4 weeks following contact with a confirmed or suspected case of and a post-donation call-back system.
NA,Despite scheduling mobile donation sessions and a decrease in donors attending blood donor centers, the blood supply was maintained as there was a 12.8% reduction of the demand of blood and only a 16.9% reduction in the blood donation.
NA,Lessons learnt during the epidemic may help preparation for future epidemics and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis and role of coronaviruses in transfusion medicine.
NA,These are continuing problems as coronavirus epidemics may recur with future impact on blood collection and blood donation screening.

NA,With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the current worldwide pandemic, there is mounting evidence that patients affected by the illness may develop clinically significant coagulopathy with thromboembolic complications including ischemic stroke.
NA,However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.
NA,We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic.
NA,We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls).
NA,In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls).
NA,During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke.
NA,Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, <i>P</i>=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
NA,When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels.
NA,When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.
NA,We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
NA,Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased.
NA,Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.
NA,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) created an exceptional situation in which numerous laboratories in Europe simultaneously implemented SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.
NA,These laboratories reported in February 2020 that commercial primer and probe batches for SARS-CoV-2 detection were contaminated with synthetic control material, causing delays of regional testing roll-out in various countries.
NA,We present a highly suspicious case of COVID-19 infection, incidentally found on F-FDG PET/CT images.
NA,Patient was scanned on February, 25, 2020, when COVID-19 outbreak was unrecognized in our country.
NA,She admitted having recent occasional dry cough and fever.
NA,A retrospective review of her clinical and laboratory data was strongly suggestive for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
NA,PET/CT images demonstrated hypermetabolic diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs with bilateral nodules.
NA,There was no evidence of pleural effusion or prominent mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
NA,Radiologists must be aware of COVID-19 presentations on PET/CT scan images during COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Approximately 3 billion people around the world have gone into some form of social separation to mitigate the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,The uncontrolled influx of patients in need of emergency care has rapidly brought several national health systems to near-collapse with deadly consequences to those afflicted by COVID-19 and other critical diseases associated with COVID-19.
NA,Solid scientific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 remains scarce; there is an urgent need to expand our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology to facilitate precise and targeted treatments.
NA,The capacity for rapid information dissemination has emerged as a double-edged sword; the existing gap of high-quality data is frequently filled by anecdotal reports, contradictory statements and misinformation.
NA,This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity.
NA,Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
NA,The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
NA,Furthermore, solutions for enhancing international strategies in translational research, cooperative networks and regulatory partnerships are contemplated.
NA,Healthcare systems are belligerently responding to the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS co-V2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (&gt;50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance.
NA,When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation the outcome is poor and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually two or three weeks.
NA,In this manuscript, authors will review several technological devices, which could support healthcare providers at the bedside to optimise the care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralysed and ventilated.
NA,Particular attention is provided to the use of video-laryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anaesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting healthcare providers from this viral infection.
NA,Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train of four monitors which are utilised to better titrate neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources.
NA,COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU.
NA,This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation.
NA,The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care.
NA,The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics.
NA,Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount.
NA,Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.
NA,In order to benefit the public, community workers and scientific community, we hereby present a chronicle of SARS-CoV-2 that leads to the unseen precedent of social distancing and lockdown owing to coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic.
NA,Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
NA,We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses.
NA,The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management.
NA,We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.
NA,We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.
NA,The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical features and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and to compare the characteristics of patients diagnosed in Wuhan and in other areas of China by integrating the findings reported in previous studies.
NA,We conducted a proportion meta-analysis to integrate the results of previous studies identified in online databases, and subsequently compared the overlapping of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between locations of diagnosis.
NA,The heterogeneity of the results of the included studies was also demonstrated.
NA,Nine studies with level IV evidence were considered to be eligible for the meta-analysis, and a comparative analysis was only possible between patients diagnosed in Wuhan and outside of Wuhan in China.
NA,Fever (84.8%; 95% CI, 78.5% to 90.1%) was identified as the most common clinical manifestation in all COVID-19 patients, and signs of respiratory infection were also frequently present in these patients.
NA,When comparing the clinical features according to the location of diagnosis, fever and dyspnea were less frequent in patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan (fever: 78.1%; 95% CI, 73.2% to 82.7%; dyspnea: 3.80%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 12.22%) than in patients diagnosed in Wuhan (fever: 91.7%; 95% CI, 88.0% to 94.8%; dyspnea: 21.1%; 95% CI, 13.2% to 30.3%).
NA,The chest CT findings exhibited no significant differences between the groups.
NA,Fever was found to be the most common symptom in COVID-19, and respiratory infection signs were also commonly present.
NA,Fever and dyspnea were less frequently observed in the patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan, which should be considered in COVID-19 screening programs.
NA,These results may be attributable to the earlier diagnosis of the disease and the younger age of patients outside of Wuhan although further analysis is needed.
NA,The role of chest CT in COVID-19 diagnosis is inconclusive based on this study.
NA,Diagnostic approaches to COVID-19 include clinical history, PCR tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and detection of antibodies.
NA,By combining these three approaches, the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be examined in healthcare teams.
NA,The aim of the study was to examine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population of healthcare professionals 6 - 8 weeks after the first COVID-19 case was detected in the Czech Republic.
NA,A total of 269 subjects were enrolled in the study (187 women, 82 men) with a median age of 45.9 years (21 - 71 years).
NA,We used a questionnaire to ascertain travel history and clinical signs of any respiratory tract infection.
NA,Blood samples were collected, and IgG levels were analysed in all samples.
NA,The level of IgA antibodies was analysed in those positive for IgG.
NA,PCR testing was performed in cases testing positive for presence of antibodies.
NA,The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 from Euroimmun (Germany) was used to analyse immunoglobulin levels. 17 % of the tested cohort reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 35.8 % reported history of international travel.
NA,There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85 %), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37 %).
NA,There was only one PCR positive subject.
NA,Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals.
NA,This article shows the pitfalls of the testing methods and highlights the necessity of using a correct testing algorithm, considering the character of the tested population and the expected low prevalence.
NA,To study the clinical and epidemiological features of children with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
NA,The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed.
NA,Among the 20 children, there were 7 boys (35%) and 13 girls (65%), aged 8 months to 14 years (mean 8±5 years).
NA,All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Nineteen children were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in all 20 children.
NA,There were 4 children (20%) of mild type, 16 children (80%) of common type, and no children of severe type or critical type.
NA,The mean peripheral blood leukocyte count was (6.8±3.5)×10<sup>9</sup>/L, and 7 children had an abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count, with an increase in 5 children and a reduction in 2 children.
NA,One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×10<sup>9</sup>/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (&gt;400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (&gt;1.6 mmol/L).
NA,Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children.
NA,Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation.
NA,Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests.
NA,Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.
NA,To study the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged &lt;18 years.
NA,A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020.
NA,Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation.
NA,Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type.
NA,Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs.
NA,The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days).
NA,Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer.
NA,Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
NA,All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered.
NA,COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results.
NA,Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.
NA,Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years.
NA,This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of two children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hypertension.
NA,Case 1 was a boy aged 13 years and 3 months, with the main manifestations of fever and dry cough; chest CT showed ground-glass opacities, and the nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) yielded a positive result.
NA,Case 2 was a boy aged 13 years and 8 months and had no clinical symptoms; chest CT showed no abnormality, while the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 yielded a positive result.
NA,Both cases were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,They had obesity and a family history of hypertension.
NA,Continuous blood pressure monitoring in the resting state during hospitalization showed that blood pressure was above the 95% reference interval of normal value for children of the same age, and the two boys were given calcium channel blockers or β-receptor blockers and were then recovered.
NA,It is concluded that comprehensive management of children with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, should be taken seriously during the epidemic.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent and unprecedented need for rapid large-scale diagnostic testing to inform timely patient management.
NA,However, robust data are lacking on the relative performance of available rapid molecular tests across a full range of viral concentrations.
NA,This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations.
NA,A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay.
NA,Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert.
NA,Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively.
NA,Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value &lt;30).
NA,However, for Ct values &gt;30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert.
NA,While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations.
NA,Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of ID Now for direct swabs.
NA,COVID-19 infections are characterized by inflammation of the lungs and other organs that ranges from mild and asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal.
NA,Patients who are immunocompromised and those with cardiopulmonary comorbidities appear to be particularly afflicted by this illness.
NA,During pandemic conditions, many aspects of cancer care have been impacted.
NA,One important clinical question is how to manage patients who need anticancer therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during these conditions.
NA,Herein, we consider diagnostic and therapeutic implications of using ICI during this unprecedented period of COVID-19 infections.
NA,In particular, we consider the impact of ICI on COVID-19 severity, decisions surrounding continuing or interrupting therapy, diagnostic measures in patients with symptoms or manifestations potentially consistent with either COVID-19 or ICI toxicity, and resumption of therapy in infected patients.
NA,While more robust data are needed to guide clinicians on management of patients with cancer who may be affected by COVID-19, we hope this commentary provides useful insights for the clinical community.
NA,Currently, there are four seasonal coronaviruses associated with relatively mild respiratory tract disease in humans.
NA,However, there are also a plethora of animal coronaviruses, which have the potential to cross the species border.
NA,This regularly results in the emergence of new viruses in humans.
NA,In 2002 SARS-CoV emerged, to rapidly disappear in May 2003.
NA,In 2012 MERS-CoV was identified as a possible threat to humans, but its pandemic potential so far is minimal, as the human-to-human transmission is ineffective.
NA,The end of 2019 brought us information about the SARS-CoV-2 emergence, and the virus rapidly spread in 2020 causing an unprecedented pandemic.At present, the studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line.
NA,This model is convenient for diagnostics, but it has serious limitations and does not allow for the understanding of virus biology and evolution.Here we show that fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures constitute an excellent model to study the infection with the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We observed an efficient replication of the virus in the tissue, with the maximal replication at 2 days post-infection.
NA,The virus replicated in ciliated cells and was released apically.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020.
NA,At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds.
NA,While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells.
NA,Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Guideline: Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease during the covid-19 pandemicPublished by the European Society of Cardiology.This summary is based on the version published on 21 April 2020 (https://www.escardio.org/Education/COVID-19-and-Cardiology/ESC-COVID-19-Guidance).
NA,The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the need to move from traditional lab-centralized diagnostics to point-of-care (PoC) settings.
NA,Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms facilitate the translation to PoC settings via the miniaturization, portability, integration, and automation of multiple assay functions onto a single chip.
NA,For this purpose, paper-based assays and microfluidic platforms are currently being extensively studied, and much focus is being directed towards simplifying their design while simultaneously improving multiplexing and automation capabilities.
NA,Signal amplification strategies are being applied to improve the performance of assays with respect to both sensitivity and selectivity, while smartphones are being integrated to expand the analytical power of the technology and promote its accessibility.
NA,In this chapter, we review the main technologies in the field of LoC platforms for PoC medical diagnostics and survey recent approaches for improving these assays.
NA,To retrospectively analyze the chest computed tomography (CT) features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.
NA,From January 9, 2020, to February 26, 2020, totally 56 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT.
NA,For 40 patients, follow-up CT scans were obtained.
NA,The CT images were evaluated for the number, type and distribution of the opacity, and the affected lung lobes.
NA,Furthermore, the initial CT scan and the follow-up CT scans were compared.
NA,Forty patients (83.6%) had two or more opacities in the lung.
NA,Eighteen (32.7%) patients had only ground-glass opacities; twenty-nine patients (52.7%) had ground-glass and consolidative opacities; and eight patients (14.5%) had only consolidation.
NA,A total of 43 patients (78.2%) showed two or more lobes involved.
NA,The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%).
NA,Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved.
NA,The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with &quot;white lungs.&quot; The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance.
NA,The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved.
NA,Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption).
NA,• The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected.
NA,• CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression.
NA,• CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.
NA,The pandemic of new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has stressed the importance of effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of clinical worsening and mortality.
NA,Epidemiological data showing a differential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on women and men has suggested a potential role for testosterone (T) in determining gender-disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes.
NA,To estimate the association between T level and SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes (defined as conditions requiring transfer to higher or lower intensity of care or death) in a cohort of patients admitted in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 31 male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and recovered in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the &quot;Carlo Poma&quot; Hospital in Mantua were analyzed.
NA,Several biochemical risk factors (i.e., blood count and leucocyte formula, C- Reactive Protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), Lactic Dehydrogenase (LDH), Ferritin, D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, Interleukin 6 (IL-6)) as well as total testosterone (TT), calculated free T (cFT), Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) were determined.
NA,Lower TT and cFT were found in the transferred to ICU/deceased in RICU group vs. groups of patients transferred to IM or maintained in the RICU in stable condition.
NA,Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (i.e. the neutrophil count, LDH and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count.
NA,Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels.
NA,A steep increase of both ICU transfer or mortality risk was observed in men with TT&lt;5 nmol/L or cFT&lt; 100 pmol/L.
NA,Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected men admitted to RICU.
NA,Based on observations described in our letter, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) anosmia must imperatively be added to the list of specific symptoms of COVID-19 infection, (2) anosmia can serve as a free and specific diagnostic tool for developing countries currently affected by the pandemic, (3) the mechanisms of COVID-19 anosmia seem not to directly involve nasal obstruction but rather seem to be related to damage the olfactory neuroepithelium.
NA,The results of research on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical imaging of the lungs of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been published in various forms.
NA,In this study, we reviewed the AI for diagnostic imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,PubMed, arXiv, medRxiv, and Google scholar were used to search for AI studies.
NA,There were 15 studies of COVID-19 that used AI for medical imaging.
NA,Of these, 11 studies used AI for computed tomography (CT) and 4 used AI for chest radiography.
NA,Eight studies presented independent test data, 5 used disclosed data, and 4 disclosed the AI source codes.
NA,The number of datasets ranged from 106 to 5941, with sensitivities ranging from 0.67-1.00 and specificities ranging from 0.81-1.00 for prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Four studies with independent test datasets showed a breakdown of the data ratio and reported prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC).
NA,These 4 studies showed very high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, in the range of 0.9-0.98, 0.91-0.96, and 0.96-0.99, respectively.
NA,COVID-19 is highly contagious and has a variety of clinical manifestations, it can affect a number of other organs in addition to the lungs, and liver injury may occur.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 can cause liver injury through systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), cytokine storms, ischemia-reperfusion injury, side effects of treatment drugs, and underlying liver disease and can attack liver cells directly via ACE2.
NA,Clinical studies have found that liver injury in COVID-19 patients mainly manifests as abnormal liver biochemical indicators, but there have been no reports of liver failure caused by this disease.
NA,The number of COVID-19 patients with liver injury is increasing, and the incidence of liver injury in COVID-19 patients with severe disease are higher than in patients with mild disease.
NA,Liver injury may be a risk factor for progresses and worsens in patients with COVID-19, and it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of liver injury in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

NA,The current outbreak of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands its rapid, convenient, and large-scale diagnosis to downregulate its spread within as well as across the communities.
NA,But the reliability, reproducibility, and selectivity of majority of such diagnostic tests fail when they are tested either to a viral load at its early representation or to a viral gene mutated during its current spread.
NA,In this regard, a selective &quot;naked-eye&quot; detection of SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable, which can be tested without accessing any advanced instrumental techniques.
NA,We herein report the development of a colorimetric assay based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), when capped with suitably designed thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific for N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, could be used for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within 10 min from the isolated RNA samples.
NA,The thiol-modified ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance.
NA,Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA-DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs.
NA,The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/μL of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load.
NA,Thus, the current study reports a selective and visual &quot;naked-eye&quot; detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, without the requirement of any sophisticated instrumental techniques.
NA,On February 27, 2020, the first patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Netherlands.
NA,During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring.
NA,To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms.
NA,This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,Data analysis was performed in March 2020.
NA,The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples.
NA,Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested.
NA,Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed.
NA,Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever.
NA,Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath.
NA,Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms.
NA,Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread.
NA,The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.
NA,The current COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge to every health system over the globe.
NA,Unfortunately, it is likely that this emergency will not disappear soon.
NA,No health system, with its present resources and work flow is ready to deal with a full-blown wave of this pandemic.
NA,Rapid acquisition of specific new skills may be fundamental in delivering appropriate health care for our patients.
NA,COVID-19 infection is classically diagnosed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and radiological investigations (X-ray or high-resolution computerized tomography).
NA,These techniques are not without limitations.
NA,Ultrasound has been suggested as a reliable and accurate tool for assessing the lungs in patients with suspected pneumonia.
NA,Obstetricians and gynecologists are usually familiar with the use of ultrasound.
NA,Lung ultrasound can show specific signs of interstitial pneumonia, which is characteristic of COVID-19 pulmonary infection.
NA,We believe that extensive and rapid training of healthcare providers on the application of ultrasound in the detection of characteristic pulmonary signs of COVID-19 infection, in addition to proper care and handling of their ultrasound machines, is feasible and may be critical in order to provide appropriate management especially of the obstetric patient in the coming period.
NA,We present a systematic approach to lung examination, simplified to encourage its adoption by obstetricians and gynecologists, together with an example of a recent pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection, in which lung ultrasound was useful in the management.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is pressuring healthcare systems worldwide.
NA,Disease outcomes in certain subgroups of patients are still scarce, and data are needed.
NA,Therefore, we describe here the experience of four dialysis centers of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force.
NA,During March 2020, within an overall population of 643 hemodialysis patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity was detected in 94 (15%).
NA,At disease diagnosis, 37 of the 94 (39%) patients (group 1) were managed on an outpatient basis, whereas the remaining 57 (61%) (group 2) required hospitalization.
NA,Choices regarding management strategy were made based on disease severity.
NA,In group 1, 41% received antivirals and 76% hydroxychloroquine.
NA,Eight percent died and 5% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,In group 2, 79% received antivirals and 77% hydroxychloroquine.
NA,Forty two percent died and 79% developed ARDS.
NA,Overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was 29%.
NA,History of ischemic cardiac disease, fever, older age (over age 70), and dyspnea at presentation were associated with the risk of developing ARDS, whereas fever, cough and a C-reactive protein higher than 50 mg/l at disease presentation were associated with the risk of death.
NA,Thus, in our population of hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we documented a wide range of disease severity.
NA,The risk of ARDS and death is significant for patients requiring hospital admission at disease diagnosis.
NA,To report a clinical case of a patient with a compatible HRCT scan and two negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA upper respiratory tract specimens but with a confirmed viral infection by BAL (19 days after symptom onset).
NA,Revision of a patient's clinical charts with COVID-19 admitted at INMI L.
NA,Spallanzani Hospital RESULTS: Two oropharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were performed at admission (17 days from symptoms onset) and a day apart and were found negative.
NA,BAL fluid collected 19 days after symptoms onset was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This case highlights importance of clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in diagnosis and infectivity assessment.
NA,We suggest collection of BAL fluid when consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs are negative, to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
NA,Healthcare workers should perform aerosol-generating procedures in an adequately ventilated room and should wear adequate PPE.
NA,Cutaneous manifestation is a newly reported clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection.
NA,The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described.
NA,Our patient, a medical person, had viral exanthem distributed in the extremities along with a &quot;Spins and needles sensation,&quot; which differs from a previously published paper on cutaneous manifestations.
NA,The differential diagnosis of drug-induced skin rash and hand-foot-mouth disease was ruled out based on the patient's previous history and course of the disease.
NA,COVID-19 mortality disproportionally affects nursing homes, creating enormous pressures to deliver high-quality end-of-life care.
NA,Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans.
NA,Therefore, we aimed to identify, review and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations.
NA,We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world.
NA,Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against pre-specified eligibility criteria.
NA,We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques.
NA,We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care; from the World Health Organization (n=3), and eight individual countries: USA (n=7), the Netherlands (n=2), Ireland (n=1), United Kingdom (n=3), Switzerland (n=3), New Zealand (n=1), Belgium (n=1).
NA,International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care related topics.
NA,Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision-making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers).
NA,There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes.
NA,Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made.
NA,Key aspects of palliative care, i.e. symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.
NA,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemic prevention strategies have been implemented worldwide.
NA,For the sake of controlling the infectious coronavirus pneumonia, early diagnosis and quarantine play an imperative role.
NA,Currently, the mainstream diagnostic methods are imaging and laboratory diagnosis, which differ in their efficacy of diagnosis.
NA,To compare the detection rate, we reviewed numerous literature on pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and analyzed two different ways of diagnosis.
NA,The results showed that the detection rate of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis was significantly higher than that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (P = 0.00697).
NA,Still, clinicians should combine radiology and laboratory methods to achieve a higher detection rate, so that instant isolation and treatment could be effectively conducted to curb the rampant spread of the epidemic.
NA,This manuscript provides guidance on the management of thyroid dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Auto-immune thyroid diseases are not linked to increased risks of COVID-19.
NA,Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis may result in more severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including thyroid storm.
NA,The management of patients with a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is best undertaken with a block and replace regimen due to limited biochemical testing availability.
NA,Antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced neutropenia may favour the progression of COVID-19 and symptoms of infection may be confused with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The withdrawal of ATDs and urgent measurement of neutrophils should be considered in case of flu-like manifestations occurring in the initial months of treatment.
NA,Urgent surgery or 131-I may be undertaken in selected cases of uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves' ophthalmopathy.
NA,Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication.
NA,The usual advice to increase dosage of levothyroxine during pregnancy should be adhered to.
NA,Many newly presenting and previously diagnosed patients with thyroid dysfunction can be managed through virtual telephone or video clinics supported by a dedicated nurse-led service, depending on available facilities.
NA,Most patients with thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer (TC) referred for diagnostic work-up and treatment are not considered at higher risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population.
NA,On the other hand, healthcare resources should be spared to the maximum extent possible during a pandemic.
NA,Indeed, while thyroid nodules are very common, only a small percentage are cancerous and, in turn, most thyroid cancers are indolent in nature.
NA,Accordingly, diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules, thyroid surgery for either benign or malignant thyroid nodules and radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers may be safely postponed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,Appropriate patient counselling, however, is mandatory and red flags should be carefully identified prompting immediate evaluation and treatment as appropriate.
NA,For these selected cases diagnostic work-up (e.g. ultrasound, scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration), surgery and radioiodine therapy may proceed despite the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, after an individual risk-benefit analysis.
NA,There were some family infections of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Taiwan to date.
NA,This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of different types of family infections with COVID-19 and to share Taiwan's experience.
NA,We collected cases of family infections of COVID-19 from 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020.
NA,The data were collected from a series of press conference contents by Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).
NA,During this period, there were six family infections in Taiwan, including two couple infections, one imported family cluster infection, and three domestic family cluster infections.
NA,Compared to the former two, the starters (cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed longer symptom-onset to diagnosis (<i>p</i> = 0.02); longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation (<i>p</i> = 0.01); higher first-generation reproduction number (<i>p</i> = 0.03); and more critical presentation (endotracheal tube insertion and intensive care unit (ICU) care) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).
NA,In addition, compared to the former two, the starters of the latter were older, had no history of travel, and had more underlying diseases and more mortality.
NA,There are more contacts of domestic family cluster infections, making epidemiological investigations more difficult and expensive.
NA,However, the second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero.
NA,Domestic family cluster infections of COVID-19 have different characteristics and outcomes from couple infection and imported family cluster infections in this study.
NA,The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 made imperative the need for diagnostic tests that can identify the infection.
NA,Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful.
NA,However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed.
NA,We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv.
NA,We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities.
NA,We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA).
NA,We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals.
NA,Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests.
NA,IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms.
NA,Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone.
NA,All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%.
NA,ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%.
NA,ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic.
NA,LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.
NA,Quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, early treat, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria.
NA,To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR.
NA,We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from 77 clinical throat swabs, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey.
NA,According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR reports were detected as positive by ddPCR.
NA,The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively.
NA,Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR, which still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 5-12 days post discharge.
NA,Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.
NA,The recent outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, PR China, was caused by a novel beta coronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,To summarize chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the early stage of COVID-19 infection and provide a piece of reliable imaging evidence for initial screening and diagnosis.
NA,From 10 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, we continuously observed chest CT imaging of 14 patients with clinically suspected new coronavirus infection in the two weeks after onset of symptoms.
NA,Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, reticular pattern, and ground-glass mimic nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded.
NA,We enrolled 14 patients, of which nine patients had the infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,Five patients were highly suspected of infection.
NA,All cases had epidemiological evidence.
NA,GGO was a dominant imaging manifestation in the initial days of infection.
NA,GGO performance accounts for 40% in 1- 2 days, 90% in 3- 6 days, and 85% in 7- 10 days.
NA,With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT.
NA,Consolidation performance accounts for 0% in 1- 2 days, 40% in 3- 6 days, and 71% in 7- 10 days.
NA,The lesions are mostly near the pleura.
NA,The number of lesions and the extent of the lesions increased as the disease progressed.
NA,Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia have characteristic CT features in the initial stage of infection, which can be used as an essential supplement for nucleic acid examination.
NA,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 10 May 2020: notifications = 6,971; deaths = 98.
NA,The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March.
NA,The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community.
NA,Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate.
NA,Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive.
NA,These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings.
NA,In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel.
NA,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster.
NA,Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease.
NA,The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%).
NA,The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia.
NA,Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years.
NA,The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships.
NA,The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports.
NA,Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases.
NA,Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.
NA,In response to the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a shift globally from face to face consultations to remote consultations.
NA,In our department remote consultations have taken the form of telephone consultations.
NA,In this paper we set out to study a group of Irish psychiatrists' experience of these consultations.
NA,We identified recurrent themes in the existing literature on doctors' experience of telephone consultations with a view to determining the applicability of these themes to a group of Irish psychiatrists.
NA,A questionnaire was developed based on themes in the literature.
NA,This was sent to all psychiatrists working in a busy psychiatric service in Dublin.
NA,The questionnaire response rate was 72% (n = 26/35).
NA,Diagnostic challenges, the effect of phone consultation on the therapeutic alliance, challenges associated with the use of technology and ethical concerns were identified as issues.
NA,Flexibility in the working day and convenience were identified as possible benefits to telephone consultations.
NA,The group who participated in this research study identified a number of challenges to carrying out successful phone consultations.
NA,This study highlights the need at our clinical site for interventions to address the issues identified by staff.
NA,The findings also highlight the requirement for larger studies with stronger methodologies to determine the generalisability of our results.
NA,Chest CT may be used as a tool for rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection.
NA,Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region.
NA,Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (<i>n</i> = 21) or head trauma (<i>n</i> = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region.
NA,Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated.
NA,Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (<i>n</i> = 11), brain contusion (<i>n</i> = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (<i>n</i> = 2), brain metastasis (<i>n</i> = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (<i>n</i> = 8).
NA,Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients.
NA,Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection.
NA,Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative.
NA,Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%.
NA,The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high.
NA,However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19.
NA,The positive predictive value is poor.
NA,Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.
NA,The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted new interest among anesthesiologists and intensivists in controlling coughing and expectoration of potentially infectious aerosolized secretions during intubation and extubation.
NA,However, the fear of provoking laryngospasm may cause avoidance of deep or sedated extubation techniques which could reduce coughing and infection risk.
NA,This fear may be alleviated with clear understanding of the mechanisms and effective management of post-extubation airway obstruction including laryngospasm.
NA,We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1.
NA,The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2.
NA,The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can &quot;break&quot; laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature.
NA,We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.
NA,World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic and a global health emergency.
NA,Thus, it is necessary to clearly characterize clinical manifestations and management of COVID-19 infection in children to provide accurate information for healthcare workers.
NA,Accordingly, the present study was designed to review articles published on clinical manifestations and characteristics of children and infants with COVID-19.
NA,In this systematic review, medical databases including Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, SID, Medline, WHO and LitCovid were searched using English and Persian keywords including COVID-19, Pediatrics, Newborn, Coronavirus 2019, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Finally, data of 14 related articles were included in the study.
NA,A total of 2228 children, newborns and infants were studied.
NA,Clinical manifestation in children may be mild (72%), moderate (22%) or severe (6%), and the most common symptoms include dry cough (91%) and fever (96%).
NA,According to the included articles, two children had died, one of which was a 14-year-old boy and his exposure history and underlying disease were unclear, and the other was a male newborn with gestational age of 35 weeks and 5 days, birth weight of 2200, Apgar score of 8, 8 (1 min and 5 min) and his first symptom was increased heart rate.
NA,No differences were found between male and female children regarding infection with COVID-19.
NA,Most pediatrics were infected with COVID-19 due to family cluster or history of close contact.
NA,Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared to infected adults.
NA,We should pay special attention to early diagnosis and early treatment in children infected with COVID-19.
NA,Computed tomography (CT) imaging has quickly found its place as a beneficial tool in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,To date, only a few studies have reported the distribution of lung lesions by segment.
NA,This study aimed to evaluate the lobar and segmental distribution of COVID-19 pneumonia based on patients' chest CT scan.
NA,This was a retrospective study performed on 63 Iranian adult patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,All patients had undergone chest CT scan on admission.
NA,Demographic data and imaging profile, including segmental distribution, were evaluated.
NA,Moreover, a scoring scale was designed to assess the severity of ground-glass opacification (GGO).
NA,The relationship of GGO score with age, sex, and symptoms at presentation was investigated.
NA,Among included patients, mean age of patients was 54.2 ±14.9 (range: 26 - 81) years old and 60.3% were male.
NA,Overall, the right lower lobe (87.3%) and the left lower lobe (85.7%) were more frequently involved.
NA,Specifically, predominant involvement was seen in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe (82.5%).
NA,The most common findings were peripheral GGO and consolidation, which were observed in 92.1% and 42.9% of patients, respectively.
NA,According to the self-designed GGO scoring scale, about half of the patients presented with mild GGO on admission.
NA,GGO score was found to be equally distributed among different sex and age categories; however, the presence of dyspnea on admission was significantly associated with a higher GGO score (p= 0.022).
NA,Cavitation, reticulation, calcification, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance and nodules were not identified in any of the cases.
NA,COVID-19 mainly affects the lower lobes of the lungs.
NA,GGO and consolidation in the lung periphery is the imaging hallmark in patients with COVID-19 infection.
NA,Absence of bronchiectasis, solitary nodules, cavitation, calcifications, tree-in-bud appearance, and reversed halo-sign indicates that these features are not common findings, at least in the earlier stages.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection that can, in severe cases, result in cytokine storm, systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy that is prognostic of poor outcomes.
NA,While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19- induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic.
NA,It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients.
NA,Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients.
NA,Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience.
NA,The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19.
NA,We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.
NA,Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Coranavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently based on real-time PCR (RT-PCR) performed on either nasopharyngeal (NPS) or oropharyngeal (OPS) swabs; saliva specimen collection can be used, too.
NA,Diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is suboptimal, and some procedural mistakes may account for it.
NA,The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner.
NA,We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx.
NA,Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions.
NA,Regards OPS, gentle anterior tongue depression should be used to avoid swab contamination from the oral cavity during collection of secretions from the posterior pharyngeal wall.
NA,These procedural tricks would enhance diagnostic reliability.
NA,A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recently identified in patients with acute respiratory disease and spread quickly worldwide.
NA,A specific and rapid diagnostic method is important for early identification.
NA,The reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay is a rapid detection method for several pathogens.
NA,Assays were performed within 5-15 min as a one-step single tube reaction at 39 °C.
NA,In this study, we established two RT-RAA assays for the S and orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 using clinical specimens for validation.
NA,The analytical sensitivity of the RT-RAA assay was 10 copies for the S and one copy for the orf1ab gene per reaction.
NA,Cross-reactions were not observed with any of the other respiratory pathogens.
NA,A hundred percent agreement between the RT-RAA and real-time PCR assays was accomplished after testing 120 respiratory specimens.
NA,These results demonstrate that the proposed RT-RAA assay will be beneficial as it is a faster, more sensitive, and more specific tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study is to characterize the CT findings of 30 children from mainland China who had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020.
NA,Patient age ranged from 10 months to 18 years.
NA,Patients older than 18 years of age or those without chest CT examinations were excluded.
NA,Two cardiothoracic radiologists and a cardiothoracic imaging fellow characterized and scored the extent of lung involvement.
NA,Cohen kappa coefficient was used to calculate interobserver agreement between the readers. <b>RESULTS.</b> Among children, CT findings were often negative (77%).
NA,Positive CT findings seen in children included ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung distribution, a crazy paving pattern, and the halo and reverse halo signs.
NA,There was a correlation between increasing age and increasing severity of findings, consistent with reported symptomatology in children.
NA,Eleven of 30 patients (37%) underwent follow-up chest CT, with 10 of 11 examinations (91%) showing no change, raising questions about the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in children. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.
NA,Mechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19.
NA,(PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187). 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020.
NA,Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
NA,Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus.
NA,Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included.
NA,Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders.
NA,A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
NA,Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
NA,Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
NA,Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.
NA,Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.
NA,Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.
NA,World Health Organization.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the coronavirus disease COVID-19) is highly transmissible among people.
NA,Asymptomatic infections are also an important source of infection.
NA,Here, we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,We identified close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in northeast Chongqing who were RT-PCR+ yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections.
NA,We stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest CT, and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors.
NA,Between January and March, 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Of these, 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings.
NA,The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities.
NA,Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days (range 1 to 29), and 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,Nine subjects (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively.
NA,The median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 13 days, compared to 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,A portion of these asymptomatic individuals, with and without abnormal chest CT scans, were capable of transmitting the virus to others.
NA,Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential.
NA,Studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.
NA,Cancer diagnostics and surgery have been disrupted by the response of healthcare services to the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patient long-term survival.
NA,We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017.
NA,We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years.
NA,Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations.
NA,Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained.
NA,Per-patient delay of three/six months would cause attributable death of 4,755/10,760 of these individuals with loss of 92,214/208,275 life-years.
NA,For cancer surgery, average life-years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of three/six months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYG per patient).
NA,Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of three/six months.
NA,For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482,022 LYGs requiring of 1,052,949 HCRUs.
NA,Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs.
NA,Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival.
NA,Delay of three/six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of life-years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19.
NA,This rises to 26%/59% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained.
NA,To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.
NA,The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has spread rapidly all over the world after its appearance in December 2019, soon became a pandemic.
NA,In many places struck by the epidemic, clinical branches have prepared new guidelines for approaching the management of the disease in their area during the pandemic.
NA,Surgeons have also delayed elective surgeries.
NA,The first case of Covid-19 in Turkey was detected on March 10, 2020.
NA,After this date, 39 patients with a diagnosis of cancer were operated on in our clinic.
NA,In this study, we wanted to reveal the results of the cancer surgeries that we have performed during this period.
NA,While evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may decrease the viral load in patients with a COVID-19 infection, a number of case reports indicate adverse dermatologic effects of this potential treatment.
NA,To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment.
NA,A comprehensive EMBASE and MEDLINE search of original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis was conducted.
NA,Participant demographics, and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients.
NA,Females accounted for a significantly larger number of psoriatic cases compared to males and unreported sex (n=14, 77.8% vs. n=2, 11.1% vs n=2, 11.1% respectively).
NA,Additionally, 50% (n=9) of the cases did not have a history of psoriasis prior to taking HCQ.
NA,Of the 18 patients, 50.0% (n=9) experienced de novo psoriasis, 27.8% (n=5) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms and 22.2% (n=4) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration.
NA,HCQ treatment may result in induction, exacerbation, or relapse of psoriasis.
NA,Monitoring for adverse effects of HCQ treatment is necessary, and clinical trials are essential in characterizing the safety profile of HCQ use in patients with a COVID-19 infection.
NA,The epidemic of pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its harm degree is defined as a global &quot;pandemic&quot;.
NA,At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease.
NA,The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing.
NA,Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses.
NA,Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures.
NA,In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19.
NA,Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, which has subsequently led to a global pandemic.
NA,At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control.
NA,However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day.
NA,Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives.
NA,Data from the National Health Commission of China are used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies.
NA,A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented.
NA,This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fangcang shelter hospitals.
NA,In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12-13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria.
NA,Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice.
NA,The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out before sealing off the city have also been identified, and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu Migration Index.
NA,The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19.
NA,We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted.
NA,We estimate that England will be another epicentre owing to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19.
NA,Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic.
NA,The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19.
NA,Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases.
NA,Hospitals are important sources of pollutants resulted from diagnostic, laboratory and research activities as well as medicine excretion by patients, which include active component of drugs and metabolite, chemicals, residues of pharmaceuticals, radioactive markers, iodinated contrast media, etc.
NA,The discharge of hospital wastes and wastewater, especially those without appropriate treatment would expose the public in danger of infection.
NA,In particular, under the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic context in China, it is of great significance to reduce the health risks to the public and environment.
NA,In this study, technologies of different types of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection have been summarized.
NA,Liquid chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet irradiation disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastewater disinfection.
NA,While incineration, chemical disinfection, and physical disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastes disinfection.
NA,In addition, considering the characteristics of various hospital wastes, the classification and selection of corresponding disinfection technologies are discussed.
NA,On this basis, this study provides scientific suggestions for management, technology selection, and operation of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection in China, which is of great significance for development of national disinfection strategy for hospital wastes and wastewater during COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The evolving dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the increasing infection numbers require diagnostic tools to identify patients at high risk for a severe disease course.
NA,Here we evaluate clinical and imaging parameters for estimating the need of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment.
NA,We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
NA,Two radiologists evaluated the severity of findings in computed tomography (CT) images on a scale from 1 (no characteristic signs of COVID-19) to 5 (confluent ground glass opacities in over 50% of the lung parenchyma).
NA,The volume of affected lung was quantified using commercially available software.
NA,Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for ICU treatment.
NA,Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts.
NA,The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients.
NA,Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean ± standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.1, 0.86 ± 0.16 and 0.80 ± 0.1 and a receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.79 ± 0.1.
NA,The need for ICU treatment is independently associated with affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP, and IL-6.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a highly contagious infection, known as COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in late December 2019 and, since then, has become a global pandemic.
NA,Timely and accurate COVID-19 laboratory testing is an essential step in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,To date, assays based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory samples are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,Unfortunately, RT-PCR has several practical limitations.
NA,Consequently, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently required, both for alleviating the pressure on laboratories and healthcare facilities and for expanding testing capacity to enable large-scale screening and ensure a timely therapeutic intervention.
NA,To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results.
NA,Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Based on ten studies, we computed a pooled sensitivity of 64.8% (95%CI 54.5-74.0), and specificity of 98.0% (95%CI 95.8-99.0), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias.
NA,We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.
NA,During the COVID-19 emergency, the medical operating protocols have been largely modified for reducing any type of contamination risk, for working in a safe way and for making the patient feel in a safe environment.
NA,Telemedicine, smart phones and apps could represent important devices for the community, in order to prevent virus trasmission and to perform quick diagnosis and management at medical offices.
NA,This manuscript could be useful for clinicians with regard to the current state of the effectiveness of the telephone triage in this COVID-19 epidemic period.
NA,Therefore, it could be an important starting point for future perspectives about telemedicine and virtual patient management.
NA,We used quantified electroencephalography (qEEG) to define the features of encephalopathy in patients released from the intensive care unit after severe illness from COVID-19.
NA,Artifact-free 120-300 s epoch lengths were visually identified and divided into 1 s windows with 10% overlap.
NA,Differential channels were grouped by frontal, parieto-occipital, and temporal lobes.
NA,For every channel and window, the power spectrum was calculated and used to compute the area for delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) bands.
NA,Furthermore, Shannon's spectral entropy (SSE) and synchronization by Pearson's correlation coefficient () were computed; cases of patients diagnosed with either infectious toxic encephalopathy (ENC) or post-cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) encephalopathy were used for comparison.
NA,Visual inspection of EEGs of COVID patients showed a near-physiological pattern with scarce anomalies.
NA,The distribution of EEG bands was different for the three groups, with COVID midway between distributions of ENC and CRA; specifically, temporal lobes showed different distribution for EEG bands in COVID patients.
NA,Besides, SSE was higher and hemispheric connectivity lower for COVID.
NA,We objectively identified some numerical EEG features in severely ill COVID patients that can allow positive diagnosis of this encephalopathy.
NA,The purpose of an electronic health information system (EHIS) is to support health care workers in providing health care services to an individual client and to enable data exchange among service providers.
NA,The demand to explore the use of EHIS for diagnosis and management of communicable and non-communicable diseases has increased dramatically due to the volume of patient data and the need to retain patients in care.
NA,In addition, the advent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in high disease burdened low and middle income countries (LMICs) has increased the need for robust EHIS to enable efficient surveillance of the pandemic.
NA,EHIS has potential to enable efficient delivery of disease diagnostics services at point-of-care (POC) and reduce medical errors.
NA,This review provides an overview of literature on EHIS's with a focus on describing the key components of EHIS and presenting evidence on enablers and barriers to implementation of EHISs in LMICs.
NA,With guidance from the presented evidence, we proposed EHIS key stakeholders' roles and responsibilities to ensure efficient utility of EHIS for disease diagnosis and management at POC in LMICs.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally, and medical resources become insufficient in many regions.
NA,Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimisation is important.
NA,Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography.We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces.
NA,Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features.
NA,Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system.In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86).
NA,Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014).
NA,Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.
NA,The clinical features of rheumatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been reported.
NA,This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients and provide information for handling this situation in clinical practice.
NA,This is a retrospective case series study.
NA,Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020.
NA,Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p&lt;0.001).
NA,Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively.
NA,There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash.
NA,While lymphocytopaenia was seen in 57% of rheumatic patients, only one patient (5%) presented with leucopenia in rheumatic cases.
NA,Rheumatic patients presented with similar radiological features of ground-glass opacity and consolidation.
NA,Patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease showed massive fibrous stripes and crazy-paving signs at an early stage.
NA,Five rheumatic cases used hydroxychloroquine before the diagnosis of COVID-19 and none progressed to critically ill stage.
NA,Respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic patients infected with COVID-19.
NA,Differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and a flare of rheumatic disease should be considered.
NA,ChiCTR2000030795.
NA,To characterise the clinical features of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United Kingdom during the growth phase of the first wave of this outbreak who were enrolled in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, and to explore risk factors associated with mortality in hospital.

NA,This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.
NA,ISRCTN66726260.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, the European biobanking infrastructure is in a unique position to preserve valuable biological material complemented with detailed data for future research purposes.
NA,Biobanks can be either integrated into healthcare, where preservation of the biological material is a fork in clinical routine diagnostics and medical treatment processes or they can also host prospective cohorts or material related to clinical trials.
NA,The paper discussed objectives of BBMRI-ERIC, the European research infrastructure established to facilitate access to quality-defined biological materials and data for research purposes, with respect to the COVID-19 crisis: (a) to collect information on available European as well as non-European COVID-19-relevant biobanking resources in BBMRI-ERIC Directory and to facilitate access to these via BBMRI-ERIC Negotiator platform; (b) to help harmonizing guidelines on how data and biological material is to be collected to maximize utility for future research, including large-scale data processing in artificial intelligence, by participating in activities such as COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative; (c) to minimize risks for all involved parties dealing with (potentially) infectious material by developing recommendations and guidelines; (d) to provide a European-wide platform of exchange in relation to ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI) specific to the collection of biological material and data during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) seem to be at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 infection and associated complications due to their immunocompromised state, the older age and comorbidities.
NA,The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential.
NA,In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections.
NA,Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response.
NA,Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses.
NA,Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction.
NA,Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses.
NA,The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances.
NA,Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery.
NA,For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.
NA,The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.
NA,The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.
NA,The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a profound impact on the management of patients with cancer.
NA,In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread.
NA,Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research.
NA,In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging.
NA,We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer.
NA,As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed.
NA,As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently causing a pandemic and will likely persist in endemic form in the foreseeable future.
NA,Physicians need to correctly approach this new disease, often representing a challenge in terms of differential diagnosis.
NA,Although COVID-19 lacks specific signs and symptoms, we believe internists should develop specific skills to recognize the disease, learning its 'semeiotic'.
NA,In this review article, we summarize the key clinical features that may guide in differentiating a COVID-19 case, requiring specific testing, from upper respiratory and/or influenza-like illnesses of other aetiology.
NA,We consider two different clinical settings, where availability of the different diagnostic strategies differs widely: outpatient and inpatient.
NA,Our reasoning highlights how challenging a balanced approach to a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms can be.
NA,At present, clinical workup of COVID-19 remains a hard task to accomplish.
NA,However, knowledge of the natural history of the disease may aid the internist in putting common and unspecific symptoms into the correct clinical context.
NA,COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical care and research in the United States.
NA,Traditional evaluations for making an ALS diagnosis, measuring progression, and planning interventions rely on in-person visits that may now be unsafe or impossible.
NA,Evidence- and experience-based treatment options such as multidisciplinary team care, feeding tubes, wheelchairs, home health and hospice have become more difficult to obtain and in some places are unavailable.
NA,Additionally, the pandemic has impacted ALS clinical trials by impairing the ability to obtain measurements for trial eligibility, to monitor safety and efficacy outcomes, and to dispense study drug since these also often rely on in-person visits.
NA,We review opportunities for overcoming some of these challenges through telemedicine and novel measurements.
NA,These can re-optimize ALS care and research in the current setting and during future events that may limit travel and face to face interactions.

NA,The Child Neurology Society collaborated with the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium to issue an online statement April 6, 2020 of immediate recommendations to streamline diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of infantile spasms.
NA,The recommendations encourage use of telemedicine, outpatient over inpatient studies, and oral therapies as initial treatment.
NA,Each recommendation is earmarked as enduring if intended to outlast the pandemic, and limited if intended only during the duration of the pandemic.

NA,As the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 cases in the United States the initial test was developed and performed at the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
NA,As the number of cases increased the demand for tests multiplied, leading the CDC to utilize the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus.
NA,Many nucleic acid tests based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were developed, each with different techniques, specifications and turnaround time.
NA,As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial.
NA,The test supply became inadequate to meet the need that it had to be prioritized according to guidance.
NA,For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged.
NA,Here we review the timeline of test development, the turn-around times, the various approved tests and compare them as regards the genes they detect.
NA,We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests.
NA,We discuss the testing guidance for prioritization and their application in a hospital setting.
NA,As SARS-CoV-2 virus arrived in the USA causing the COVID-19 illness, one of the most talked about issues in the management of the disease and the resulting pandemic has been clinical testing.
NA,A unique situation arose of a communicable and highly contagious disease necessitating the rapid diagnosis of patients and the identification of non-symptomatic infected persons.
NA,Unfortunately, the USA did not have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved laboratory test for the illness.
NA,The FDA ultimately utilized its Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) on February 4, 2020 to allow for more rapid and widespread development and implementation of in-vitro testing.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, companies and organizations utilized the EUA to file applications for new tests based on different methodologies, amounting to 48 applications in the span of 3 months from the beginning of February to the end of April 2020.
NA,In addition, multiple other tests were put in place under a separate authorization by a Presidential memorandum in early March allowing laboratories that carry Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification to put tests in place without an EUA from the FDA.
NA,This created an unprecedented situation where the medical community and the public may not be familiar with the various new tests for COVID-19 that are offered to patients and hospitals.
NA,The purpose of this review is to provide information, up-to-date as of the date of submission of the manuscript to the journal, on the various tests that have been developed, their scientific basis and their interpretation.
NA,We give a real-world example demonstrating the time lag in the return of test results and review testing prioritization guidance since the supply of tests remains below the perceived need.
NA,The COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high impact on the healthcare system.
NA,Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system.
NA,The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan.
NA,Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread.
NA,This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images.
NA,In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy.
NA,Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution.
NA,We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model.
NA,We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once.
NA,To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs.
NA,The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others.
NA,The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario.
NA,As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes.
NA,We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has currently overtaken every other health issue throughout the world.
NA,There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues.
NA,Here we reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB), which still ranks as the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease globally.
NA,There may be grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped.
NA,TB control programmes will be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus, such that some activities cannot or will not be prioritised.
NA,This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes.
NA,Further, TB patients often have underlying co-morbidities and lung damage that may make them prone to more severe COVID-19.
NA,The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever.
NA,Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19.
NA,Children with TB are a vulnerable group especially likely to suffer as part of the &quot;collateral damage&quot;.
NA,There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TB-HIV, and this will require unpicking.
NA,Lessons for COVID-19 could be learned from the vast experience of running global TB control programmes, while the astonishingly rapid and relatively well co-ordinated response to COVID-19 demonstrates how existing programmes could be significantly improved.
NA,The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020.
NA,As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness.
NA,In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases.
NA,Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world.
NA,We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic.
NA,The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic.
NA,In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.
NA,Envelope protein of coronaviruses is a structural protein existing in both monomeric and homo-pentameric form.
NA,It has been related to a multitude of roles including virus infection, replication, dissemination and immune response stimulation.
NA,In the present study, we employed an immunoinformatic approach to investigate the major immunogenic domains of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein and map them among the homologue proteins of coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world.
NA,Also, when not available, we predicted the envelope protein structural folding and mapped SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.
NA,Envelope sequences alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated virus specimens; while the structural mapping of epitopes resulted in the interesting maintenance of the structural folding and epitope sequence localization also in the envelope proteins scoring a lower alignment score.
NA,In line with the One-Health approach, our evidences provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role of taxonomically related coronaviruses in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.
NA,The recent joint statement from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA) recommends neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) illness.
NA,The benefits of regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques on patient outcomes and healthcare systems are evident.
NA,Regional techniques are now additionally promoted as a mechanism to reduce aerosolizing procedures.
NA,However, caring for patients with COVID-19 illness requires rapid redefinition of risks and benefits-both for patients and practitioners.
NA,These should be fully considered within the context of available evidence and expert opinion.
NA,In this Daring Discourse, we present two opposing perspectives on adopting the ASRA/ESRA recommendation.
NA,Areas of controversy in the literature and opportunities for research to address knowledge gaps are highlighted.
NA,We hope this will stimulate dialogue and research into the optimal techniques to improve patient outcomes and ensure practitioner safety during the pandemic.
NA,Objectives Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the availability and quality of both therapeutic and diagnostic methods, the Belgian authorities have decided to launch a procedure for additional evaluation of the performance of serological tests offered for sale on the national territory.
NA,This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation.
NA,Methods A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG.
NA,Results The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided &quot;real world&quot; analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit.
NA,Comparison between the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and specificities regarding the determination of the IgG.
NA,Conclusions This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic represents a novel challenge for healthcare systems, and it affects even the daily urological practice.
NA,Italy was the first country after China to experience a lock-down period.
NA,Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological emergencies. we retrospectively reviewed urgent urological consultations requested by the Emergency Department (ED) of Padua University Hospital in the 36-day period between February 22nd and March 30th, 2020 and compared them to the prior year cases within a similar time frame (February 24th to March 31st, 2019).
NA,Pediatric population (age &lt; 15 years); surgical complications and traumas were excluded to avoid confounding from the reduction of activities during the lockdown.
NA,The number of daily consultations, the number of invasive procedures performed and admissions were evaluated, together with the predictors of admission were identified through multivariate logistic regression models.
NA,The final sample resulted in 107 consultations performed in 2020 and 266 in 2019.
NA,A higher number of daily consultations was performed during 2019 (7.33 vs 2.97, p &lt; 0.001).
NA,Similarly, the number of daily-invasive procedures was higher in 2019 (p = 0.006), while there was no difference in the number of daily admissions (15 vs 12, p = 0.80).
NA,On multivariate analysis, the year (2020 vs 2019, OR 2.714, 95% CI 1.096-6.757, p = 0.0297) was a significant predictor of admission.
NA,Urgent urology practice was affected during COVID-19 pandemic with a remarkable reduction in urgent urological consultations; furthermore, a higher risk of admissions was observed in 2020.
NA,The consequences of a potentially delayed diagnosis remain to be determined.
NA,The month of December 2019 became a critical part of the time of humanity when the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Wuhan, Hubei Province in China.
NA,As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans.
NA,In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly.
NA,Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions.
NA,The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea.
NA,However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms.
NA,It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
NA,Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
NA,Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
NA,Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
NA,A number of neurological disease complications have been seen following infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,While most person with COVID-19 respiratory disease demonstrate headache, nausea and vomiting, up to 40% present also experience dizziness, confusion, cerebrovascular disease, muscle pain, ataxia and seizures.
NA,Loss of taste and smell, defects in visual acuity and pain occur in parallel.
NA,Such central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms linked to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is often life threatening.
NA,Health care providers currently evaluating patients with neurologic symptoms need consider COVID-19 in any differential diagnosis.
NA,These considerations will facilitate prompt testing, isolation and prevention of viral transmission speeding best clinical outcomes.
NA,Graphical Abstract.
NA,Herein, molecular modeling techniques were used with the main goal to obtain candidates from a drug database as potential targets to be used against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This novel coronavirus, responsible by the COVID-19 outbreak since the end of 2019, became a challenge since there is not vaccine for this disease.
NA,The first step in this investigation was to solvate the isolated S-protein in water for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, being observed a transition from &quot;up&quot; to &quot;down&quot; conformation of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein with angle of 54.3 and 43.0 degrees, respectively.
NA,The RBD region was more exposed to the solvent and to the possible drugs due to its enhanced surface area.
NA,From the equilibrated MD structure, virtual screening by docking calculations were performed using a library contained 9091 FDA approved drugs.
NA,Among them, 24 best-scored ligands (14 traditional herbal isolate and 10 approved drugs) with the binding energy below -8.1 kcal/mol were selected as potential candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, preventing the human cell infection and their replication.
NA,For instance, the ivermectin drug (present in our list of promise candidates) was recently used successful to control viral replication <i>in vitro.</i> MD simulations were performed for the three best ligands@S-protein complexes and the binding energies were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach.
NA,Overall, it is highlighted an important strategy, some key residues, and chemical groups which may be considered on clinical trials for COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus.
NA,Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19.
NA,However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios.
NA,Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.
NA,A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease.
NA,Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30).
NA,The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group.
NA,The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method.
NA,The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria.
NA,The volume of CT dose index (CTDI<sub>vol</sub>), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically.
NA,There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p &gt; 0.05).
NA,In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05).
NA,However, significant differences was found in CTDI<sub>vol</sub>, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group.
NA,CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread in Italy in late February 2020.
NA,Almost all surgical services have been reorganized, with the aim of maintaining an adequate therapeutic path, especially for surgical emergencies.
NA,The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations.
NA,Surgeons from multiple Italian regions were invited answering to an online survey in order to make a snapshot of their current behaviors towards COVID-19-positive patients bearing urgent surgical diseases.
NA,Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire.
NA,Seventy-one questionnaires from institutions dealing with emergency surgery were accepted.
NA,Participating surgeons were equally subdivided from a geographical point of view, with a large proportion of public (97.2%) and non-academical (91.5%) centers.
NA,In 80.3% of cases, the hospitals treated COVID-19 patients; in 69.1% of centers, a change in work plan was necessary, and 33.8% of teams had almost a surgeon infected or in preventive quarantine.
NA,The vast majority of surgeons operated only on urgent cases (73.9%), but the number of interventions significantly dropped.
NA,Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment.
NA,The laparoscopic approach was used in 69.6% of interventions on COVID-19 patients.
NA,Strategies to protect health care workers against COVID-19 infection and to identify asymptomatic infected surgeons were suboptimal with respect to the WHO recommendations in 70.4% and 90.2% of centers, respectively.
NA,Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers.
NA,This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy.
NA,Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay.
NA,Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery.
NA,A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations.
NA,Corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant burden on the global health system.
NA,Considerable cardiovascular involvement has been reported among COVID-19 patients with higher ICU admission and mortality rates among patients with cardiovascular comorbidities.
NA,Consequently, diagnostic cardiovascular evaluations such as echocardiography are a crucial part of the disease management.
NA,On the other hand, providing safety for the patients and the healthcare personnel is a matter of great concern in the pandemic state.
NA,In this document, we have provided recommendations on performing echocardiography in hospital echocardiography labs and outpatient echocardiography clinics during the current COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease of 2019) outbreak.
NA,Prenatal maternal distress has a negative impact on the course of pregnancy, fetal development, offspring development and later psychopathologies.
NA,The study aimed to determine the extent to which the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may aggravate pregnant women prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology.
NA,Two cohorts of pregnant volunteer women were evaluated, one that was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (n=496) through advertisements in prenatal clinics in Quebec, Canada, from April 2018 to March 2020; the other (n=1258) was recruited online during the pandemic from April 2 to April 13 2020.
NA,Prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology were measured with the Kessler Distress Scale (K10), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).
NA,The 1754 pregnant women (M<sub>age</sub> =29.27, SD=4.23) were between 4 and 41 gestational weeks (M=24.80, SD=9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had post-high school training) and financially well-resourced (85.3% were above the low-income cut-off).
NA,A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational age, household income, education and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms (Wilks' λ=0.68, F<sub>6,1400</sub> =108.50, p &lt; 0.001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.32).
NA,According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES=0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES=0.22 and 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES=0.19), negative affectivity (ES = 0.96) and less positive affectivity (ES=0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort.
NA,Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms [OR=1.94, χ2(1)=10.05, p=.002].
NA,Multiple regression analyses indicated that COVID-19 pregnant women having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.
NA,Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms.
NA,Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.
NA,In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China causing many cases of severe pneumonia.
NA,World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths.
NA,The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation.
NA,The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators.
NA,The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.
NA,Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes.
NA,Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.
NA,The COVID epidemic is affecting individuals worldwide, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients are at risk due to their characteristics and age.
NA,We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after five weeks of lockdown in Spain.
NA,We tested 40 subjects with a diagnosis of MCI (20) or mild AD (20) from the Cognitive Stimulation Program of Cognitive Disorders Unit.
NA,All patients had undergone a previous evaluation during the month before the lockdown, and they were re-evaluated after 5 weeks of lockdown.
NA,The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D were used to evaluate the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life of patients and caregivers.
NA,The total baseline NPI score was 33.75 (22.28) vs 39.05 (27.96) after confinement (p=0.028).
NA,The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms affected were apathy (4.15 (3.78) vs 5.75 (4.02); p=0.002) and anxiety (3.95 (3.73) vs 5.30 (4.01); p=0.006) in MCI patients and apathy (2.35 (2.70) vs 3.75 (3.78); p=0.036), agitation (0.45 (1.14) vs 1.50 (2.66); p=0.029) and aberrant motor behaviour (1.25 (2.86) vs 2.00 (2.93); p=0.044) in AD patients.
NA,We did not observe differences in EuroQol-5D scores during the reevaluation.
NA,Approximately 30% of patients and 40% of caregivers reported a worsening of their health status during confinement.
NA,We have demonstrated the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5 weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.
NA,Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit.
NA,Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.
NA,We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19.
NA,The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents.
NA,We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group.
NA,Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded.
NA,The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). 96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria.
NA,Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital.
NA,After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223-1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368-1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218-1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273-1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.
NA,Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935-2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106-5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760-4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344-4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.
NA,We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.
NA,Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.
NA,William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
NA,This study aims to provide both a model by using cumulative cases and cumulative death toll for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) outbreak in 4 countries, China, Italy, South Korea, and Turkey, starting from the first diagnosis and to compare associated indicators.
NA,The most successful estimation was obtained from the cubic model with natural logarithm for China, Italy, South Korea, and Turkey.
NA,The success of the models was around 99%.
NA,However, differences began to emerge in China, Italy, and South Korea after the second week.
NA,Although the highest number of new cases per 1 million people in China was 9.8 on February 28, 2020; it was 108.4 on March 21, 2020, in Italy; and this was 16.6 on March 5, 2020, in South Korea.
NA,On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey.
NA,The log-cubic model proposed in this study has been set forth to obtain successful results for aforementioned countries, as well as to estimate the course of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Other factors such as climacteric factors and genetic differences, which may have an impact on viral spreading and transmission, would also have strengthened the model prediction capacity.
NA,During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients in intensive care units who are undergoing long-term intubation may require tracheostomy.
NA,There is controversy about indication and health care professionals' safety regarding the conventional or percutaneous technique.
NA,We performed a prospective analysis of a series of 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 comparing both tracheostomy techniques, safety, and prognosis clinical markers.
NA,The results show that the techniques are equally safe, without cases of infection in surgeons.
NA,The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score before surgery and the progression in ventilation support during the first 72 hours after tracheostomy are optimal prognostic markers for these patients.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised several issues regarding the management of surgical patients.
NA,The aim of the current study was to clarify the management of oncologic and surgical patients during the pandemic.
NA,Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers' safety, were included.
NA,The last date of research for this study was April 4, 2020.
NA,We analyzed 28 papers.
NA,Real-time polymerase chain reaction was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and computed tomography scans were considered useful for cases of diagnostic uncertainty.
NA,Cancer patients and surgical patients were confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and negative outcome.
NA,To guarantee adequate care to these patients, while minimizing the risk for infection, the early postponing of elective surgery, the creation of COVID-free facilities and the identification of COVID- dedicated operating theaters and teams have been proposed.
NA,The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers.
NA,Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer.
NA,Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting.
NA,Also, clinicians should value the importance of self-protection and mental health care.
NA,An outbreak of the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has sickened thousands of people in China.
NA,The purpose of this study was to explore the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
NA,This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 from a single centre.
NA,All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission.
NA,Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations.
NA,The study included 541 patients with COVID-19.
NA,A total of 144 (26.6%) patients had a history of CVD.
NA,The mortality of patients with CVD reached 22.2%, which was higher than that of the overall population of this study (9.8%).
NA,Patients with CVD were also more likely to develop liver function abnormality, elevated blood creatinine and lactic dehydrogenase (p&lt;0.05).
NA,Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026).
NA,Lymphocytes, haemoglobin and albumin below the normal range were pervasive in the CVD group (p&lt;0.05).
NA,The proportion of critically ill patients in the CVD group (27.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-CVD group (8.8%).
NA,Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that CVD (OR: 2.735 (95% CI 1.495 to 5.003), p=0.001) was associated with critical COVID-19 condition, while patients with coronary heart disease were less likely to reach recovery standards (OR: 0.331 (95% CI 0.125 to 0.880), p=0.027).
NA,Considering the high prevalence of CVD, a thorough CVD assessment at diagnosis and early intervention are recommended in COVID-19 patients with CVD.
NA,Patients with CVD are more vulnerable to deterioration.
NA,The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been unprecedented in its speed and effects.
NA,Interruption of its transmission to prevent widespread community transmission is critical because its effects go beyond the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and affect the health system capacity to provide other essential services.
NA,Highlighting the implications of such a situation, the predictions presented here are derived using a Markov chain model, with the transition states and country specific probabilities derived based on currently available knowledge.
NA,A risk of exposure, and vulnerability index are used to make the probabilities country specific.
NA,The results predict a high risk of exposure in states of small size, together with Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon.
NA,Nigeria will have the largest number of infections, followed by Algeria and South Africa.
NA,Mauritania would have the fewest cases, followed by Seychelles and Eritrea.
NA,Per capita, Mauritius, Seychelles and Equatorial Guinea would have the highest proportion of their population affected, while Niger, Mauritania and Chad would have the lowest.
NA,Of the World Health Organization's 1 billion population in Africa, 22% (16%-26%) will be infected in the first year, with 37 (29 - 44) million symptomatic cases and 150 078 (82 735-189 579) deaths.
NA,There will be an estimated 4.6 (3.6-5.5) million COVID-19 hospitalisations, of which 139 521 (81 876-167 044) would be severe cases requiring oxygen, and 89 043 (52 253-106 599) critical cases requiring breathing support.
NA,The needed mitigation measures would significantly strain health system capacities, particularly for secondary and tertiary services, while many cases may pass undetected in primary care facilities due to weak diagnostic capacity and non-specific symptoms.
NA,The effect of avoiding widespread and sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is significant, and most likely outweighs any costs of preventing such a scenario.
NA,Effective containment measures should be promoted in all countries to best manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 is the biggest challenge for national health systems for a century.
NA,While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, fractures still need to be treated, as some patients with non-deferrable pathologies.
NA,The aim of this paper is to report the early experience of an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons during this period.
NA,This is a mono-geographic, observational, retrospective, descriptive study.
NA,We collected data from the beginning of the epidemic (1 March 2020), during the pandemic lockdown period (declared in the country on March 16, 2020) until the end of our study period on April 15, 2020.
NA,All the 140 patients presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital during this period with a diagnosis of fracture, or trauma (sprains, dislocations, wounds) were included in the cohort.
NA,In addition, 12 patients needing hospitalization for planning a non-deferrable elective surgical treatment were included.
NA,A group of patients from the two same hospitals and treated during the same period (1<sup>st</sup> March 2018 to April 15, 2018) but previously was used as control.
NA,Of these 152 patients (mean age 45.5 years; range 1 to 103), 100 underwent a surgical procedure and 52 were managed non-operatively.
NA,Twenty-eight were children and 124 were adults.
NA,The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients.
NA,The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country.
NA,The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively.
NA,As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic.
NA,Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%.
NA,The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.
NA,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that are common in many animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats.
NA,Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans.
NA,On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called 'COVID-19', as a 'public health emergency of international concern'.
NA,This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article.
NA,In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus.
NA,The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems.
NA,However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health.
NA,This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19.
NA,We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique.
NA,We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020.
NA,Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles.
NA,Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area.
NA,After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms.
NA,The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers.
NA,Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail.
NA,This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment.
NA,The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered.
NA,Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements.
NA,The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.
NA,At the end of December 2019, a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) appeared as the third unheard of outbreak of human coronavirus infection in the 21st century.
NA,First, in Wuhan, China, the novel SARS-CoV2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO), as 2019-nCOV (COVID-19), and spread extremely all over the world.
NA,SARS-CoV2 is transmitted to individuals by human-to-human transmission leading to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory system injury.
NA,SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction.
NA,There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered.
NA,Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic.
NA,In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases.
NA,The new acute respiratory disease severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious.
NA,It has caused many deaths, despite a relatively low general case fatality rate (CFR).
NA,The most common early manifestations of infection are fever, cough, fatigue and myalgia.
NA,The diagnosis is based on the exposure history, clinical manifestation, laboratory test results, chest computed tomography (CT) findings and a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy is not already clear.
NA,There is no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population.
NA,In the third trimester, COVID-19 can cause premature rupture of membranes, premature labour and fetal distress.
NA,There are no data on complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection before the third trimester.
NA,COVID-19 infection is an indication for delivery if necessary to improve maternal oxygenation.
NA,Decision on delivery mode should be individualised.
NA,Vertical transmission of coronavirus from the pregnant woman to the fetus has not been proven.
NA,As the virus is absent in breast milk, the experts encourage breastfeeding for neonatal acquisition of protective antibodies.
NA,Months after the outbreak of a new flu-like disease in China, the entire world is now in a state of caution.
NA,The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
NA,Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
NA,This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.
NA,Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast imaging must be performed using safe practices.
NA,Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices.
NA,The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment.
NA,A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection.
NA,The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.
NA,In the era of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of infectious airborne aerosol generation during otolaryngologic procedures has been an area of increasing concern.
NA,The objective of this investigation was to quantify airborne aerosol production under clinical and surgical conditions and examine efficacy of mask mitigation strategies.
NA,Prospective quantification of airborne aerosol generation during surgical and clinical simulation.
NA,Cadaver laboratory and clinical examination room.
NA,Airborne aerosol quantification with an optical particle sizer was performed in real time during cadaveric simulated endoscopic surgical conditions, including hand instrumentation, microdebrider use, high-speed drilling, and cautery.
NA,Aerosol sampling was additionally performed in simulated clinical and diagnostic settings.
NA,All clinical and surgical procedures were evaluated for propensity for significant airborne aerosol generation.
NA,Hand instrumentation and microdebridement did not produce detectable airborne aerosols in the range of 1 to 10 μm.
NA,Suction drilling at 12,000 rpm, high-speed drilling (4-mm diamond or cutting burs) at 70,000 rpm, and transnasal cautery generated significant airborne aerosols (<i>P</i> &lt; .001).
NA,In clinical simulations, nasal endoscopy (<i>P</i> &lt; .05), speech (<i>P</i> &lt; .01), and sneezing (<i>P</i> &lt; .01) generated 1- to 10-μm airborne aerosols.
NA,Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (<i>P</i> &lt; .05).
NA,Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread.
NA,Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 μm under surgical conditions.
NA,During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing.
NA,Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.
NA,This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people.
NA,The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China.
NA,To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China.
NA,We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population.
NA,Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.
NA,We developed a machine learning classifier to identify &quot;sick posts,&quot; in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19.
NA,Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts.
NA,For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China.
NA,We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power.
NA,For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline.
NA,Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses.
NA,Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19.
NA,In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.
NA,Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been recognized as causative agents of respiratory tract infections.Our aim was to describe HCoV infections in hospitalized children in a prospective surveillance study for 14 years and compare them with other respiratory viruses.
NA,As a part of an ongoing prospective study to identify the etiology of viral respiratory infections in Spain, we performed the analysis of HCoV infections in children hospitalized in a secondary hospital in Madrid, between October 2005 and June 2018.
NA,Clinical data of HCoV patients were compared with those infected by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza.
NA,The study population consisted of 5131 hospitalizations for respiratory causes in children.
NA,A total of 3901 cases (75.9%) had a positive viral identification and 205 cases (4.1%) were positive for HCoV.
NA,Only 41 cases (20%) of HCoV infection were detected as single infections.
NA,Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia.
NA,Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger.
NA,Other viruses were associated with hypoxia more frequently than cases with HCoV; high fever was more common in influenza infections and bronchiolitis in respiratory syncytial virus group.
NA,Although a slight peak of circulation appears mostly in winter, HCoV has been detected throughout the year as well.
NA,HCoV infections represent a small fraction of respiratory infections that require hospitalization in children and their characteristics do not differ greatly from other respiratory viral infections.
NA,The scientific literature of coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly expanding.
NA,There is a growing evidence on the discrepancy between clinical symptoms and radiologic findings in many patients.
NA,This case report gives details about a patient with only mild symptoms but relatively severe radiological findings.
NA,The 75-year-old patient suffering from oncologic disease had a planned a F18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography/computer tomography scan with a routine oncological indication where incidental radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 were detected.
NA,After immediate isolation, the patient was transferred to the corresponding medical department, where further investigations verified the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,With this case, our aim is to raise the awareness for the importance of the instant evaluation of chest computer tomography series when performing planned imaging examination, especially in frail patients.
NA,With this practice, potential radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 could be identified in time, which fundamentally determines further patient management steps.
NA,Orv Hetil.
NA,2020; 161(23): 971-976.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical departments were forced to re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent procedures and non-deferrable oncological cases.
NA,There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department.
NA,Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature.
NA,A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.
NA,After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed.
NA,Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not.
NA,Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure.
NA,There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches.
NA,Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.
NA,Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.
NA,During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the practice medicine on a global scale during the year 2020.
NA,With fewer patients presenting to hospitals with the diagnosis of STEMI, healthcare workers are wondering what is causing this decline.
NA,This piece presents data from two medical centers and addresses several possible causes to explain this phenomenon.
NA,It was found that there was a statistically significant decrease from January to March 2020 in number of presenting STEMI diagnoses.

NA,São necessárias mais provas e mais dados, especialmente na Região das Américas, para estabelecer orientações e recomendações definitivas.
NA,The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease.
NA,At present, COVID-19 has no specific therapeutic drugs, and the main clinical treatment is symptomatic treatment and control of complications.
NA,On March 5, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China issued the <i>Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus</i> (<i>2019</i>-<i>nCoV</i>) <i>Infection</i> (<i>Trial Version 7</i>), which integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into the treatment of COVID-19.
NA,The purpose of this study is to summarize recent studies on the clinic application, pharmacological action, chemical substances and mechanism of Qingwen Baidu Decoction (QBD) on the treatment of various diseases.
NA,The results suggested that QBD has multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, antiviral, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antipyretic and so on.
NA,It has been used in the treatment of sepsis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, infantile pneumonia, sepsis-related encephalopathy, epidemic encephalitis B and other diseases.
NA,In addition, this study attempts to explore the possible mechanism of QBD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
NA,Through the analysis of the chemical substances, pharmacological action and mechanism of QBD, this paper will provide a reference theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by QBD.
NA,Background The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for innovation in cost-effective and easily produced surgical simulations for trainee education that are not limited by physical confines of location.
NA,This can be accomplished with the use of desktop three-dimensional (3D) printing technology.
NA,This study describes the creation of a low-cost and open-access simulation for anatomical learning and pedicle screw placement in the lumbar spine, which is termed the SpineBox.
NA,Materials and methods An anonymized CT scan of the lumbar spine was obtained and converted into 3D software files of the L1-L5 vertebral bodies.
NA,A computer-assisted design (CAD) software was used to assemble the vertebral models into a simulator unit in anatomical order to produce an easily prototyped simulator.
NA,The printed simulator was layered with foam in order to replicate soft tissue structures.
NA,The models were instrumented with pedicle screws using standard operative technique and examined under fluoroscopy.
NA,Results Ten SpineBoxes were created using a single desktop 3D printer, with accurate replication of the cortico-cancellous interface using previously validated techniques.
NA,The models were able to be instrumented with pedicle screws successfully and demonstrated quality representation of bony structures under fluoroscopy.
NA,The total cost of model production was under $10.
NA,Conclusion The SpineBox represents the first open-access simulator for the instruction of spinal anatomy and pedicle screw placement.
NA,This study aims to provide institutions across the world with an economical and feasible means of spine surgical simulation for neurosurgical trainees and to encourage other rapid prototyping laboratories to investigate innovative means of creating educational surgical platforms in the modern era.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting all urological cancer services.
NA,On March 19<sup>th</sup> the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) provided pragmatic guidance for prostate cancer diagnostic services (Table 1).(
NA,1).
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the current uncontrolled outbreak of infectious disease, has caused significant challenges throughout the world.
NA,A reliable rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 is demanded worldwide.
NA,The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain was one of the most quickly established methods in the novel viral pandemic and was considered as the gold standard for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,In this report, we illustrate our experience of applying a protocol from the Taiwan CDC and achieving assay optimization in the immediate circumstances to meet the urgent medical and public health needs.
NA,Dialysis patients are a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly further complications, but we have little information.
NA,The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a hospital haemodialysis (HD) unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID-19 (almost 1,000 patients in 100,000h).
NA,In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit.
NA,We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing.
NA,Fever was the most frequent symptom, 50% had lymphopenia and 18.4% &lt;95% O<sub>2</sub> saturation.
NA,Sixteen (43.2%) patients required hospital admission and 6 (16.2%) died.
NA,We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport.
NA,In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases.
NA,CONCLUSIONS: We detected a high prevalence of COVID-19 with a high percentage detected by screening; hence the need for proactive diagnosis to stop the pandemic.
NA,Most cases are managed as outpatients, however severe symptoms are also appearing and mortality to date is 16.2%.
NA,In terms of staff, 20% have required sick leave in relation to COVID-19.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic challenges health system capacities in many countries.
NA,National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortage of healthcare resources that have to be reallocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers and save as many lives as possible.
NA,Beyond that, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions.
NA,In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions.
NA,Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses.
NA,The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale, is outlined and discussed.
NA,The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored: it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,Colorectal cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources.
NA,Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.
NA,To investigate differences in manifestations and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection between those with and without rheumatic disease.
NA,We conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR), compared in a 1:2 ratio with matched comparators on age, sex and date of COVID-19 diagnosis, between 1 March and 8 April 2020, at Partners HealthCare System in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area.
NA,We examined differences in demographics, clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection.
NA,The main outcomes were hospitalisation, intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality.
NA,We identified 52 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 63 years; 69% female) and matched these to 104 non-rheumatic disease comparators.
NA,The majority (39, 75%) of patients with rheumatic disease were on immunosuppressive medications.
NA,Patients with and without rheumatic disease had similar symptoms and laboratory findings.
NA,A similar proportion of patients with and without rheumatic disease were hospitalised (23 (44%) vs 42 (40%)), p=0.50) but those with rheumatic disease required intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation more often (11 (48%) vs 7 (18%), multivariable OR 3.11 (95% CI 1.07 to 9.05)).
NA,Mortality was similar between the two groups (3 (6%) vs 4 (4%), p=0.69).
NA,Patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 infection were more likely to require mechanical ventilation but had similar clinical features and hospitalisation rates as those without rheumatic disease.
NA,These findings have important implications for patients with rheumatic disease but require further validation.
NA,In the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, only few data regarding lung pathology induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is available, especially without medical intervention interfering with the natural evolution of the disease.
NA,We present here the first case of forensic autopsy of a COVID-19 fatality occurring in a young woman, in the community.
NA,Diagnosis was made at necropsy and lung histology showed diffuse alveolar damage, edema, and interstitial pneumonia with a geographically heterogeneous pattern, mostly affecting the central part of the lungs.
NA,This death related to COVID-19 pathology highlights the heterogeneity and severity of central lung lesions after natural evolution of the disease.
NA,To summarize the chest CT imaging and clinical features of the initial COVID-19 patients and provide a clinical diagnostic method that is more effective and can be performed earlier.
NA,This retrospective study investigated the clinical, laboratory and imaging information of 25 patients in the Luoyang area.
NA,There were 15 (60%) male and 10 (40%) female patients ranging from 24 to 88 years old (52 ± 19.30).
NA,Data were analyzed by Microsoft Excel and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or percentage.
NA,Thirteen (52%) patients had been in Wuhan or were in contact with people who had been in Wuhan, and ten (40%) patients were infected by their families or colleagues.
NA,The median time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 7 days.
NA,Ninety-two percent of patients had respiratory symptoms, and 8% of them had digestive symptoms.
NA,Fever (92%), cough (60%) and fatigue (56%) were the most common symptoms.
NA,Most patients had a normal or reduced WBC (96%), reduced lymphocyte count (60%), increased CRP (48%) and increased ESR (44%).
NA,Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the typical radiological finding on chest CT.
NA,Characteristic chest CT imaging features could appear earlier than the viral nucleic acid assay results.
NA,• Early in the pandemic, numbers of patients undergoing non-COVID-19 emergent CTs dropped sharply but diagnostic yield did not increase, suggesting potentially undiagnosed emergencies in patients not seen in healthcare institutions.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic disease globally.
NA,While it mostly presents with respiratory symptoms, it has already been found that it could manifest with a series of neurological symptoms as well, either at presentation or during the course of the disease.
NA,Symptoms vary from non-specific such as headache or dizziness to more specific such as convulsions and cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
NA,This study aims to give an overview of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss the potential pathogenetic mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
NA,Clinicians and especially internists, neurologists, and infectious disease specialists should be aware of these symptoms and able to recognize them early.
NA,Prompt diagnosis and immediate management of the neurological manifestations of the novel coronavirus will not only improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients but will also prevent the dissemination of the disease due to misdiagnosed cases.
NA,The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies.
NA,While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant.
NA,Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions.
NA,Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms.
NA,Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders.
NA,Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression.
NA,We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision.
NA,This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.
NA,We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
NA,Serologic assays have been developed to detect infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an immunochromatography-based assay of human serum for COVID-19.
NA,The present study enrolled 149 subjects who had been tested by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 and were classified into two groups: 70 who were positive for COVID-19 and 79 who were negative for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
NA,An immunochromatography-based COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test on the sera of the study population was applied to measure the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve compared to RT-PCR, with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
NA,IgM or IgG antibodies were detected in 65 subjects (92.9%) classified as positive for COVID-19 and in 3 subjects (3.8%) classified as negative for COVID-19.
NA,The sensitivity and specificity percentages for IgM or IgG antibodies were 92.9% (95% CI 84.1 - 97.6) and 96.2% (95% CI 89.3 - 99.2), respectively, with 95.6% PPV and 93.8% NPV.
NA,The PPV rapidly improved with increasing disease prevalence from 19.8% to 96.1% in the presence of either IgM or IgG, while the NPV remained high with a change from 99.9% to 93.1%.
NA,The area under the ROC curve was 0.945 (95% CI 0.903 - 0.988) for subjects with either IgM or IgG positivity.
NA,In conclusion, the immunochromatography-based COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test is a useful and practical diagnostic assay for detection of COVID-19, especially in the presence of IgM or IgG antibodies.

NA,SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and infection by this virus results in COVID-19, manifesting predominantly respiratory symptoms in the lower respiratory system.
NA,Detection of viral genomic materials by RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosis.
NA,Suspected COVID-19 patients who had a documented history of exposure and exhibited symptoms, but did not have positive PCR test results, were generally self-quarantined with prescriptions aiming to help attenuate their symptoms.
NA,These prescriptions are however neither specific nor highly effective for COVID-19 treatment.
NA,Given the rapidly growing pandemic and overwhelmed medical system, the number of self-quarantined patients is increasing.
NA,There is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help patients relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and to potentially help increase their chances of survival and recovery from the infection.
NA,We report here a case of COVID-19 that never had a positive PCR test result during disease progression but was confirmed with antibody test post recovery.
NA,This patient was self-quarantined and received diammonium glycyrrhizinate, a steroid-like molecule, in combination with Vitamin C as alternative medicine.
NA,This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms.

NA,COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
NA,COVID-19 outbreak, which caused thousands of deaths, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.
NA,The infection has been reported to demonstrate different types of cutaneous manifestations including urticarial, maculopapular, papulovesicular, purpuric, livedoid, and thromboticischemic lesions.
NA,Given the high mortality rate of the infection, timely and accurate identification of relevant cutaneous manifestations may play a key role in the early diagnosis and management.
NA,In this study, we provide a review with a focus on the reported cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.

NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has rapidly spread globally.
NA,Cancer patients are at a higher risk of being infected with the coronavirus and are more likely to develop severe complications, as compared to the general population.
NA,The increasing spread of COVID-19 presents challenges for the clinical care of patients with gynecological malignancies.
NA,Concerted efforts should be put into managing gynecological malignancies in an orderly manner by strictly implementing the measures that are specifically developed for controlling the spread of COVID-19.
NA,We have drafted <i>Recommendations on Management of Gynecological Malignancies during the COVID-19 Pandemic</i> based on our experience on controlling COVID-19 pandemic in China.
NA,We recommend that patients with gynecological malignancies should be managed in hierarchical and individualized manners in combination with local conditions related to COVID-19.
NA,Medical care decision should be balanced between controlling COVID-19 pandemic spread and timely diagnosis and treatment for gynecologic oncology patients.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the novel coronavirus (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) as a global public health emergency.
NA,COVID-19 threatens to curtail patient access to evidence-based treatment.
NA,Medicine is changing, basically due to the limited available resources.
NA,In the field of gynecologic oncology, we have to re-design our treatments' paradigm.
NA,During COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the highest priority is to achieve the maximum benefit from less demanding procedures.
NA,Extensive procedures should be avoided, in order to reduce hospitalization and postoperative events that might increase the in-hospital spread of the virus.
NA,There are ongoing concerns on the use of laparoscopic procedures, related to the possible contamination of the staff working in the operation room.
NA,Other minimally invasive techniques, including, vaginal surgery as well as robotic-assisted and isobaric procedures would be preferred over laparoscopy.
NA,A fair allocation of resources is paramount adequate treatments.
NA,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China by the end of 2019, and then, the disease spread across China and became a global pandemic.
NA,Nevertheless, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 until now.
NA,In addition to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19 is active to study and screen effective antiviral drugs, and has found that chloroquine, an old antimalarial,shows activity against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
NA,Currently, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, two chloroquine derivatives, are under clinical use.
NA,Although these two agents exhibit similar mechanisms of drug actions, there is a difference between these two chemicals in terms of target populations, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions.
NA,This paper summarizes the currently available data and experiences from clinical treatment for malaria with chloroquine drugs, so as to provide insights into the more rational use of chloroquine agents for the treatment of COVID-19. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019 年底, 我国湖北省武汉市出现了新型冠状病毒肺炎 疫情, 随后在全国扩散并成为全球大流行。
NA,由于尚无针对新型冠 状病毒的特效治疗药物和疫苗, 我国新型冠状病毒感染救治临床 专家团队在救治新型冠状病毒感染患者的同时, 积极研究和筛选 有效抗病毒治疗药物, 发现一种古老的抗疟药——氯喹有一定抗 新型冠状病毒效果, 随后纳入我国新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案。
NA,目前, 临床应用的是氯喹衍生物磷酸氯喹和硫酸羟氯喹, 这两种药物虽药理机制相近, 但其治疗对象、疗效和不良反应均存在一定差异。
NA,本文拟通过对氯喹类药物已有研究和在疟疾临床治疗 中的经验总结, 为我国临床专家更科学合理地使用氯喹类药物进 行新型冠状病毒肺炎治疗提供参考。.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2).
NA,Cardiovascular disease and, in particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has emerged as an important consideration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
NA,The diagnosis of VTE using standardized objective testing is problematic in these patients, given the risk of infecting non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and hospital personnel, coupled with the usual challenges of performing diagnostic testing in critically-ill patients.
NA,Early reports suggest a high incidence of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe illness, that is similar to the high VTE rates observed in patients with other viral pneumonias, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).
NA,The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment.
NA,Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.
NA,In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers.
NA,In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
NA,The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
NA,This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.
NA,Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.
NA,In spite of the relatively high morbidity and mortality, there is no approved medication yet for COVID-19.
NA,There are more than 200 ongoing trials on different drugs or vaccines, but new medications may take until 2021 to develop.
NA,Defining the optimal number of patients to be included in a study is a considerable challenge in these interventional researches.
NA,Ethical considerations prompt researchers to minimize the number of patients included in a trial.
NA,This gains particular importance when the disease is rare or lethal which is particularly so in the case of COVID-19.
NA,It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed modalities for the treatment of diseases.
NA,These tools should be effective, yet efficient, for rapid testing of such treatments.
NA,Sequential analysis has not been frequently used in many clinical trials where it should have been used.
NA,None of the authors in published literature, as far as we know, used sequential analysis techniques to test potential drugs for COVID-19.
NA,In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.
NA,There is a growing trend in the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and telemedicine, especially during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.
NA,Tongue diagnosis is an important component of TCM diagnosis.
NA,However, the procedure of obtaining tongue images has not been standardized and the reliability of tongue diagnosis by smartphone tongue images has yet to be evaluated.
NA,The first objective of this study was to develop an operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis.
NA,The second and main objective of this study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of tongue coating diagnosis using the operating classification scheme.
NA,An operating classification scheme for tongue coating was developed using a stepwise approach and a quasi-Delphi method.
NA,First, tongue images (n=2023) were analyzed by 2 groups of assessors to develop the operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis.
NA,Based on clinicians' (n=17) own interpretations as well as their use of the operating classification scheme, the results of tongue diagnosis on a representative tongue image set (n=24) were compared.
NA,After gathering consensus for the operating classification scheme, the clinicians were instructed to use the scheme to assess tongue features of their patients under direct visual inspection.
NA,At the same time, the clinicians took tongue images of the patients with smartphones and assessed tongue features observed in the smartphone image using the same classification scheme.
NA,The intra-rater agreements of these two assessments were calculated to determine which features of tongue coating were better retained by the image.
NA,Using the finalized operating classification scheme, clinicians in the study group assessed representative tongue images (n=24) that they had taken, and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of their assessments was evaluated.
NA,Intra-rater agreement between direct subject inspection and tongue image inspection was good to very good (Cohen K range 0.69-1.0).
NA,Additionally, when comparing the assessment of tongue images on different days, intra-rater reliability was good to very good (K range 0.7-1.0), except for the color of the tongue body (K=0.22) and slippery tongue fur (K=0.1).
NA,Inter-rater reliability was moderate for tongue coating (Gwet AC2 range 0.49-0.55), and fair for color and other features of the tongue body (Gwet AC2=0.34).
NA,Taken together, our study has shown that tongue images collected via smartphone contain some reliable features, including tongue coating, that can be used in mHealth analysis.
NA,Our findings thus support the use of smartphones in telemedicine for detecting changes in tongue coating.
NA,Due to demographic change and, more recently, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent.
NA,One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters.
NA,However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied.
NA,This could be related to the lack of user involvement in research and development.
NA,This study focused on satisfaction of ICU staff with the current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements.
NA,We aimed to identify aspects disturbing patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff is willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring.
NA,We further desired to uncover differences in the responses of the professional groups.
NA,This survey study was realized with ICU staff from four ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020.
NA,We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff about clinical requirements of future patient monitoring.
NA,Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and Chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups.
NA,Eighty-six of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire.
NA,The majority stated to feel confident using the patient monitoring, but high rates of false positive alarms and the many sensor cables were considered to disturb patient care.
NA,Wireless sensors, reduction of false positive alarms and hospital standard operating procedures (SOP) for alarm management were demanded.
NA,Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were split.
NA,Regarding its use, most respondents indicated responsibility for multiple wards or earlier alerting.
NA,AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and increased risk of mortality, as well as to have guidelines for therapy and diagnostics proposed.
NA,Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote usage of an AI.
NA,The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for ICU and desired more time for it.
NA,Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about using mobile phones for remote monitoring, and AI-based intelligent alarm management.
NA,This survey study among ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine.
NA,Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm SOPs, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing digital literacy of ICU staff.
NA,Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

NA,Spain has been one of the countries most severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,This study aims to describe a series of children admitted to a PICU due to coronavirus disease 2019 infection.
NA,Prospective observational study.
NA,Tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain.
NA,Children admitted to the PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020.
NA,Observational study.
NA,Epidemiologic data, previous clinical characteristics, support therapy needed, imaging tests, laboratory observations on admission, and pharmacologic therapy.
NA,Eleven children were admitted to the PICU, with suspected coronavirus disease 2019; the polymerase chain reaction test was positive in seven.
NA,The median age was 100.7 months (range, 0.5-162).
NA,Five were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward.
NA,The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0-9), and Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0-16).
NA,All children were previously healthy except one (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation).
NA,Respiratory symptoms and fever were prevalent.
NA,A chest radiograph led to a pneumonia diagnosis.
NA,Not all patients presented with lymphopenia on admission.
NA,D-Dimer and ferritin were elevated.
NA,All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four.
NA,Mechanical ventilation was necessary in two patients on the first day of PICU admission.
NA,Two children required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support.
NA,Tocilizumab was applied in two intubated children.
NA,Also, four children received heparin.
NA,No patients died.
NA,On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old.
NA,Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy.
NA,Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission.
NA,These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.
NA,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a global phenomenon has presented clinicians around the world with multiple challenges.
NA,Thromboembolic events are recognised complications of viral infection, but the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary thrombotic complication in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be challenging because of the similarities of presentation, logistical considerations of diagnosis in a patient isolated for infection control reasons and the effects of cognitive errors in diagnostic reasoning.
NA,We present the case of a patient who was diagnosed with a pulmonary thrombotic complication during inpatient care for COVID-19.
NA,The haemostasis parameters we observed, including increased levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, point towards a relevant involvement of endothelial cells in patients with severe COVID-19.
NA,We suggest that it is possible to hypothesise a spectrum of secondarily acquired, prothrombotic coagulopathy mediated by the endothelial interaction with SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of mortality in a subset of patients with a complicated clinical course of COVID-19.
NA,We support the recommendation of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis for inpatients with COVID-19 as a very minimum in the absence of strict contraindications, while recognising that pulmonary thrombotic complications can occur under standard thromboprophylaxis.
NA,We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with COVID-19 where a discrepant evolution of C-reactive protein and D-dimer is observed.
NA,Therapeutic levels of anticoagulation are obligatory where new evidence of a macrovascular thrombotic complication has been documented.
NA,More research to delineate the macro- and microvascular thrombotic complications of COVID-19, and the therapeutic implications for this patient group is required.
NA,To determine whether the course of COVID-19 is more severe in patients with MS and if MS disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) affect the risk of contracting the disease.
NA,In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system.
NA,Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis.
NA,We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography.
NA,We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models.
NA,Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
NA,Only two patients required hospitalization.
NA,No patient required intensive care.
NA,In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values&lt;0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
NA,Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
NA,(RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005).
NA,The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.
NA,B-cell depleting antibodies may increase the susceptibility to contracting COVID-19.
NA,In the context of the pandemic, the rapid emergency use authorisation of diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 has meant there are few peer-reviewed published studies of clinical performance of commercial assays.
NA,To evaluate the clinical performance of AusDiagnostics respiratory multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We reviewed the results following implementation of AusDiagnostics respiratory multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2, and compared with an in-house RT-PCR assay at our State Reference Laboratory.
NA,Initial validation using AusDiagnostics coronavirus multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated good concordance with the State Reference Laboratory.
NA,After implementing the AusDiagnostics respiratory multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2, we tested 7839 samples. 127 samples in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected using the AusDiagnostics assay were referred for testing at the State Reference Laboratory, with concordant results in 118/127 (92.9%) of samples.
NA,After resolution of discrepancies, 125/127 (98.4%) of AusDiagnostics results were determined to be true positive results.
NA,Out of 7839 samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 during this period, only 2 tests (0.02%) were indeterminate results.
NA,The AusDiagnostics respiratory MT-PCR assay is a reliable assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) using an online survey of 398 adult Amazon MTurk workers in the U.S.
NA,Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the CAS measures a reliable (α = 0.92), unidimensional construct with a structure that was shown to be invariant across gender, race, and age.
NA,Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump).
NA,The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of ≥9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.
NA,Overall, these findings are largely consistent with the results of the first CAS investigation and support the validity of this mental health screener for COVID-19 related research and practice.
NA,To present seven pediatric patients with appendicitis, all with late diagnosis resulting from different aspects of the fear from the current global COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Cases were collected from three pediatric surgical wards.
NA,Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed.
NA,All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis.
NA,Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation.
NA,Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs. 11%, p-value 0.06).
NA,The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common pediatric medical conditions.
NA,We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.
NA,As the novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) outbreak progresses rapidly, staying home is recommended for suspected patients; however, the safety of this recommendation is uncertain.
NA,In Korea, non-hospital facilities called &quot;living and treatment centers (LTCs)&quot; have been established since 5 March 2020.
NA,The LTCs provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the safety of selection criteria for low-risk groups.
NA,Between 5 March and 9 April 2020, patients with COVID-19 who met the following criteria were admitted to the LTC; alert, age below 65 years old, no underlying disease or well-controlled underlying disease, body temperature below 38.0°C, whether taking antipyretics or not, and no dyspnea.
NA,Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened.
NA,A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5).
NA,Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation.
NA,During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization.
NA,The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis.
NA,LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.
NA,Cancer patients have been reported to be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and deaths.
NA,We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).
NA,An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13, 2020, for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs.
NA,Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features, and outcome.
NA,Data extraction was done on April 25, 2020.
NA,COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT scan abnormalities.
NA,Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed.
NA,Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N = 41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily.
NA,Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis.
NA,We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions.
NA,Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized, and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit.
NA,At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19.
NA,All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities.
NA,In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (&gt; 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.
NA,This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.
NA,Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.
NA,State-level stay-at-home orders were monitored to determine their effect on the rate of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses.
NA,Confirmed cases were tracked before and after state-level stay-at-home orders were put in place.
NA,Linear regression techniques were used to determine slopes for log case count data, and meta analyses were conducted to combine data across states.
NA,The results were remarkably consistent across states and support the usefulness of stay-at-home orders in reducing COVID-19 infection rates.
NA,To describe the infection control strategy to achieve zero nosocomial transmission of symptomatic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 during the pre-pandemic phase (the first 72 days after announcement of pneumonia cases in Wuhan) in Hong Kong.
NA,Administrative support with the aim of zero nosocomial transmission by reducing elective clinical services, decanting wards, mobilizing isolation facilities, providing adequate personal protective equipment, coordinating laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnosis under 4-tier active surveillance for hospitalized- and out-patients, and organizing staff forum and training was implemented under the framework of preparedness plan in Hospital Authority.
NA,The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003.
NA,Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
NA,Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak.
NA,The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p&lt;0.001).
NA,Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,<b>Background:</b> Several point-of-care (POC) molecular tests have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.<b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.<b>Study design:</b> The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (<i>E</i>) gene.
NA,Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen's kappa coefficient.<b>Results:</b> Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.82).
NA,Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7.
NA,NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).<b>Conclusion:</b> Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement.
NA,However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load.
NA,The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.
NA,Pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with high intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.
NA,We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting.
NA,We conducted a retrospective case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 ICUs in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between Feb. 21 and Apr.
NA,14, 2020.
NA,Demographic, management and outcome data were collected by review of patient charts and electronic medical records.
NA,Between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020, 117 patients were admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The median age was 69 (interquartile range [IQR] 60-75) years, and 38 (32.5%) were female.
NA,At least 1 comorbidity was present in 86 (73.5%) patients.
NA,Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 74 (63.2%) patients.
NA,The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU.
NA,Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient.
NA,As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home.
NA,In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was lower than in previously published studies.
NA,These data suggest that the prognosis associated with critical illness due to COVID-19 may not be as poor as previously reported.
NA,The reported number of new cases underestimates the real spread of COVID-19 pandemic because of non-tested asymptomatic people and limited global access to reliable diagnostic tests.
NA,In this context, COVID-19 mortality with confirmed diagnosis becomes an attractive source of information to be included in the analysis of perspectives and proposals.
NA,Objective data are required to calculate the capacity of resources provided by health systems.
NA,New strategies are needed to stabilize or minimize the mortality surge.
NA,However, we will not afford this goal until more alternatives were available.
NA,We still need an effective treatment, an affordable vaccine, or a collective achievement of sufficient immunity (reaching up to 70% of the whole population).
NA,At any time, the arriving waves of the pandemic are testing the capacity of governments.
NA,The health services struggle to keep the plateau in a steady-state below 100 deaths per million inhabitants.
NA,Therefore, it is necessary to increase the alternatives and supplies based on the current and near-future expected demands imposed by the number of deaths by COVID-19.
NA,Estimating COVID-19 mortality in various scenarios with the gradual release of social constraints will help predict the magnitude of those arriving waves.
NA,A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in December 2019.
NA,Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a &quot;public-health emergency of international concern&quot; due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide.
NA,Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.
NA,Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.
NA,Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain.
NA,Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.
NA,The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target.
NA,Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.
NA,Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic affecting people at high risk and particularly at advanced age, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.
NA,As cardiovascular patients are at high risk but also have dyspnea and fatigue as leading symptoms, prevention, diagnostics and treatment in these patients are important to provide adequate care for those with or without COVID-19 but most importantly when comorbid cardiovascular conditions are present.
NA,Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes.
NA,As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified.
NA,As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn.
NA,As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention.
NA,The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) is historically one of the most severe acute respiratory syndromes and pandemics to affect the globe in the twenty-first century.
NA,Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality.
NA,Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes.
NA,This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19.
NA,Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes.
NA,Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality.
NA,Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population.
NA,Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.
NA,Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19.
NA,Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes.
NA,Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis.
NA,Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome.
NA,A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.
NA,The recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised several concerns in reproductive medicine.
NA,The aim of this review is to summarize available evidence providing an official position statement of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) METHODS: A comprehensive Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library search was performed.
NA,Due to the limited evidence and the lack of studies, it was not possible to formulate recommendations according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria.
NA,Several molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 can justify the presence of virus within the testis and possible alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function.
NA,Orchitis has been reported as a possible complication of SARS-CoV infection, but similar findings have not been reported for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome.
NA,Finally, available data do not support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma seminal fluid of infected subjects.
NA,Data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological consultation and evaluation of gonadal function including semen analysis should be suggested.
NA,Studies in larger cohorts of currently infected subjects are warranted to confirm (or exclude) the presence of risks for male gametes that are destined either for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen or for assisted reproduction techniques.
NA,Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the availability of hospital resources worldwide.
NA,The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM).
NA,The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey.
NA,A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments.
NA,An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019.
NA,Personal data were analysed per individual responder.
NA,Organisation data were evaluated per single department.
NA,Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated.
NA,Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%).
NA,Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%).
NA,In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%).
NA,A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively.
NA,Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%).
NA,Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%).
NA,Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%).
NA,According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals.
NA,New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.
NA,To define the uniqueness of chest CT infiltrative features associated with COVID-19 image characteristics as potential diagnostic biomarkers.
NA,We retrospectively collected chest CT exams including n = 498 on 151 unique patients RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and n = 497 unique patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
NA,Both COVID-19 and CAP image sets were partitioned into three groups for training, validation, and testing respectively.
NA,In an attempt to discriminate COVID-19 from CAP, we developed several classifiers based on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
NA,We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP.
NA,The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary.
NA,One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56-0.85).
NA,This model allowed for the identification of 8-50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases.
NA,However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases.
NA,• Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans.
NA,• ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms.
NA,• Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases.
NA,Several commercial assays for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR are available but few of them were assessed.
NA,We evaluate the Allplex 2019-nCoV (Seegene) assay using 41 nasopharyngeal samples.
NA,The rates of agreement were 92.7% and 100% with the GeneFinder COVID-19 plus (Elitech) and the diagnosis of the infectious disease specialist respectively.
NA,Four samples display a Ct &lt; 22.0 for the E and RdRp genes while the N gene was not detected, suggesting a variability of the viral sequence.
NA,There was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses.
NA,The Allplex 2019-nCoV appears as a reliable method, but additional evaluations using more samples are needed.
NA,RT-PCR assays should probably include at least 2 viral targets.
NA,We read with interest the paper entitled «The impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease on 95 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective study.»<sup>1</sup> The authors retrospectively reported that hospitalized patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) had poorer clinical outcomes compared with those without LPR according to Reflux Symptom Index (RSI).
NA,The LPR diagnosis was based on RSI&gt;13, which is the threshold used by Belafsky et al. to suspect LPR.<sup>2</sup> This article is protected by copyright.

NA,As the world accommodates to the COVID-19 pandemic, routine in-person medical services are resuming.
NA,The resumption of non-urgent electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing faces unique challenges due to the long duration of the procedure and direct close contact with patients, including studies with risk of exposure to oropharyngeal secretions.
NA,We provide consensus guidance for resumption of EDX testing, addressing scheduling, patient arrival and registration, use of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 screening and testing, the performance of EDX in outpatient and inpatient settings, cleaning and maintenance of the EDX equipment and laboratory, balancing trainee safety and training requirements, and patient care issues.
NA,These are broad recommendations which need to be adapted to local COVID-19 risks, institutional guidelines and policies, and changing federal, state and local regulations, and to changes in the pandemic over time.

NA,Understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 is rapidly evolving with new articles on the subject daily.
NA,This flood of articles can be overwhelming for busy practicing clinicians looking for key pieces of information that can be applied in daily practice.
NA,This review article synthesizes the reported imaging findings in pediatric COVID-19 across the literature, offers imaging differential diagnostic considerations and useful radiographic features to help differentiate these entities from COVID-19, and provides recommendations for ordering imaging studies to evaluate suspected cases of pediatric COVID-19.

NA,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a crucial tool for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This dataset brief presents the exploration of a shotgun proteomics dataset acquired on SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.
NA,Proteins from inactivated virus samples were extracted, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were identified by data-dependent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry.
NA,The 101 peptides reporting for six viral proteins were specifically analyzed in terms of their analytical characteristics, species specificity and conservation, and their proneness to structural modifications.
NA,Based on these results, a shortlist of 14 peptides from the N, S, and M main structural proteins that could be used for targeted mass-spectrometry method development and diagnostic of the new SARS-CoV-2 is proposed and the best candidates are commented.

NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 is currently of global concern.
NA,Cancer patients are advised to stay at home in case of potential infection, which may cause delays of routine diagnosis and necessary treatment.
NA,How colorectal surgeons should manage this during the epidemic remains a big challenge.
NA,To evaluate the feasibility of routine colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 and to offer some Chinese recommendations to colorectal surgeons throughout the world.
NA,A total of 166 patients receiving colorectal surgery from 20th December 2019 to 20th March 2020 at Department of General Surgery in Chinese General Hospital of People's Liberation Army were enrolled, and further divided into two groups based on before or after admission date of 20th January 2020.
NA,Clinicopathologic data such as hospital stay and economic data such as total costs were collected and analyzed retrospectively.
NA,Longer hospital stay, higher proportion of non-local patients and more hospitalization cost were found in the post-20 January group (special-time group) (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.05 respectively).
NA,Apart from this, no difference existed with regard to baseline demographical data such as age, sex and height, as well as clinicopathological data such as previous history, surgery time, operation extent and TNM staging.
NA,This real-world study indicated that performing colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic might be safe and feasible based on comprehensive screening and investigation.
NA,We have summarized several recommendations here, hoping to help surgeons from related departments across the world.

NA,The rapid emergence of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has necessitated the implementation of diverse pandemic control strategies throughout the world.
NA,In order to effectively control the spread of this disease, it is essential that it be diagnosed at an early stage so that patients can be reliably quarantined such that disease spread will be slowed.
NA,At present, the diagnosis of this infectious form of coronavirus pneumonia is largely dependent upon a combination of laboratory testing and imaging analyses of variable diagnostic efficacy.
NA,In the present report, we reviewed prior literature pertaining to the diagnosis of different forms of pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and assessed two different potential diagnostic approaches.
NA,We ultimately found that computed tomography (CT) was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than was a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based approach (P = 0.0041), and chest radiography (P = 0.0100).
NA,Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible in order to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic.

NA,Prior research on nanotechnologies in diagnostics, prevention and treatment of coronavirus infections is reviewed.
NA,Gold nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots in colorimetric and immunochromatographic assays, silica nanoparticles in a polymerase chain reaction and spike protein nanospheres as antigen carriers and adjuvants in vaccine formulations present notable examples in diagnostics and prevention, while uses of nanoparticles in coronavirus infection treatments have been merely sporadic.
NA,The current absence of antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, might be largely due to the underuse of nanotechnologies.
NA,Elucidating the interface between nanoparticles and coronaviruses is timely, but presents the only route to the rational design of precisely targeted therapeutics for coronavirus infections.
NA,Such a fundamental approach is also a viable prophylaxis against future pandemics of this type.
NA,The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has caused a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses.
NA,The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection.
NA,However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia).
NA,Transcriptional aspects of three core elements - pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses - were interrogated.
NA,Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity.
NA,The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance.
NA,Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses.
NA,Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways such as cytokine signaling.
NA,The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (AUC of 0.75-0.89) and indicating disease severity.
NA,Compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections, and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways such as interferon gamma signaling.
NA,The immune-associated host transcriptional signatures of COVID-19 hold promise as a tool for improving COVID-19 diagnosis and indicating disease severity.
NA,Increasing evidence indicates immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) after covid-19, but it remains unclear for how long the protection remains.
NA,Serology testing seems to have a higher sensitivity than molecular diagnostics from 8 days after onset of symtoms, and should be part of risk assessment and epidemiological studies of COVID-19.
NA,The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant.
NA,Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies.
NA,Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity.
NA,Carefully selected serological POC tests for sars-cov-2 can be used in large scale testing but should only be used by licensed medical staff able to understand their limitations and interpret the results.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,This paper aims to examine the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19.
NA,We evaluated CT images obtained between 10 January 2019 and 16 February 2020 at Taihe Hospital.
NA,Scans were conducted 2-6 times per patient and the re-testing interval was 2-7 days.
NA,Ninety-five patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were included in this study and we retrospectively analysed their CT imaging characteristics.
NA,Ninety-five patients underwent 2-3 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and received a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Fifty-three were male and 42 were female, and their mean age was 42 ± 12 years (range: 10 months to 81 years).
NA,Sixty-nine patients (72.6%) experienced fever, fatigue, and dry cough, while 15 (15.8%) had poor appetite and fatigue, and 11 (11.6%) had a dry cough and no fever.
NA,On CT imaging, early stage patients (n = 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by interlobular septal thickening.
NA,Thirty-four (35.8%) patients were classified in the 'progression stage' based on CT imaging; these patients typically showed lesions in multiple lung segments and lobes (21/34，61.8%), and an uneven increase in ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows(30.5%).
NA,Two patients (2.1%) showed a severe presentation on CT.
NA,These showed diffuse bilateral lung lesions, mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation with cord-like interstitial thickening and air bronchograms, entire lung involvement with a &quot;white lung&quot; presentation, and mild pleural effusion.
NA,Six patients in remission (6.3%), visible lesion absorption, fibrotic lesions.
NA,Based on clinical signs, 71 (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively.
NA,Within the follow-up period, 93 patients recovered and were discharged, including the 53 early stage patients and 34 progression stage patients.
NA,The length of hospitalisation was 7-28 days (mean: 10 ± 3.5 days).
NA,On discharge, lesions were significantly reduced in area and had in many cases completely disappeared, while slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some patients.
NA,One severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the follow-up period and the other severe stage patient died.
NA,The overall mortality rate was 1.05%.
NA,Understanding the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is important for early lesion detection, determining the nature of lesions, and assessing disease severity.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses major challenges for the entire medical care system.
NA,Especially in university institutions as maximum care providers, a higher exposure to potentially infectious patients or actual COVID19 patients is to be expected.
NA,In a short period of time, an operational concept had to be developed regarding the current hygiene recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the leading medical societies and the internal hospital hygiene plan.
NA,Here, patient safety and employee protection are equally important.In cooperation with the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene and the occupational medical service, interventions were defined to develop solutions to minimize the COVID-19 transmission risk for examiners and patients despite limited diagnostic and equipment resources.
NA,For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
NA,After the initial rollout and several &quot;hygiene inspections&quot; only minor improvements to the concept were necessary.
NA,All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.
NA,Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a dynamic process with regular changes in the development and information status, the operational concept is regularly reviewed for validity and adjusted as necessary.
NA,Die SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie stellt das gesamte medizinische Versorgungssystem vor große Herausforderungen.
NA,Gerade in universitären Einrichtungen als Maximalversorger ist eine höhere Exposition zu potenziell infektiösen Patienten oder tatsächlichen COVID-19-Kranken zu erwarten.
NA,Es musste kurzfristig ein Betriebskonzept entwickelt werden, das den aktuellen Hygiene-Empfehlungen des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI), den Empfehlungen der führenden Fachgesellschaften und dem daraus abgeleiteten internen Hygieneplan entsprach.
NA,Hierbei sind die Patientensicherheit und der Mitarbeiterschutz gleichermaßen zu beachten.In Zusammenarbeit mit dem Institut für Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Krankenhaushygiene sowie dem Betriebsärztlichen Dienst wurden Maßnahmen festgelegt, um trotz begrenzter diagnostischer und Ausrüstungsressourcen Lösungen zu erarbeiten, um die COVID-19-Übertragungsgefahr für Untersucher und Patienten zu minimieren.
NA,Hierzu wurde ein Betriebskonzept erarbeitet, das aus verschiedenen Einzelmaßnahmen bestand, wie z.
NA,B. der Reduktion der ambulanten Patientenbehandlung auf Notfälle, lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen und dringliche Nachsorgen, eine Doppeltriage von Patienten sowie die Einführung von Behandlungsteams.Das neue erarbeitete Betriebskonzept konnte erfolgreich innerhalb weniger Tage umgesetzt werden.
NA,Nach ersten Erfahrungen aus dem Realbetrieb und mehreren „Hygienebegehungen“ waren lediglich geringfügige Nachbesserungen des Konzeptes erforderlich.
NA,Alle Maßnahmen wurden schriftlich im klinikinternen Qualitätshandbuch dokumentiert und sind allen Mitarbeitern zugänglich.
NA,Da es sich bei der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie um einen dynamischen Prozess mit regelmäßiger Änderung des Entwicklungs- und Informationsstandes handelt, wird das Betriebskonzept regelmäßig neu auf Gültigkeit überprüft und ggf. angepasst.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic touching thousands of patients all around the world.
NA,Patients supported with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are usually affected by long-standing cardiovascular diseases and subjected to variations of the normal cardiovascular physiology, thus requiring an even closer monitoring during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a drastic reduction of routine clinical activities and a consequent risk of looser connections between LVAD patients and their referring center.
NA,Potential deleterious effects of such a situation can be delayed recognition of LVAD-related complications, misdiagnosis of COVID-19 and impaired social and psychological well-being for patents and families.
NA,As one of the largest LVAD programs worldwide, we designed a sustainable and enforceable telemonitoring algorithm which can be easily adapted to every LVAD center so to maintain optimal quality of care of LVAD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Nowadays, an infectious disease outbreak is considered one of the most destructive effects in the sustainable development process.
NA,The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) as an infectious disease showed that it has undesirable social, environmental, and economic impacts, and leads to serious challenges and threats.
NA,Additionally, investigating the prioritization parameters is of vital importance to reducing the negative impacts of this global crisis.
NA,Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters.
NA,For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters-such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed-and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset.
NA,In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters.
NA,The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one.
NA,Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE.
NA,In addition, the priority of two variables, urban parameter, and relative humidity, were the highest to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19.
NA,Graphene-based materials are intriguing nanomaterials with applications ranging from nanotechnology-related devices to drug delivery systems and biosensing.
NA,Multifunctional graphene platforms were proposed for the detection of several typical biomarkers (i.e., circulating tumor cells, exosomes, circulating nucleic acids, etc.) in liquid biopsy, and numerous methods, including optical, electrochemical, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), etc., have been developed for their detection.
NA,Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides.
NA,Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders.
NA,Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,This review aimed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth summarization of the contribution of graphene-based nanomaterials in liquid biopsy, discussing the remaining challenges and the future trend; moreover, the paper gave the first look at the potentiality of graphene in COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,The phylogenetic clustering of 95 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the first 3 months of the pandemic reveals insights into the early evolution of the virus and gives first indications of how the variants are globally distributed.
NA,Variants might become a challenge in terms of diagnostics, immunology, and effectiveness of drugs.
NA,All available whole genome sequence data from the NCBI database (March 16, 2020) were phylogenetically analyzed, and gene prediction as well as analysis of selected variants were performed.
NA,Antigenic regions and the secondary protein structure were predicted for selected variants.
NA,While some clusters are presenting the same variant with 100% identical bases, other SARS-CoV-2 lineages show a beginning diversification and phylogenetic clustering due to base substitutions and deletions in the genomes.
NA,First molecular epidemiological investigations are possible with the results by adding metadata as travelling history to the presented data.
NA,The advantage of variants in source tracing can be a challenge in terms of virulence, immune response, and immunological memory.
NA,Variants of viruses often show differences in virulence or antigenicity.
NA,This must also be considered in decisions like herd immunity.
NA,Diagnostic methods might not work if the variations or deletions are in target regions for the detection of the pathogen.
NA,One base substitution was detected in a primer binding site.
NA,The Coronavirus pandemic stresses the importance of eHealth techniques to monitor patients at home.
NA,Home monitoring of lung function in asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF) may help to detect deterioration of lung function at an early stage, but the reliability is unclear.
NA,We investigated whether lung function measurements at home were comparable to measurements during clinical visits.
NA,We analysed prospectively collected data of two one-year observational cohort studies in 117 children (36 with CF and 81 with asthma).
NA,All patients performed forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) measurements with a monitor at home.
NA,Paired FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were included if the measurement on the home monitor was performed on the same day as the FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement on the pneumotachometer during a two monthly clinical visit.
NA,Bland-Altman plots and linear mixed model analysis were used.
NA,The mean difference (home measurement was subtracted from clinical measurement) in FEV<sub>1</sub> was 0.18 L in CF (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.27 L; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and 0.12 L in asthma (95%CI 0.05-0.19 L; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
NA,FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements at home were significantly lower than clinically obtained FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements, which has implications for the application of this technique in the daily clinical situation.
NA,Emergency measures to treat patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and contain the outbreak is the main priority in each of our hospitals; however, these measures are likely to result in collateral damage among patients with other acute diseases.
NA,Here, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects acute stroke care through interruptions in the stroke chain of survival.
NA,A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe.
NA,To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region.
NA,Following confinement of the population, our stroke unit activity decreased sharply, with a 25% reduction in admitted cases (mean number of 58 cases every 15 days in previous months to 44 cases in the 15 days after the outbreak, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
NA,Consultations to the telestroke network declined from 25 every 15 days before the outbreak to 7 after the outbreak (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
NA,The increasing trend in the prehospital diagnosis of stroke activated by 911 calls stopped abruptly in the region, regressing to 2019 levels.
NA,The mean number of stroke codes dispatched to hospitals decreased (78% versus 57%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
NA,Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed &gt;30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways.
NA,Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges.
NA,It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.
NA,There is debate as to whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 infection.
NA,We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19.
NA,The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19.
NA,Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa.
NA,Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis.
NA,The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.
NA,According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.
NA,The COVID-19 is a global pandemic.
NA,Its rapid dissemination and serious course require a novel approach to healthcare practices.
NA,Severe disease progression is often associated with the development of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and may require some form of respiratory support, including endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube.
NA,These conditions increase the risk of dysphagia, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia.
NA,The data on the incidence and risks of dysphagia associated with COVID-19 are not yet available.
NA,However, it is assumed that these patients are at high risk, because of respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function.
NA,These findings may exacerbate swallowing deficits.
NA,The aim of this review is to summarize available information on possible mechanisms of postintubation dysphagia in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of postintubation dysphagia in COVID-19 patients are described in this contemporary review.
NA,Melanoma is one of the most common cancers, with an increasing incidence worldwide.
NA,Disease stage represents the most important prognosis factor; therefore, early diagnosis is essential for melanoma patients' survival rates.
NA,Following the outbreak in China, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread all over the world and the majority of dermatological visits have been postponed.
NA,These measures could cause a delay in melanoma diagnosis and management leading to an increase of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.
NA,Herein we propose an alternative model of skin cancer screening and the organization of screening campaigns in order to detect malignant lesions early during this emergency period.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus officially named the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to emergency radiology practice.
NA,The continuity of an effective emergency imaging service for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients is essential, while adhering to best infection control practices.
NA,Under the direction of the Board of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, this general guidance document has been synthesized by collaborative consensus of a group of emergency radiologists.
NA,These recommendations aim to assist radiologists involved in emergency diagnostic imaging to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and continue to add value to patient care in the emergency setting.
NA,The risk of COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PLWH) is largely unknown and there have been very few reported cases in the literature.
NA,We report a case series of five PLWH with COVID-19.
NA,We identified all patients with a diagnosis of HIV who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Chicago Medicine between March 1, 2020, and April 7, 2020.
NA,We retrospectively collected data regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory test results, radiology results, and outcomes associated with COVID-19.
NA,All five PLWH with COVID-19 were African American; 80% (4/5) were cisgender females.
NA,The mean age of patients was 48 years old (range 38-53).
NA,The majority of patients presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
NA,Three patients had diarrhea.
NA,One patient presented with predominantly cardiac symptoms.
NA,All were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 count &gt;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and suppressed HIV viral loads at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis.
NA,All five patients were hospitalized, two required supplemental oxygen, and none required mechanical ventilation.
NA,Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine.
NA,The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2-7).
NA,All patients recovered.
NA,More research is needed to understand the risks of COVID-19 among PLWH and the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19.
NA,To evaluate the imaging features of routine admission chest X-ray in patients referred for novel Coronavirus 2019 infection.
NA,All patients referred to the emergency departments, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated.
NA,Demographic and clinical data were recorded.
NA,Two radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience) reviewed all the X-ray images and evaluated the following findings: interstitial opacities, alveolar opacities (AO), AO associated with consolidation, consolidation and/or pleural effusion.
NA,We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old).
NA,Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications.
NA,A total of 468 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Lung lesions primarily manifested as interstitial opacities (71.7%) and AO opacities (60.5%), more frequently bilateral (64.5%) and with a peripheral predominance (62.5%).
NA,Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral.
NA,Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones.
NA,Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations.
NA,The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities.
NA,Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting.
NA,Theories of aging posit that older adult age is associated with less negative emotions, but few studies have examined age differences at times of novel challenges.
NA,As COVID-19 spread in the United States, this study therefore aimed to examine age differences in risk perceptions, anxiety and depression.
NA,In March 2020, a nationally representative address-based sample of 6666 US adults assessed their perceived risk of getting COVID-19, dying if getting it, getting quarantined, losing their job (if currently working), and running out of money.
NA,They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression.
NA,Demographic variables and pre-crisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported.
NA,In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety.
NA,Findings held after additionally controlling for pre-crisis reports of depression diagnosis.
NA,With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, US adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic.
NA,Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,Implications for risk communication and mental health interventions are discussed.
NA,We read with interest the article by Lorenzo et al On Conjunctivitis and COVID-19: a meta analysis.
NA,We appreciate the article's suggestions on protection in ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment, but believe that the data and conclusions in meta-analysis need further study.

NA,The present-day world is severely suffering from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The lack of prescribed drugs for the deadly virus has stressed the likely need to identify novel inhibitors to alleviate and stop the pandemic.
NA,In the present high throughput virtual screening study, we used in silico techniques like receptor-ligand docking, Molecular dynamic (MD), and ADME properties to screen natural compounds.
NA,It has been documented that many natural compounds display antiviral activities, including anti-SARS-CoV effect.
NA,The present study deals with compounds of Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database with known biological activity that probably impedes the activity of six essential enzymes of the virus.
NA,Promising drug-like compounds were identified, demonstrating better docking score and binding energy for each druggable targets.
NA,After an extensive screening analysis, three novel multi-target natural compounds were predicted to subdue the activity of three/more major drug targets simultaneously.
NA,Concerning the utility of natural compounds in the formulation of many therapies, we propose these compounds as excellent lead candidates for the development of therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a major surge in needed diagnostic capacity.
NA,In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.
NA,To determine the analytical performance of the ID NOW assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Residual NP samples collected in viral transport media were tested by the ID NOW platform in two independent laboratories.
NA,Results were compared to either the CDC or New York EUA assays, which served as reference methods.
NA,Overall agreement of ID NOW was 78.7%.
NA,Sensitivity was 71.7% and specificity was 100%.
NA,Notably, all false-negative results correlated to those samples that were weakly positive.
NA,ID NOW performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has reduced sensitivity for weakly positive samples.
NA,This sensitivity, among other concerns, should be taken into consideration when using this test for patients with a low suspicion for COVID-19 disease.
NA,The SARS-Cov-2 infection disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed at risk the kidney transplant (KT) population, particularly the elderly recipients.
NA,From March-12<sup>th</sup> until April-4<sup>th</sup> 2020, we diagnosed COVID-19 in 16 of our 324 KT patients aged ≥65 years old (4.9%).
NA,Many of them had had contact with healthcare facilities in the month prior to infection.
NA,Median time of symptom onset to admission was 7 days.
NA,All presented with fever and all but one with pneumonia.
NA,Up to 33% showed renal graft dysfunction.
NA,At infection diagnosis, mTOR inhibitors or mycophenolate were withdrawn.
NA,Tacrolimus was withdrawn in 70%.
NA,The main treatment combination was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
NA,A subset of patients was treated with anti-retroviral and tocilizumab.
NA,Short-term fatality rate was 50% at a median time since admission of 3 days.
NA,Those who died were more frequently obese, frail and had underlying heart disease.
NA,Although a higher respiratory rate was observed at admission in nonsurvivors, symptoms at presentation were similar between both groups.
NA,Patients who died were more anemic, lymphopenic and showed higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 at their first tests.
NA,COVID-19 is frequent among the elderly KT population and associates a very early and high mortality rate.
NA,Infection of novel Coronavirus has been declared pandemic by the WHO and now is a world public health crisis.
NA,Laboratory activity becames essential for the timely diagnosis.
NA,Few parameters, such Lymphocytes count, SaO2 and CRP serum level can be used to assess the severity of COVID-19 in emergency room.
NA,Here, we describe two mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases.
NA,One was imported from Wuhan, and the other was locally transmitted in Japan without recent travel to China.
NA,In both cases, lower respiratory tract symptoms were observed first, and high fever progressed in about one week.
NA,The laboratory findings revealed normal WBC and CRP despite apparent lung infiltrations, and typical observations on CT imaging were important diagnostic clues.
NA,In the domestic endemic situation, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical course, and laboratory and radiological findings was required for diagnosis.
NA,The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed formidable challenges for clinical laboratories seeking reliable laboratory diagnostic confirmation.
NA,The swift advance of the crisis in the United States has led to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) facilitating the availability of molecular diagnostic assays without the more rigorous examination to which tests are normally subjected prior to FDA approval.
NA,Our laboratory currently uses two real time RT-PCR platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Both platforms demonstrate comparable performance; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 hours and 45 minutes, respectively.
NA,In search for a platform with shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 minutes.
NA,We present here the results of comparisons between Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media and comparisons between Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media for Cepheid and dry nasal swabs for Abbott ID NOW.
NA,Regardless of method of collection and sample type, Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 had negative results in a third of the samples that tested positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress when using nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media and 45% when using dry nasal swabs.
NA,COVID-19 outcomes in people with rheumatic diseases remain poorly understood.
NA,The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease.
NA,Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020.
NA,Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of hospitalisation.
NA,Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed.
NA,A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included.
NA,Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46%) and 55 (9%) died.
NA,In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose ≥10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.96).
NA,Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively).
NA,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06).
NA,Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed.
NA,We found that glucocorticoid exposure of ≥10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease.
NA,Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak is on the world.
NA,While many countries have imposed general lockdown, emergency services are continuing.
NA,Healthcare professionals have been infected with the virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS), which spreads by close contact and aerosols.
NA,The anesthesiologist is particularly vulnerable to aerosols while performing intubation and other airway related procedures.
NA,Regional anesthesia (RA) minimizes the need for airway manipulation and the risks of cross infection to other patients, and the healthcare personnel.
NA,In this context, for prioritizing RA over general anesthesia, wherever possible, a structured algorithmic approach is outlined.
NA,The role of percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (oxygen saturation), blood pressure and early use of point-of-care ultrasound in differential diagnosis and specific management is detailed.
NA,The perioperative anesthetic implications of multisystem manifestations of COVID-19, anesthetic management options, the scope of RA and considerations for its safe conduct in operating rooms is described.
NA,An outline for safe and rapid training of healthcare personnel, with an Entrustable Professional Activity framework for ascertaining the practice readiness among trained residents for RA in COVID-19, is suggested.
NA,These are the authors' experiences gained from the current pandemic and similar SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and influenza outbreaks in recent past faced by our authors in Singapore, India, Hong Kong and Canada.
NA,The first case of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported in China on 17 November 2019.
NA,By the end of March 2020, the rapid global spread of infection affected over 1 million people.
NA,Italy is one of the countries most impacted, with over 100,000 positive cases identified.
NA,The first detected cases were reported on 21 February 2020 in two Italian towns: Vo' Euganeo in the Province of Padua, Veneto region, and Codogno, in the Province of Lodi, Lombardy.
NA,In the next weeks the epidemic spread quickly across the country but mainly in the north of Italy.
NA,The two regions: Veneto and Lombardy, implemented different strategies to control the viral spread.
NA,In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated.
NA,We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact.
NA,We strongly recommend that decision-makers:ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts;maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services;rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples;equip the population with protective masks.
NA,The safety of minimally invasive procedures during COVID pandemic remains hotly debated, especially in a country, like Italy, where minimally invasive techniques have progressively and pervasively entered clinical practice, in both the hepatobiliary and pancreatic community.
NA,A nationwide snapshot of the management of HPB minimally invasive surgery activity during COVID-19 pandemic is provided: a survey was developed and conducted within AICEP (Italian Association of HepatoBilioPancreatic Surgeons) with the final aim of conveying the experience, knowledge, and opinions into a unitary report enabling more efficient crisis management.
NA,Results from the survey (81 respondents) show that, in Italian hospitals, minimally invasive surgery maintains its role despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with the registered reduction of cases being proportional to the overall reduction of the HPB surgical activity.
NA,Respondents agree that the switch from minimally invasive to open technique can be considered as a valid option for cases with a high technical complexity.
NA,Several issues merit specific attention: screening for virus positivity should be universally performed; only expert surgical teams should operate on positive patients and specific technical measures to lower the biological risk of contamination during surgery must be followed.
NA,Future studies specifically designed to establish the true risks in minimally invasive surgery are suggested.
NA,Furthermore, a standard and univocal process of prioritization of patients from Regional Healthcare Systems is advisable.
NA,The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly, from December to the end of March, to 185 countries, and there have been over 3,000,000 cases identified and over 200,000 deaths.
NA,For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
NA,In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection.
NA,No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients.
NA,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series.
NA,Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19.
NA,Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach.
NA,Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients.
NA,We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points• Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.
NA,• No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.
NA,• A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.
NA,• Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which recently has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having killed almost 250,000 people worldwide as of May 4th 2020.
NA,Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is now evident that it may also affect the cardiovascular system in multiple ways.
NA,The current paper is a review of the most recent literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated main cardiovascular clinical manifestations.
NA,Cardiovascular disease represents a prevalent underlying comorbidity associated with increased mortality rates among COVID-19 affected individuals.
NA,In addition, various cardiovascular manifestations have been linked to the viral insult, including among others acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, acute heart failure, cardiac injury, arrhythmias and acute pulmonary embolism.
NA,Further studies are required in order to establish the complicated association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects on the cardiovascular system.
NA,Our knowledge regarding diagnostic approaches, therapeutic management and preventive measures is constantly enriched throughout an abundance of ongoing research in the respective fields.
NA,From first cases reported on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei-China, SARS-CoV2 has spread worldwide and finally the World Health Organization declared the pandemic status.
NA,We summarize what makes SARS-CoV2 different from previous highly pathogenic coronaviruses and why it is so contagious, with focus on its clinical presentation and diagnosis, which is mandatory to start the appropriate management and reduce the transmission.
NA,As far as infection pathophysiology is still not completely clarified, this review focuses also on the cardiovascular (CV) implication of COVID-19 and the capability of this virus to cause direct myocardial injury, myocarditis and other CV manifestations.
NA,Furthermore, we highlight the relationship between the virus, enzyme ACE2 and ACE inhibitors.
NA,Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
NA,Aim of this review is then to summarize what is actually known about the SARS-CoV2 and its cardiovascular implications.
NA,The ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging global public health system.
NA,Sex-differences in infectious diseases are a common but neglected problem.
NA,We used the national surveillance database of COVID-19 in mainland China to compared gender differences in attack rate (AR), proportion of severe and critical cases (PSCC) and case fatality rate (CFR) in relation to age, affected province, and onset-to-diagnosis interval.
NA,The overall AR was significantly higher in female population than in males (63.9 versus 60.5 per million persons; P ˂ .001).
NA,By contrast, PSCC and CFR were significantly lower among female patients (16.9% and 4.0%) than among males (19.5% and 7.2%), with ORs of 0.87 and 0.57, respectively (both P ˂ .001).
NA,The female-to-male differences were age-dependent, which were significant among people aged 50-69 years for AR, and in the patients of 30-years or older for both PSCC and CFR (all P ≤ .001).
NA,The AR, PSCC and CFR varied greatly from province to province.
NA,However, female-to-male differences in AR, PSCC and CFR were significant in the epicenter, Hubei province, where 82.2% confirmed cases and 97.4% deaths occurred.
NA,After adjusting for age, affected province and onset-to-diagnosis interval, the female-to-male difference in AR, PSCC and CFR remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analyses.
NA,We elucidate an age-dependent gender dimorphism for COVID-19, in which the females have higher susceptibility but lower severity and fatality.
NA,Further epidemiological and biological investigations are required to better understand the sex-specific differences for effective interventions.
NA,We describe a patient presenting with chest discomfort, anterolateral ST elevation, and developing acute cardiogenic shock secondary to SARS-COV-2infection-patient zero presenting to our institution's cardiac catheterization laboratory.
NA,The emergent presentation with limited clinical information led to exposure of personnel.
NA,The diagnosis was complicated by two negative tests for SARS-COV-2, and high-clinical suspicion from the patient's occupational history led to additional testing in order to confirm the diagnosis.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly across the USA, causing extensive morbidity and mortality, particularly in the African American community.
NA,Autopsy can considerably contribute to our understanding of many disease processes and could provide crucial information to guide management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19.
NA,Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44-78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans.
NA,Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin.
NA,Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections.
NA,Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death.
NA,Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated.
NA,Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis.
NA,There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms.
NA,We identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic.
NA,Management of these patients should include treatment to target these pathological mechanisms.
NA,None.
NA,Single-use filtering face respirators (FFRs) are critical pieces of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers treating patients with suspected upper respiratory tract pathogens.
NA,Experiences during pandemics in the 2000s, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-2-CoV2, have highlighted concerns over the pressures that sustained respiratory virus pandemics may have on supplies of FFRs globally.
NA,Decontamination of FFRs has been posited as one solution to support the re-use of FFRs with a growing body of literature over the last 10+ years beginning to examine both the efficacy of disinfection of contaminated FFRs but also the impact of the decontamination process on the FFR's performance.
NA,Physical and chemical methods of decontamination have been tested for treatment of FFRs with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, sterilization by steam, ethylene oxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating the most promising results thus far.
NA,Many of these methods utilize existing equipment that may already be available in hospitals and could be re-purposed for FFR decontamination.
NA,Importantly, some methods may also be replicated on household equipment, broadening the utility of FFR decontamination across a range of healthcare settings.
NA,Utilizing techniques to experimentally contaminate FFRs with a range of microorganisms, most decontamination methods appear to reduce the risk of the mask as a source of infection to the wearer and others to negligible levels.
NA,The performance of the filter, especially the efficiency of particle penetration following treatment, varied greatly depending on the processing method as well as the model of the filter itself, however.
NA,Urgent regulatory body-supported research is required to endorse the routine decontamination of FFRs.
NA,In emergency settings, these methods should nevertheless be carefully considered as one strategy to address potential shortfalls in supplies of FFRs for healthcare workers.
NA,The 2019 novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths, with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide.
NA,The present study followed computational approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by its interactions with the human leukocyte antigen alleles.
NA,We identified 24 peptide stretches on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that are well conserved among the reported strains.
NA,The S protein structure further validated the presence of predicted peptides on the surface, of which 20 are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable epitope binding efficiency.
NA,The work could be useful for understanding the immunodominant regions in the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially help in designing some peptide-based diagnostics.
NA,Also, identified T-cell epitopes might be considered for incorporation in vaccine designs.
NA,SARS-CoV2 is a source of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19), this is considered as a fatal disease to universal communal health apprehension.
NA,This rapid pathogenic virus plays an important role in finding the pathogenic virus, treatment and prevention of pandemics.
NA,Virus can present everywhere in Global village.
NA,As it is virus it can extend easily and cause severe illness to the society.
