31986261,An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
31986261,Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.
31986261,No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.
31986261,In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.
31986261,Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.
31986261,From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020.
31986261,Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.
31986261,Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.
31986261,None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.
31986261,Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure.
31986261,They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset.
31986261,They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.
31986261,Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.
31986261,The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
31986261,Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
31986261,Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

31986264,A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
31986264,We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
31986264,All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.
31986264,We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.
31986264,Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.
31986264,Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.
31986264,Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.
31986264,By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.
31986264,Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).
31986264,Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
31986264,One family cluster was found.
31986264,Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).
31986264,Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.
31986264,All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.
31986264,Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.
31986264,Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.
31986264,The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.
31986264,Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

31991628,A cluster of pneumonia cases linked to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported by China in late December 2019.
31991628,Reported case incidence has now reached the hundreds, but this is likely an underestimate.
31991628,As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, we estimate the cumulative incidence in China at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057).
31991628,The most plausible number of infections is in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.
31994738,There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global public health threat.
31994738,In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus.
31994738,A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS-like coronavirus).
31994738,Fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses.
31994738,The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein.
31994738,From these results, the new 2019-nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from bats after mutation conferring ability to infect humans.
31995857,The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.
31995857,We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.
31995857,We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.
31995857,We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.
31995857,In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.
31995857,Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.
31995857,The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.
31995857,The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.
31995857,In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.
31995857,With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).
31995857,On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.
31995857,Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.
31995857,Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

32007143,In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.
32007143,We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
32007143,In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.
32007143,Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.
32007143,Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.
32007143,Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.
32007143,The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.
32007143,Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).
32007143,According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
32007143,The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32007143,In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.
32007143,Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

32015508,Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health<sup>1-3</sup>.
32015508,Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.
32015508,A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
32015508,As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019.
32015508,Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.
32015508,Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.
32015508,Metagenomic RNA sequencing<sup>4</sup> of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV').
32015508,Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China<sup>5</sup>.
32015508,This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.
32020915,The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases increasing every day.
32020915,With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32020915,Herein, we present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.
32023775,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently recognized as a public health emergency of global concern.
32023775,We reviewed the currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control measures to be implemented by public health authorities.
32023775,Some of the epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified.
32023775,However, there remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing guidance to public health authorities on control measures.
32023775,Additional studies incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases would be valuable.
32027035,To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed.
32027035,Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed.
32027035,On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts.
32027035,We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains.
32027035,The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 × 10<sup>-3</sup> to 1.8266 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year.
32027035,On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV transmission in real-time.
32027812,This is the first epidemiological report of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory disease infections reported in Australia at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 1 February 2020.
32027812,It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week 26 January to 1 February 2020 and in the previous week (19 to 25 January 2020), the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV infection.
32029004,In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named &quot;2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020.
32029004,For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual.
32029004,For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed.
32029004,Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
32029004,This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV.
32029004,Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections.
32029004,This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.
32030925,In December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China.
32030925,We report the epidemiological and clinical features of the first patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia imported into Korea from Wuhan.
32030925,This report suggests that in the early phase of 2019-nCoV pneumonia, chest radiography would miss patients with pneumonia and highlights taking travel history is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of 2019-nCoV cases.
32031570,In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China.
32031570,The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
32031570,To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.
32031570,Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.
32031570,Documented NCIP.
32031570,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32031570,Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared.
32031570,Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.
32031570,Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.
32031570,Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]).
32031570,Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]).
32031570,Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%).
32031570,Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients.
32031570,Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]).
32031570,Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]).
32031570,The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.
32031570,Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]).
32031570,Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).
32031570,As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized.
32031570,Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).
32031570,In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.
32035431,In about 20 days since the diagnosis of the first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Korea on January 20, 2020, 28 cases have been confirmed.
32035431,Fifteen patients (53.6%) of them were male and median age of was 42 years (range, 20-73).
32035431,Of the confirmed cases, 16, 9, and 3 were index (57.2%), first-generation (32.1%), and second-generation (10.7%) cases, respectively.
32035431,All first-generation and second-generation patients were family members or intimate acquaintances of the index cases with close contacts.
32035431,Fifteen among 16 index patients had entered Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020 while 1 patient had entered Korea on January 31, 2020.
32035431,The average incubation period was 3.9 days (median, 3.0), and the reproduction number was estimated as 0.48.
32035431,Three of the confirmed patients were asymptomatic when they were diagnosed.
32035431,Epidemiological indicators will be revised with the availability of additional data in the future.
32035431,Sharing epidemiological information among researchers worldwide is essential for efficient preparation and response in tackling this new infectious disease.
32040985,The novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) continues to spread throughout the country, and the prevention and control of the epidemic has entered a critical period.
32040985,However, southern cities with severe outbreaks are about to enter the seasonal influenza season.
32040985,We should strengthen the epidemiological investigation, optimize the laboratory testing strategy, take effective measures, strengthen the prevention and control of influenza epidemic, and minimize the interference to the new coronavirus epidemic.
32040985,新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情在全国持续蔓延，疫情防控进入关键时期。
32040985,然而，目前疫情严重的南方城市即将进入季节性流感高发季节。
32040985,要加强流行病学调查，优化实验室检测策略，采取有效措施，加大流感疫情防控力度，最大限度减少对新型冠状病毒疫情防控的干扰。.
32044814,A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020.
32044814,This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.
32044814,Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.
32044814,None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
32044814,Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache.
32044814,Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.
32044814,Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows.
32044814,Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.
32044814,Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions.
32044814,Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits.
32044814,Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis.
32044814,The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.
32044814,The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging.
32044814,Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.
32046137,Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries.
32046137,Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity.
32046137,A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures.
32046137,The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23).
32046137,Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value.
32046137,It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained.
32046137,Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value.
32046137,With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.
32048163,The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries.
32048163,Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China.
32048163,All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32048163,The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count.
32048163,The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity.
32048163,ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury.
32048163,Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity.
32048163,Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury.
32048163,Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.
32048560,The global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high.
32048560,In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus.
32048560,A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank.
32048560,We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients.
32048560,The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the <i>Rhinolophus</i> bat family.
32048560,In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2019.
32048560,These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to <i>Betacoronavirus</i>.
32048560,Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of <i>Betacoronavirus</i> among animals and <i>Rhinolophus</i> of the bat family.
32048815,To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32048815,Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
32048815,The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues.
32048815,The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS.
32048815,It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility.
32048815,Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.
32050080,This is the second epidemiological report for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), previously known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 8 February 2020.
32050080,It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week ending 19:00 AEDT 8 February 2020, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread of the COVID-19 infection.
32050635,In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People's Republic of China.
32050635,Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV.
32050635,The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents.
32050635,Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human.
32050635,In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations.
32050635,Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic.
32050635,In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants.
32050635,Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.
32051073,Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China.
32051073,The epidemic has been spreading to other areas of the country and abroad.
32051073,A few cases have progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function failure.
32051073,The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to 2019-nCoV.
32051073,A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age, including 5 cases in Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in China so far.
32051073,In order to further standardize and enhance the clinical management of 2019-nCoV infection in children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number of severe cases, we have formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation according to the recent information at home and abroad.
32057210,During a short period of time, the outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, named Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), was first reported in China, spreading to 24 countries and regions rapidly.
32057210,The number of confirmed cases and deaths continued to rise.
32057210,World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreaks of the novel coronavirus have constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32057210,Efficient infection control can prevent the virus from further spreading, which makes the epidemic situation under control.
32057210,Due to the specialty of oral healthcare settings, the risk of cross infection is severe among patients and oral healthcare practitioners.
32057210,It's more urgent to implement strict and efficient infection control protocols.
32057210,This paper, based on existing guidelines and published researches pertinent to dental infection-control principles and practices, mainly discusses epidemiological characteristics of NCP and the features of nosocomial infection in oral healthcare settings, and furthermore provides recommendations on patient's evaluation, and infection control protocols in department of stomatology under current circumstance..

32057211,Through literature review and group discussion, Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association formulated an update on the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32057211,The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with pangolins as a potential animal host.
32057211,Currently the main source of infection is NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious.
32057211,The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact.
32057211,People are all generally susceptible to the virus.
32057211,The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak.
32057211,Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases.
32057211,The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death.
32057211,Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.
32057211,中华预防医学会新型冠状病毒肺炎防控专家组在文献回顾和专家研讨基础上，形成了对新型冠状病毒肺炎流行病学特征的最新认识。
32057211,病毒最初的来源为武汉市华南海鲜市场，穿山甲为潜在的动物宿主。

32064855,此次聚集性暴发，4例患者始终无症状，但PCR和IgM抗体检测阳性，说明无症状者可能是此次控制此次疫情的关键节点，对于咽拭子核酸检测阴性但明确有毛玻璃样肺部病变的患者进行特异性IgM抗体筛查对病例早发现早隔离至关重要。.
32065057,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world.
32065057,It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease.
32065057,Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs.
32065057,However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines.
32065057,Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested.
32065057,We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus.
32065057,We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route.
32065057,We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.
32065057,Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.
32067043,An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in China.
32067043,It is unclear if the infectivity exists during the incubation period, although a person-to-person transmission has been reported in previous studies.
32067043,We report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of four patients in Shanghai, of which one was 88 years old man with moving difficulties and was only exposed to his asymptomatic family members who developed symptoms later.
32067043,The epidemiological evidence has shown a potential transmission of the 2019-nCoV during the incubation period.
32072569,There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 17 other countries.
32072569,Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency.
32072569,At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities.
32072569,This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from laboratories supporting the investigation.
32072569,This paper aggregates and consolidates the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government documents.
32072569,In addition, by fitting the number of infections with a single-term exponential model, we report that the infection is spreading at an exponential rate, with a doubling period of 1.8 days.
32074480,This is the third epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), previously known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), from the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 15 February 2020.
32074480,It includes data on the COVID-19 Australian cases, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread.
32078069,An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019.
32078069,With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred.
32078069,At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020.
32078069,At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO.
32078069,It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought.
32078069,Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control.
32078069,More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina.
32078069,According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.
32079150,The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus.
32079150,Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections.
32079150,Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution.
32079150,The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated.
32079150,Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days.
32079150,The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.
32080990,Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is found to cause a large outbreak started from Wuhan since December 2019 in China and SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with epidemiological linkage to China in 25 countries until now.
32080990,We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the oropharyngeal sample obtained from the patient with the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea.
32080990,Cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vero cell cultures were confluent 3 days after the first blind passage of the sample.
32080990,Coronavirus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy.
32080990,Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 reported from Wuhan.
32080991,As of February 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in China in December 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world.
32080991,With the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing, information on the epidemiologic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated.
32080991,However, data on viral load kinetics in confirmed cases are lacking.
32080991,Here, we present the viral load kinetics of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in Korea in whom distinct viral load kinetics are shown.
32080991,This report suggests that viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV.
32083985,In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread across China and beyond.
32083985,On February 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32083985,Since most COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT imaging patterns, radiological examinations have become vital in early diagnosis and assessment of disease course.
32083985,To date, CT findings have been recommended as major evidence for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China.
32083985,This review focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while highlighting the role of chest CT in prevention and disease control. <i>A full translation of this article in Chinese is available.</i>
32084676,Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is currently raging in China.
32084676,It has been proven that NCP can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients.
32084676,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, now it is a difficult task that with the premise of how to maximize the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, we can provide the highest quality medical services to ensure the orderly development of previous clinical work.
32084676,Referring to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for NCP (Trial Version 4 and 5)&quot; and combining the actual practice situation in our hospital with the &quot;Summary of New Coronavirus Files of Shanghai Renji Hospital&quot;, we summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the NCP epidemiology, meanwhile under such situation aiming the procedure of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, we share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32084676,More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments.
32084676,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32084676,The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
32084676,(2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of NCP to patients and doctors.
32084676,Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.).
32084676,If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed NCP, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended.
32084676,(3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed NCP should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under-5 Pa) must be separated.
32084676,All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.
32084676,(4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with NCP must be protected by three-level.
32084676,After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.
32084676,We hope our &quot;Renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues.
32084676,新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）目前正在我国肆虐。
32084676,已经证实，新冠肺炎存在明显的院内感染现象，给外科医护人员和住院患者造成严重威胁。
32084676,虽然结直肠外科并不是此次抗击疫情的一线学科，但在特殊的形式下，如何最大限度地在保护患者、家属、医务工作者自身的健康以及病区和医院医疗安全的前提下，为患者提供最优质的医疗服务，保证以往临床工作的有序开展，是当下的艰巨任务。
32084676,笔者参照《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第四版)》和《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第五版)》，结合本院《上海仁济医院新型冠状病毒文件汇总》的实际工作情况，总结了新冠肺炎疫情防控形势下，如何开展结直肠外科临床工作，分享了如何在疫情防控情况下，针对结直肠肿瘤急诊患者的诊疗流程、对结直肠肿瘤的诊断和准备择期入院手术结直肠癌患者的处理、病房的防护、围手术期的管理等，更重要的是详细介绍了疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术及围手术期的管理，包括医务人员及手术室、手术器械的防控措施。
32084676,其中特别强调的包括：（1）多学科诊疗模式(MDT)应贯穿于结直肠肿瘤整个诊疗过程，MDT成员中，除常规相科室外，呼吸科和感染科也需列入。（
32084676,2）肠镜检查有可能导致患者交叉感染，对操作人员和护理人员也存在较大风险，故仅优先对于可能危及生命的急诊患者（出血、梗阻、消化道异物等）进行；若疑似新冠肺炎患者，不采取内镜下减压措施，直接拟定急诊手术治疗方案。（
32084676,3）疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者应放置于隔离病室，配备单独医疗器具，在指定的独立负压（-5 Pa以下）手术间完成手术；围手术期伤口换药等使用过所有一次性物品、体液、粪便等，均按医疗废物规范进行处置。（
32084676,4）参加疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术的医护人员应实施三级防护，术后应隔离进行&quot;医学观察&quot;14 d。
32084676,希望能对同道有所助益。.
32086938,To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China.
32086938,Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19.
32086938,Comparisons between the viruses were made.
32086938,Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
32086938,Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.
32086938,Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.
32086938,The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.
32086938,We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.
32086938,Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.
32088598,The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in Wuhan, China.
32088598,Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020.
32088598,Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial.
32088598,Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals.
32088598,Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable.
32088598,To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures.
32088598,According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
32088598,Seafood tanks, air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from various sources.
32088598,The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited.
32091395,Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response.
32091395,Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015).
32091395,Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters.
32091395,Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people.
32091395,Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed.
32091395,Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.
32091395,These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.
32092296,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.
32092296,Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths.
32092296,Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea.
32092296,A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes.
32092296,The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP.
32092296,Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP.
32092296,Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members.
32092748,Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients, and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible effectiveness of various interventions.
32092748,This issue has rapidly reviewed and published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies.
32092748,As an academic journal, we will continue to quickly and transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.
32098019,To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases.
32098019,However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk.
32098019,First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed.
32098019,Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed.
32098019,Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests.
32098019,In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems.
32098019,Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.
32098289,The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government.
32098289,Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic's epicenter.
32098289,Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China.
32098289,Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports.
32098289,Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases.
32098289,Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang.
32098289,Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65-81 cases (upper bounds: 169-507) in Guangdong and an additional 44-354 (upper bounds: 141-875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020.
32098289,In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.
32098422,After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections.
32098422,Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32098422,This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19).
32098422,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security.
32098422,There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses.
32098422,The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.
32098616,This is the fourth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 22 February 2020.
32098616,It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
32102279,The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China.
32102279,Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic.
32102279,From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario.
32102279,The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days.
32102279,Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day.
32102279,As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.
32105049,Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were the only coronaviruses known to infect humans.
32105049,Followingthe SARS outbreak, 5 additional coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel coronavirus COVID-19, believed tohave originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32105049,SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are associated with highmortality.
32105049,In this review, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of the recently discovered COVID-19 are reviewed, with a focus onbest practices and the public health implications.
32105680,Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32105680,Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy.
32105680,Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death.
32105680,Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset.
32105680,Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2-14 days).
32105680,Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness.
32105680,Children have been rarely reported.
32105680,Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54-73%).
32105680,Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea.
32105680,Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
32105680,Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients.
32105680,Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate.
32105680,In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults.
32105680,Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases.
32105680,All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.
32105680,Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse.
32105680,For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%.
32105680,Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients.
32105680,Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women.
32105680,Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion.
32105680,Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm.
32105680,For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died.
32105680,Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm.
32105680,No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome.
32105680,Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
32105680,Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring.
32105680,Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations.
32105680,Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly.
32105680,Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).
32110742,The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32110742,While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China.
32110742,The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day.
32110742,The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated.
32110742,We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei.
32110742,We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China.
32110742,Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.
32110742,Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409-7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128-1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.
32110742,Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588-13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.
32110742,Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th).
32110742,We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces.
32110742,Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.
32112072,We first described the 2019 novel coronavirus infection in 10 children occurring in areas other than Wuhan.
32112072,The coronavirus diseases in children are usually mild and epidemiological exposure is a key clue to recognize pediatric case.
32112072,Prolonged virus shedding is observed in respiratory tract and feces at the convalescent stage.
32112886,Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing.
32112886,We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.
32112886,We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals.
32112886,The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained.
32112886,Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.
32112886,By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service.
32112886,Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively.
32112886,The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male.
32112886,192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history.
32112886,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%).
32112886,The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days.
32112886,As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
32112886,On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing.
32112886,Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate.
32112886,The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

32113196,<b>Objective:</b> To study the early dynamics of the epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China from 15 to 31 January, 2020, and estimate the corresponding epidemiological parameters (incubation period, generation interval and basic reproduction number) of the epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> By means of Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported COVID-19 cases.
32113196,Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal distribution.
32113196,Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. <b>Results:</b> Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower.
32113196,The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%<i>CI</i>: 4.31-5.69) days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%<i>CI</i>: 5.20-6.91) days.
32113196,The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%<i>CI</i>: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%<i>CI</i>: 2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%<i>CI</i>: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day longer than that of incubation period.
32113196,The relatively high basic reproduction number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would be lower afterwards. <b>目的：</b> 研究截至2020年1月31日新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的早期流行动态，估计该疫情的基本再生数（<i>R(0)</i>）、潜伏期和世代间隔等流行病学参数。

32113704,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.
32113704,Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19.
32113704,Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments.
32113704,Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak.
32113704,Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.
32113704,In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.
32114193,An ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus has recently emerged in China.
32114193,Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 19 suspect cases.
32114193,We compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid amplification test results from different samples including oropharyngeal swab, blood, urine and stool with 3 different fluorescent RT-PCR kits.
32114193,Nine out of the 19 patients had 2019-nCoV infection detected using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples.
32114193,None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples.
32114193,These three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients.
32114193,Therefore, it is possible that infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only.
32114193,It might be better to make a diagnosis combining the computed tomography scans and nucleic acid detection.
32114755,Controversy remains over whether the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) virus may have infectivity during the incubation period before the onset of symptoms.
32114755,The author had the opportunity to examine the infectivity of COVID-19 during the incubation period by conducting an epidemiological survey on a confirmed patient who had visited Jeju Island during the incubation period.

32124990,There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a worldwide public health threat.
32124990,As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention.
32124990,The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe.
32124990,In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY.
32124990,An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China.
32124990,Overall, at the outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin containment activities.

32133832,<b>Editor office’s response for Ahead of Print article withdrawn</b> The article “Potential false-positive rate among the ‘asymptomatic infected individuals’ in close contacts of COVID-19 patients” was under strong discussion after pre-published.
32133832,Questions from the readers mainly focused on the article’s results and conclusions were depended on theoretical deduction, but not the field epidemiology data and further researches were needed to prove the current theory.
32133832,Based on previous discussions, the article was decided to be offline by the editorial board from the pre-publish lists.<b>Objective:</b> As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying out in many parts of China.
32133832,However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now.
32133832,But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. <b>Methods:</b> Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present.
32133832,The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. <b>Results:</b> When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%.
32133832,The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives. <b>目的：</b> 随着新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控工作不断深入，很多地区开展了对病例的密切接触者的核酸检测主动筛查工作，但是该措施阳性结果中假阳性比例尚未见报道。
32133832,搞清此问题对科学防控疫情具有一定参考价值。
32133832,<b>方法：</b> 基于目前能够获得的信息，估计相关指标的点值和合理变动范围，推演主动筛查措施阳性结果中假阳性比例，单因素和多因素概率敏感性分析探讨结果的稳健性。
32133832,<b>结果：</b> 当密切接触者的感染率和报告的灵敏度和特异度均取点估计值时，主动筛查措施阳性预测值仅为19.67%，相反，阳性结果中假阳性比例为80.33%。
32133832,多因素概率敏感性分析结果支持本研究的基准结果，阳性结果中假阳性比例&gt;47%的可能性为75%。
32133832,<b>结论：</b> 在新型冠状病毒肺炎病例的密切接触者中，核酸检测主动筛查发现的&quot;无症状感染者&quot;可能有近一半，甚至更多为假阳性者。.
32133833,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the principles of differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients during the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing one case of lymphoma who presented pulmonary ground-glass opacities (GGO) after courses of chemotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records.
32133833,Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected.
32133833,Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. <b>Results:</b> Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative.
32133833,One case was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen.
32133833,His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes.
32133833,This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without fever and other respiratory symptoms.
32133833,Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. <b>Conclusions:</b> The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients.
32133833,The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration.
32133833,The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients.
32133833,Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated if infectious disease is considered. <b>目的：</b> 结合化疗后出现肺内磨玻璃影的淋巴瘤患者的临床特征，分析当前新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情期间肿瘤患者出现肺内浸润的鉴别诊断和临床处理思路。
32133833,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析2020年2月13日至2月28日就诊于中国医学科学院肿瘤医院内科的139例患者的基线人口学特征和临床病理资料，分析患者的临床表现、流行病学史、实验室检查和胸部CT扫描影像学资料，在Pubmed、Embase、CNKI等数据库中检索相关文献中肿瘤患者肺部浸润的影像学资料。
32133833,<b>结果：</b> 在139例行化疗前胸部CT检查的患者中，7例（5.0%）患者提示肺内新发浸润性病灶，其中5例（3.6%）以肺内磨玻璃影为主要表现，3例行新型冠状病毒核酸检测均为阴性。
32133833,其中1例为老年男性，诊断为淋巴瘤，CHOP方案（环磷酰胺+多柔比星+长春新碱+强的松）化疗后，无发热和呼吸道症状，血常规示淋巴细胞减少，胸部CT示双肺多发磨玻璃密度影，否认COVID-19流行病学史，经核酸检测排除COVID-19，诊断为病毒性肺炎，给予经验性抗感染治疗。
32133833,<b>结论：</b> 在COVID-19疫情期间，肿瘤患者新发以磨玻璃影为主的肺内浸润时，应结合流行病学史、临床症状、CT表现、实验室检查结果等综合判断，适当放宽新型冠状病毒核酸检测范围，考虑感染性疾病时应在启动经验性抗感染治疗的前提下，密切观察病情和胸部影像学变化。.
32134116,By 27 February 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively.
32134116,COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally.
32134116,Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).
32134116,Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days.
32134116,The basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS.
32134116,A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19.
32134116,Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem.
32134116,A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.
32134116,Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS.
32134116,We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.
32134116,This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future.
32134278,Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2).
32134278,The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32134278,The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century.
32134278,The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy.
32134278,Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics.
32134278,Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection.
32134278,Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection.
32134278,Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection.
32134278,The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases.
32134278,Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32134278,Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.
32138266,Within last 17 years two widespread epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China, which were caused by related coronaviruses (CoVs): SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
32138266,Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable.
32138266,Both viruses utilize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-for invading human bodies.
32138266,Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion.
32138266,Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats.
32138266,The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable.
32138266,Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel.
32138266,These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology.
32138266,However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan.
32138266,These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.
32138488,The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international significance.
32138488,There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management.
32138488,In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease.
32138488,Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades.
32138488,The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern.
32138488,There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock.
32138488,Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19.
32138488,Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age &gt;60 years (MuLBSTA score).
32138488,Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples.
32138488,Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation.
32138488,Role of steroids is still inconclusive.
32138488,Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed.
32138488,Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important.
32138488,Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended.
32138488,To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.
32141569,The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread.
32141569,The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV.
32141569,As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19.
32141569,COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology.
32141569,Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV.
32141569,However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein.
32141569,Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed.
32141569,COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV.
32141569,Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV.
32141569,The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV.
32141569,The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity.
32141569,In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense.
32141569,This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.
32141570,Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern.
32141570,This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks.
32141570,The data on the global outbreak of &quot;2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV&quot; were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes.
32141570,We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.
32141570,Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003.
32141570,MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019.
32141570,However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries.
32141570,It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020.
32141570,The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32141570,The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32141570,It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.
32141570,The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia.
32141570,Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.
32144890,Another animal to human transmission of a coronavirus occurred in December 2019 on a live animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan causing an epidemic in China, reaching now different continents.
32144890,This minireview summarizes the research literature on the virological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of this epidemic published until end of February 2020.
32145185,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012.
32145185,Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur.
32145185,Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths).
32145185,Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015.
32145185,MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures.
32145185,This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
32145718,The <i>'Healing the Schism: Epidemiology, Medicine, and the Public's Health'</i> by professor Kerr L.
32145718,White's be published has a history of nearly 30 years.
32145718,Since then, although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical medicine education, and breaking down separations between public health and clinical workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious.
32145718,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has opened a public class on the treatment, prevention and control of infectious diseases for the Chinese citizens.
32145718,Consequently, the Chinese people have higher expectations on the modernization of public health governance, and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive medicine and clinical medical education is establishing.
32145718,In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.
32145718,《弥合裂痕——流行病学、医学和公共卫生》问世已有近30年的历史，虽有有识之士不断呼吁在中国医学教育中加强公共卫生与临床医学的彼此融合，公共卫生专业工作者与临床医生之间应解除藩篱，但效果不甚明显。
32145718,新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情使全民接受了一场传染病救治和防控的&quot;公开课&quot;，公众对我国公共卫生治理有了更高的期盼，公共卫生与临床医学教育弥合裂痕的社会氛围正在形成。
32145718,未来在抗击新的重大传染病疫情和突发公共卫生事件时，我国公共卫生系统响应能力和临床救治能力必将显著提高，医防融合不足的局面势必得以扭转。.
32145719,To date, the controlling of outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered into a critical period in China.
32145719,Recently, work resumption and public place is planning to open outside of Hubei, suggesting an uncertain and complex development of the epidemic in the next stage.
32145719,Few days ago, we conducted a study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections of COVID-19, and found them might be the infection source.
32145719,We believe that the findings are critical for developing public health intervention strategies for controlling COVID-19 infection in the future.
32145719,Screening among the high-risk population and improving the sensitivity of measurement may contribute to the detection and management of asymptomatic infection.
32145719,目前我国疫情防控已进入关键时期。
32145719,近期湖北省外各地区逐渐开始复工、复产，疫情发展还具有不确定性和复杂性。
32145719,日前，研究者逐渐开始关注新冠肺炎隐性感染，描述隐性感染者的疾病进程及作为传染源的可能。
32145719,这对进一步优化和完善疫情防控措施提供了科学依据。
32145719,注重重点人群的筛查与自我防护、强化检测水平有助于无症状感染者的发现与管理。.
32146694,Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission.
32146694,Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections.
32146694,This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.
32146694,Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community.
32146694,Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples.
32146694,Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed.
32146694,As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening.
32146694,Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization.
32146694,Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs.
32146694,The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization.
32146694,These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest.
32146694,None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died.
32146694,The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases).
32146694,Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32146694,Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization.
32146694,However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness.
32146694,These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests.
32146694,Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.
32149037,The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020.
32149037,The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease.
32149037,The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team.
32149037,There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient).
32149037,The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache.
32149037,Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia.
32149037,Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients.
32149037,The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home.
32149037,COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases.
32149037,The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home.
32149037,Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease.
32149043,In the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease, investigating, classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease.
32149043,However, omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient.
32149043,To overcome these limitations, methods that can objectively verify the patient's claims (medical facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and closed-circuit television) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in South Korea.
32149484,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of a family clustering of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Field epidemiological survey was conducted. <b>Result:</b> Case 1 of the long-term residents from Hubei province was the source of infection of this family clustering.
32149484,There were 6 cases (from case 2 to case 7) infected in the whole incubation period.
32149484,The incubation period was more than 14 days for 3 of the second-generation cases.
32149484,Routes of transmission include respiratory droplets (from case 1 transmitted to case 6, from case 1 to her family members) and closecontact (from case 1 to other cases in her family).
32149484,All the age groups were generally susceptible, while elderly were easier to progress to critically ill.
32149484,Besides respiratory symptoms, there were also gastrointestinal symptoms, of which diarrhea was the most common one. <b>Conclusion:</b> Family clustering had been an important part for COVID-19 cases. <b>目的：</b> 通过对1起家庭聚集性新型冠状病毒肺炎8例病例的流行病学调查分析，探讨流行病学特征，为新型冠状病毒肺炎的防控提供依据。
32149484,<b>方法：</b> 采用描述性流行病学方法开展调查。
32149484,<b>结果：</b> 经调查来京湖北籍长居人员病例1为此次聚集病例的传染源，在整个潜伏期内共传染二代病例6人（病例2至病例7）。
32149484,出现三代疑似病例1例。
32149484,二代病例中有3例在暴露14 d后发病。
32149484,指示病例1传染到二代病例6的途径为近距离的呼吸道飞沫传播，指示病例1传染到家庭二代病例的途径包括呼吸道飞沫传播和密切接触传播两种方式。
32149484,青年、中年、老年等年龄段的人群普遍易感。
32149484,症状方面，老年人群病情较重，青年人群症状较轻。
32149484,除了呼吸道症状，腹泻等消化道症状、乏力肌肉酸痛头痛等其他症状也不容忽视。
32149484,<b>结论：</b> 家庭聚集性发病是新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控的重点。.
32150748,A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019.
32150748,There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.
32150748,To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications.
32150748,Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020.
32150748,News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
32150748,Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China.
32150748,Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization.
32150748,There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19.
32150748,The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.
32150748,These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.
32150748,Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.
32150748,This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.
32150748,Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

32153171,Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was of clustering onset in China and challenging to the Chinese healthcare system.
32153171,Epidemiological data showed that the older patients with chronic commodities were at high risk of the involvement of the severe and critical type of COVID-19, especially patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting in high mortalities.
32153171,There were nearly 100 million COPD patients in China, and most of them were the elderly.
32153171,Once infected with COVID-19, it would be life-threatening for the COPD patients.
32153171,Therefore, during the epidemic, it was of vital significance for us to attach great importance to optimize the management of COPD patients.
32153171,Based on these considerations, the COPD Group of the Chinese Thoracic Society (CTS) and the COPD working Committee of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians (CACP) altogether drafted the instruction for medical management and prevention of COPD during the COVID-19 epidemic period for the healthcare practitioner and patients.
32153171,目前，新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）在我国的疫情形势较为严峻，并有席卷全球的趋势。
32153171,流行病学资料显示：老年以及合并慢性基础疾病是重症、危重症的高危人群；合并慢性阻塞性肺疾病（慢阻肺）的患者具有较高的病死率。
32153171,我国有近1亿的慢阻肺患者，大多为老年人，一旦感染新冠肺炎，将给患者造成极大的生命威胁。
32153171,因此，在疫情期间，需要高度重视对慢阻肺患者进行规范的诊疗及防范。
32153171,中华医学会呼吸病学分会慢阻肺学组、中国医师协会呼吸医师分会慢阻肺工作委员会共同起草了新冠肺炎疫情期间慢阻肺医疗和防范须知，供相关医务人员以及患者参考。.
32156224,This is the sixth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 7 March 2020.
32156224,It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
32157849,<b>Objective:</b> To construct and evaluate a diagnosis process for 2019-Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> A continuous cohort of adults and adolescent (≥12 years) who screened COVID-19 was included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020 in which cases were divided the test library and the verification library.
32157849,Their gender, age, onset time were recorded.
32157849,Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement.
32157849,According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32157849,The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. <b>Results:</b> A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library.
32157849,In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years).
32157849,There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid.
32157849,Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively.
32157849,The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, <i>P</i>=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively).
32157849,The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32157849,The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31).
32157849,In validation library, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya process was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9% (10/13). <b>Conclusions:</b> The Xiangya process can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19 well, and can be applied as a reliable basis for confirmed cases detection in adults and adolescent (≥12 years) in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19.
32157849,The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation. <b>目的：</b> 构建新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的诊断流程（简称湘雅流程），评估其准确度。
32157849,<b>方法：</b> 纳入2020年1月23日至2月3日在中南大学湘雅医院排查COVID-19的≥12岁人群连续队列，按时间顺序分为试验库和验证库；记录该队列患者的性别、年龄、病程、流行病学史及发热，检测血常规及流感抗体。
32157849,所有患者均行胸部CT，评价罹患COVID-19的可能性（第1类和第2类被认为CT-COVID-19阳性，可能为COVID-19），评估肺受累范围。
32157849,按国家卫健委推荐诊疗方案（简称卫健委方案），采集疑似病例咽拭子标本，实时荧光定量聚合酶链式反应（RT-PCR）法检测新型冠状病毒核酸，在试验库中计算流行病学史、发热、血淋巴细胞降低及CT检出核酸阳性的效能，多指标构建COVID-19诊断的湘雅流程，检验湘雅流程及卫健委方案检出核酸阳性的效能，最后在验证库内验证湘雅流程的效能。

32157849,<b>结论：</b> 湘雅流程能预判新型冠状病毒核酸的检测结果，在流行期内可作为湖北省外地区≥12岁人群筛选COVID-19疑似病例的参考，但还需扩大样本进一步验证。.
32161092,The new decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (2020) started with the emergence of novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 that caused an epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.
32161092,It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans.
32161092,The source of origin, transmission to humans and mechanisms associated with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear yet, however, its resemblance with SARS-CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through genome sequencing related studies.
32161092,The development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infected people.
32161092,In this Review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the current outbreak in Wuhan, China.
32161092,Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
32161968,A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has raised world concern since it emerged in Wuhan Hubei China in December, 2019.
32161968,The infection may result into severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets.
32161968,Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias.
32161968,Nineteen 2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients (NON-NCOVID-19) in out of Hubei places were involved in this study.
32161968,Both NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected in throat swabs or/and sputa with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR.
32161968,We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
32161968,All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or travel to Hubei before illness.
32161968,The median duration, respectively, was 8 (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
32161968,The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
32161968,The most common symptoms were fever and cough.
32161968,Fifteen (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images.
32161968,Compared to NON-NCOVID-19, NCOVID-19 present remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests including AST, ALT, γ-GT, LDH and α-HBDH.
32161968,The 2019-nCoV infection caused similar onsets to other pneumonias.
32161968,CT scan may be a reliable test for screening NCOVID-19 cases.
32161968,Liver function damage is more frequent in NCOVID-19 than NON-NCOVID-19 patients.
32161968,LDH and α-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of NCOVID-19.

32165854,On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32165854,Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly.
32165854,On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources.
32165854,However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel.
32165854,On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19.
32165854,Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.
32167181,With an increasing number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases outside of Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics are facing challenges posed by the large number of admissions of patients suspected to have COVID-19.
32167181,Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei.
32167181,A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study.
32167181,The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission.
32167181,Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases.
32167181,The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases.
32167181,History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases.
32167181,Median time from illness onset to ED admission was 5 days for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases, respectively.
32167181,Fever was observed in 27 (84%) and 57 (68%) diagnosed and negative cases, respectively.
32167181,Nineteen (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had lymphopenia on admission in ED.
32167181,A chest CT scan on admission revealed the presence of pneumonia in the majority of the diagnosed patients (30 out of 32, 94%) and in 56 (67%) negative cases.
32167181,Bilateral involvement and ground-glass opacity (GGO) were present in 91% and 47% of the diagnosed patients.
32167181,Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases.
32167181,The median age of the diagnosed patients was 46 years, but only 35 years for negative cases.
32167181,History of exposure to Wuhan or COVID-19 patients in the previous 2 weeks was observed in 63% of the diagnosed and 44% of negative cases.
32167181,Median time from illness onset to ED admission was 5 days for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases, respectively.
32167181,Fever was observed in 27 (84%) and 57 (68%) diagnosed and negative cases, respectively.
32167181,Nineteen (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had lymphopenia on admission in ED.
32167181,A chest CT scan on admission revealed the presence of pneumonia in the majority of the diagnosed patients (30 out of 32, 94%) and in 56 (67%) negative cases.
32167181,Bilateral involvement and GGO were present in 91% and 47% of the diagnosed patients.
32167524,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide.
32167524,Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated.
32167524,To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died.
32167524,Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020.
32167524,The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020.
32167524,Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32167524,The development of ARDS and death.
32167524,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed.
32167524,Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men.
32167524,Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died.
32167524,In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]).
32167524,In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]).
32167524,High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82).
32167524,Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).
32167524,Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response.
32167524,Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS.
32167524,Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.
32168465,To determine the epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a remote region of China, far from Wuhan, we analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Gansu Province.
32168465,From January 23 through February 3, 2020, a total of 35 (64.8%) of 54 reported cases were imported from COVID-19-epidemic areas.
32168465,Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of transportation.
32168465,Time from infection to illness onset for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization.
32168465,Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers in Gansu Province.
32168465,As a result of adequate interventions, transmission of the COVID-19 virus in Gansu Province is decreasing.
32169119,An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.
32169119,On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.
32169119,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.
32169119,As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.
32169119,Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.
32169119,The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.
32169119,Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.
32169119,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
32169119,The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.
32169119,Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.
32169119,In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.
32170865,In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China.
32170865,A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus.
32170865,This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, respectively.
32170865,The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and all over the world now.
32170865,The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.
32171076,Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32171076,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.
32171076,In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.
32171076,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
32171076,We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).
32171076,Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.
32171076,Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.
32171076,The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.
32171076,The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.
32171076,Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

32171622,Cases of 2019-nCoV are now being reported in different regions around the globe, concerning for a possible SARS like epidemic that infected for than 8000 people in 2002-03.
32171622,Though, major health authorities are still working on understanding the virus and its transmission, here we present a brief report regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak and what is known so far.
32171867,Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.
32171867,However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation.
32171867,This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
32171867,Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb.
32171867,10, 2020.
32171867,All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
32171867,Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue.
32171867,One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L).
32171867,All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels.
32171867,Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.
32171867,Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them.
32171869,Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics.
32171869,We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.
32171869,In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai.
32171869,Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020.
32171869,Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male.
32171869,The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients.
32171869,Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients.
32171869,A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization.
32171869,The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms.
32171869,Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &lt;0.0001).
32171869,Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms.
32171869,154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14.
32171869,The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days).
32171869,Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P &lt;0.0001).
32171869,In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.
32171869,The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild.
32171869,The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.
32171952,There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020.
32171952,Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency.
32171952,At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities.
32171952,This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation.
32171952,This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.
32172228,A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world.
32172228,This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32172228,As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite.
32172228,Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
32172228,Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues.
32172228,Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.
32173576,To explore the epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and temporal progression of laboratory findings in 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exposed to lopinavir.
32173576,We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China.
32173576,Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3-7 days.
32173576,Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃).
32173576,An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities.
32173576,All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization.
32173576,Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using.
32173576,Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment.
32173576,Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge.
32173576,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 days, respectively.
32173576,Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement.
32173576,The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir using.
32173576,More researches on a larger scale are needed to verify these points.
32174057,Recently, some global cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia have been caused by second- or third-generation transmission of the viral infection, resulting in no traceable epidemiological history.
32174057,Owing to the complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, the first symptom and imaging features of patients can be very atypical and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections remains a challenge.
32174057,It would aid radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the early atypical symptom and imaging features of the disease and contribute to the prevention of infected patients being missed.
32174069,Since the first case of coronavirus disease19 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, as of March 2, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 89,069 cases in 67 countries and regions.
32174069,As of 0 am, March 2, 2020, the Republic of Korea had the second-largest number of confirmed cases (n = 4,212) after China (n = 80,026).
32174069,This report summarizes the epidemiologic features and the snapshots of the outbreak in the Republic of Korea from January 19 and March 2, 2020.
32174095,The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in Guangzhou, China in 2003 were caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses with high homology.
32174095,Since the 2019 novel coronavirus has strong transmissibility and progress rapidly.
32174095,It has caused negative social effects and massive economic damage on a global scale.
32174095,While there is currently no vaccine or effective drugs.
32174095,Pulmonary fibrosis is a pulmonary disease with progressive fibrosis, which is the main factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and quality of life decline in SARS survivors after recovery.
32174095,Extensive epidemiological, viral immunological, and current clinical evidences support the possibility that pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients.
32174095,Although there are no reports on the mechanism of COVID-19 inducing pulmonary fibrosis, based on the existing theoretical basis, we focus on the possible mechanism of COVID-19 sustained lung damaging, the key role of abnormal immune mechanism in the initiation and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis, and the corresponding therapeutic measures.
32174095,2019年12月暴发于中国武汉的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）与2003年暴发于中国广州的严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）是由同源性较高的高致命性冠状病毒导致的。
32174095,新型冠状病毒传播性强、进展迅速，在全球范围内造成不良的社会影响和巨大经济损失，但目前尚无针对COVID-19的疫苗或特效药物。
32174095,肺纤维化是一种进行性纤维化的肺部疾病，是导致SARS幸存者愈后肺功能障碍及生存质量下降的主要因素。
32174095,大量流行病学、病毒免疫学及目前的临床证据支持肺纤维化有可能成为COVID-19患者的严重并发症之一。
32174095,目前暂无关于COVID-19引发肺纤维化的机制的报道，本文就现有理论依据重点讨论COVID-19肺部持续损伤的可能机制、异常免疫机制在引发和促进肺纤维化中的关键作用以及相关治疗措施。.
32179660,To identify the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of pediatric patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
32179660,Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included.
32179660,The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis.
32179660,Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates.
32179660,There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases.
32179660,The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2-13 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys.
32179660,More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases.
32179660,The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0-42 days).
32179660,There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease.
32179660,The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time.
32179660,More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province.
32179660,Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference.
32179660,Although clinical manifestations of children's COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection.
32179660,The distribution of children's COVID-19 cases varied with time and space, and most of the cases were concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas.
32179660,Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence of human-to-human transmission.
32179701,Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease.
32179701,Here we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.
32179701,We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to 23 January 2020 travel restrictions.
32179701,Per person, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of documented infections ([46%-62%]), yet, due to their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
32179701,These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.
32179910,An epidemic caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection has spread unexpectedly in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019.
32179910,It is rarely reported about asymptomatic cases screened from close contacts.
32179910,We study epidemiological and clinical outcome of 55 asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory-confirmed positive for the SARS-Coronavirus-2 by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples.
32179910,The evidence showed that asymptomatic carriers occurred more often in middle aged people who had close contact with infected family members.
32179910,The majority of the cases developed to be mild and ordinary COVID-19 during hospital.
32180175,To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting medical staff.
32180175,We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19).
32180175,Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated.
32180175,We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.
32180175,The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients.
32180175,All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures.
32180175,Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension.
32180175,Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed.
32180175,Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19.
32180175,Three neonates were born prematurely.
32180175,There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events.
32180175,All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative.
32180175,No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period.
32180175,Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19.
32180175,Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive.
32180175,Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.
32181302,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has been recognized as a global threat, and several studies are being conducted using various mathematical models to predict the probable evolution of this epidemic.
32181302,These mathematical models based on various factors and analyses are subject to potential bias.
32181302,Here, we propose a simple econometric model that could be useful to predict the spread of COVID-2019.
32181302,We performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction on the Johns Hopkins epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019.
32181302,For further comparison or for future perspective, case definition and data collection have to be maintained in real time.
32181577,While it is too late to confine the COVID-19 coronovirus outbreak to China, a wealth of data spurs epidemiological and vaccine research.
32181807,Recent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei.
32181807,To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China.
32181807,Retrospective case series. 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.
32181807,Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020.
32181807,Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
32181807,The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%.
32181807,In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission.
32181807,In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple.
32181807,The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%).
32181807,The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days.
32181807,According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.
32181807,Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.
32183172,The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan was reported on 15 January 2020 and the number of reported cases has increased day by day.
32183172,The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020.
32183172,Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction.
32183172,By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R 0 = 2 .
32183172,6 ( 95 % CI, 2 .
32183172,4 - 2 . 8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer.
32183172,In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.
32183901,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019.
32183901,As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths.
32183901,The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32183901,A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley.
32183901,In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
32183901,The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
32183901,All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.
32183901,Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%).
32183901,The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars.
32183901,Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control.
32183901,Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed.
32183901,Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea.
32183901,Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission.
32183901,To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.
32183901,There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
32183901,During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.
32183901,Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.
32185921,Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious diseases.
32185921,Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases imported into China every year.
32185921,If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
32185921,Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.
32185921,This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019年底以来, 一种新型冠状病毒病肺炎 (COVID-19) 在我国大范围流行, 不仅严重威胁人民群众的生命安全和身体健康, 同时也给其他传染病防控带来了严峻挑战。
32185921,目前, 我国每年仍有近3 000例境外输入性疟疾病例, 如不能及时开展病例诊治和疫点调查处置, 不仅有可能危及患者生命, 还可能引起继发传播而威胁我国消除疟疾成果。
32185921,新型冠状病毒肺炎流行范围广、传播能力强, 不仅疟疾患者在就医过程中有可能被感染, 而且医务人员在开展临床诊治、样本检测和流行病学调查时也面临感染风险。
32185921,本文分析新型冠状病毒肺炎流行对我国消除疟疾工作的挑战, 并探讨相应的应对策略和措施, 从而为医务工作者提供参考。.
32187007,It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will continue to spread.
32187007,Although we still have limited information on the epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages.
32187007,Although SSEs appear to be difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs.
32187007,To prevent and control of SSEs, speed is essential.
32187007,Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends, first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events, particularly within healthcare settings.
32187007,Better understanding transmission dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings, strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future infectious disease outbreaks.
32188819,To assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings or crowded areas and to predict the spread of COVID-19 infections in Japan, we developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model with an additional modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas.
32188819,The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed.
32188819,Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area.
32188819,The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there.
32188819,The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly.
32188819,This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone.
32188819,On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours.
32188819,In conclusions The infection spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.
32190904,At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world.
32190904,However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and management.
32190904,Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients.
32190904,The discovery of the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts.
32190904,In addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find asymptomatic carriers as early as possible.
32190904,In conclusion, the prevention and control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers.

32190908,The emergence of the novel betacoronavirus, recently renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised serious concerns due to the virus's rapid dissemination worldwide.
32190908,Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Italy from surveillance studies.
32190908,The shortage of complete genomic sequences available impairs our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 introduction and establishment in the country.
32190908,To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analyzed complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples.
32190908,Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest possible multiple introduction of SARS-CoV-2.
32190908,Continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to improve monitoring and understanding of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.
32191174,2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
32191174,As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries.
32191174,An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons.
32191174,Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV.
32191174,Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated.
32191174,The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease.
32191174,This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV.
32191174,After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system.
32191174,Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified.
32191174,This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.
32191623,Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19 and sustained by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the latest biological hazard to assume the relevance of insidious worldwide threat.
32191623,One obvious question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks.
32191623,Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32191623,These include etiological diagnosis, patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance.
32191623,Nonetheless, some structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of whom are with severe disease.
32191623,Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.
32192278,To discuss whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), World Health Organization (WHO) organized the 15-member International Health Regulations Emergency Committee (EC).
32192278,On January 22-23 and January 30, 2020, EC convened and discussed whether the situation in China and other countries would constitute PHEIC and issued recommendations for WHO, China and the international community.
32192278,Based on the recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC.
32192278,One of the purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries.
32192278,On February 3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which includes accelerating research and development (R&amp;D) processes as one of three major strategies.
32192278,On February 11-12, 2020, WHO held the Global Research and Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap for COVID-19.
32192278,The fact that a COVID-19 R&amp;D forum was the first meeting convened after the PHEIC declaration testifies to the importance of R&amp;D in response to EID.
32192278,Korea has demonstrated a remarkable capacity in its laboratory response by conducting high-throughput COVID-19 testing and utilizing innovative drive-through samplings.
32192278,These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.
32192278,It is expected that Korea plays a global partner for COVID-19 research by actively participating in immediate and mid/long-term priorities jointly led by WHO and global partners.
32192296,Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China.
32192296,It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients.
32192296,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32192296,More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments.
32192296,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32192296,The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
32192296,(2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors.
32192296,Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.).
32192296,If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended.
32192296,(3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated.
32192296,All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.
32192296,(4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level.
32192296,After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.
32192296,We hope our &quot;Renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues.
32192296,新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）目前正在我国肆虐。
32192296,已经证实，新冠肺炎存在明显的院内感染现象，给外科医护人员和住院患者造成严重威胁。
32192296,虽然结直肠外科并不是此次抗击疫情的一线学科，但在特殊的形式下，如何最大限度地在保护患者、家属、医务工作者自身的健康以及病区和医院医疗安全的前提下，为患者提供最优质的医疗服务，保证以往临床工作的有序开展，是当下的艰巨任务。
32192296,笔者参照我国《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案》，结合《上海仁济医院新型冠状病毒文件汇总》的实际工作情况，总结了新冠肺炎疫情防控形势下，如何开展结直肠外科临床工作，分享了如何在疫情防控情况下，针对结直肠肿瘤急诊患者的诊疗流程、对结直肠肿瘤的诊断和准备择期入院手术结直肠癌患者的处理、病房的防护、围手术期的管理等，更重要的是详细介绍了疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术及围手术期的管理，包括医务人员及手术室、手术器械的防控措施。
32192296,其中特别强调的包括：（1）多学科诊疗模式(MDT)应贯穿于结直肠肿瘤整个诊疗过程，MDT成员中，除常规相科室外，呼吸科和感染科也需列入。（
32192296,2）肠镜检查有可能导致患者交叉感染，对操作人员和护理人员也存在较大风险，故仅优先对于可能危及生命的急诊患者（出血、梗阻、消化道异物等）进行；若疑似新冠肺炎患者，不采取内镜下减压措施，直接拟定急诊手术治疗方案。（
32192296,3）疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者应放置于隔离病室，配备单独医疗器具，在指定的独立负压（-5 Pa以下）手术间完成手术；围手术期伤口换药等使用过所有一次性物品、体液、粪便等，均按医疗废物规范进行处置。（
32192296,4）参加疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术的医护人员应实施三级防护，术后应隔离进行&quot;医学观察&quot;14 d。
32192296,希望能对同道有所助益。.
32192424,This is the seventh epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 14 March 2020.
32192424,It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
32192580,Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.
32192580,We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32192580,Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases.
32192580,We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2.
32192580,As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined.
32192580,Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded.
32192580,The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3-6).
32192580,The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days.
32192580,SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.
32192580,Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.
32192580,None.
32193905,The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide.
32193905,Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community.
32193905,Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea.
32193905,The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19.
32193905,In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens.
32193905,Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.
32194034,With the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) pandemic spreading quickly in the United States and the world, it is urgent that the rehabilitation community quickly understands the epidemiology of the virus and what we can and must do to face this microbial adversary at the early stages of this likely long global pandemic.
32194034,The 2019-nCoV is a novel virus so most of the world's population does not have prior immunity to it.
32194034,It is more infectious and fatal than seasonal influenza, and definitive treatment and a vaccine are months away.
32194034,Our arsenal against it is currently mainly social distancing and infection control measures.
32198776,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health.
32198776,This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease.
32198776,Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.
32198776,A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
32198776,The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).
32198776,The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area.
32198776,Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]).
32198776,Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).
32198776,Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.
32198776,All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).
32198776,In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).
32198776,It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.
32198776,Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.
32198776,This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients.
32198776,Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.
32198776,Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.
32198834,COVID-19 is novel infectious disease with an evolving understanding of its epidemiology and clinical manifestations.
32198834,Immunocompromised patients often present atypical presentations of viral diseases.
32198834,Herein we report a case of a COVID-19 infection in a solid organ transplant recipient, in which the first clinical symptoms were of gastrointestinal viral disease and fever, which further progressed to respiratory symptoms in 48 hours.
32198834,In these high risk populations, protocols for screening for SARS-Cov2 may be needed to be re-evaluated.
32198985,Autopsy is of great significance to the elucidation of the pathological changes, pathogeneses and causes of death of corona virus disease 2019 （COVID-19） and can provide theoretical basis for more scientific and accurate prevention and control of the outbreak.
32198985,Based on related laws and regulations, such as the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, and the related guidelines on the prevention and control of the outbreak, combined with the practical work of forensic pathology examination, the Guide to the Forensic Pathology Practice on Death Cases Related to Corona Virus Disease 2019 （COVID-19） （Trial Draft） has been developed.
32198985,This guide includes information on the background investigation of the cases, autopsy room requirements, personal prevention and protections, external examinations, autopsy, auxiliary examinations, and so on.
32198985,This guide can be used as a reference by forensic and pathological examination institutions, as well as examination staff.

32199619,To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32199619,Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected.
32199619,The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed.
32199619,The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised.
32199619,Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity.
32199619,The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea.
32199619,A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients.
32199619,The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%).
32199619,Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area.
32199619,Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions.
32199619,Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow.
32199619,The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions.
32199619,Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare.
32199619,As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect.
32199877,It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China.
32199877,So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries.
32199877,However, epidemiological data differ between countries.
32199877,Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020.
32199877,The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India.
32199877,The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62).
32199877,However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were &lt;10 per day.
32199877,Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan.
32199877,This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan.
32199877,In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI.
32199877,However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.
32200613,A new type of coronavirus, i.e. se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly known as 2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in the province of Hubei, China, and over the past four months the number of cases of infection has exceeded 240,000 worldwide, leading to a pandemia [1].
32200613,At the genetic level, 2019-nCoV is closely related to the SARS-CoV and, to a lesser extent, to MERS-CoV, which appeared as epidemiological threats in recent years in China and the Middle East, respectively.
32200613,Infections with the Coronaviridae virus family in a small percentage of patients, especially in those over 60 years of age with a positive clinical history, lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome [2].
32201353,The pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is a highly contagious disease.
32201353,The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency.
32201353,Currently, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage.
32201353,Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.
32201353,This review in the hope of helping the public effectively recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a reference for future studies.
32202240,A severe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019, and spread so rapidly that more than 200,000 cases have so far been reported worldwide; on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared it the sixth public health emergency of international concern.
32202240,The two previously reported coronavirus epidemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]) share similar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features as COVID-19.
32202240,As little is currently known about SARS-CoV-2, it is likely that lessons learned from these major epidemics can be applied to the new pandemic, including the use of novel immunosuppressive drugs.
32204756,To study the clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infants and young children.
32204756,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020.
32204756,All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children.
32204756,Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea.
32204756,There were only symptoms of the respiratory system.
32204756,Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count.
32204756,Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count.
32204756,CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles.
32204756,As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign.
32204756,Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection.
32204756,Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children.
32205284,To investigate the epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.
32205284,Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection of Zhejiang province from Jan 17 to Feb 8 underwent CT or x-ray were enrolled.
32205284,Epidemiological, clinical data were analyzed between those with abnormal or normal imaging findings.
32205284,Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients affected more than two lobes.
32205284,The median radiograph score was 2.0 and there's negative correlation between the score and oxygenation index (ρ=-0.657,P &lt; 0.001).
32205284,Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with higher rate of coexisting condition(28.8%), lower rate of exposure history and longer time between onset and confirmation(5d) than non-pneumonia patients(all P &lt; 0.05).
32205284,Higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration, and headache, lower lymphocytes, albumin, serum sodium levels and higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels and lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P &lt; 0.05).
32205284,Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels and higher serum creatinine and radiograph score at admission were predictive factors for severe/critical subtype.
32205284,Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes.
32205284,Combing clinical features and radiograph score can effectively predict severe/critical type.
32205349,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lies behind the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32205349,There is a growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in the virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies.
32205349,However, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug or vaccine has been officially approved due to the absence of adequate evidence.
32205349,Scientists are racing towards the development of treatment for COVID-19.
32205349,Recent studies have revealed many attractive threptic options, even if some of them remain to be further confirmed in rigorous preclinical models and clinical trials.
32205349,In this minireview, we aim to summarize the updated potential approaches against SARS-CoV-2.
32205349,We emphasize that further efforts are warranted to develop the safest and most effective approach.
32207032,Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide.
32207032,Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described.
32207032,A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province.
32207032,A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected.
32207032,The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed.
32207032,Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1.
32207032,The median age was 3 years.
32207032,COVID-19 cases in children aged &lt;3 years, 3.6 years, and ≥6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively.
32207032,The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]).
32207032,Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%).
32207032,Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2).
32207032,Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin.
32207032,The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged.
32207032,It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children.
32207032,However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.
32207910,The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, travel, and commerce.
32207910,This overview analyzes the best information from the early research, including epidemiologic and demographic features from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV viruses; lessons learned from the experience of an emergency physician in Northern Italy, where the outbreak has devastated the healthcare system; evidence on transmission and prevention through safe use of PPE; evidence and advice on SARS-CoV-2 testing and co-infection; management options; airway management options; steps for rapid sequence intubation in the ED and managing disaster ventilation; and information on managing pediatric and pregnant patients.
32210236,Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world.
32210236,Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere.
32210236,To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports.
32210236,All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history.
32210236,The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.
32210741,Direct-acting antivirals are effective tools to control viral infections.
32210741,SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus associated with the epidemiological outbreak in late 2019.
32210741,Previous reports showed that HIV-1 protease inhibitors could block SARS-CoV main protease.
32210741,Based on that and using an <i>in silico</i> approach, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 main protease as a target for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their antiviral effect.
32210741,Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
32210741,Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated.
32210741,Our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features.
32210741,Then, these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives optimizing their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.
32210741,Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.
32211844,The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a big threat to China, with high contagious capacity and varied mortality.
32211844,This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of older patients with COVID-19 out of Wuhan.
32211844,A retrospective study was performed, with collecting data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province from Jan 17 to Feb 12, 2020.
32211844,Epidemiological, clinical and treatment data were analyzed between those older (≥60y) and younger (&lt;60y) patients.
32211844,Total 788 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were selected, where 136 were older patients with corresponding age of 68.28y±7.314y.
32211844,There was a significantly higher frequency of women in the older patients compared with the younger patients (57.35% vs 46.47%, P=0.021).
32211844,The presence of coexisting medical condition was significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients (55.15% vs 21.93%, P&lt;0.001), including the rate of hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases and COPD.
32211844,Significantly higher rates of severe (older vs younger groups: 16.18% vs 5.98%, P&lt;0.001)/critical (8.82% vs 0.77%, P&lt;0.001) type, shortness of breath (12.50% vs 3.07%, P&lt;0.001) and high temperature of &gt;39.0℃ (13.97% vs 7.21%, P=0.010) were observed in older patients compared with younger patients.
32211844,Finally, Higher rates of ICU admission (9.56% vs 1.38%, P&lt;0.001) and methylprednisolone application (28.68% vs 9.36%, P&lt;0.001) were also identified in older patients.
32211844,The specific epidemiological and clinical features of older COVID-19 patients included significantly higher female gender, body temperature, co-existing of basic diseases and rate of severe and critical type.
32213269,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the characteristics of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, and provide epidemiological evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> The data of all the cluster cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin reported as 22 February 2020 were collected to analyze the characteristics of different types of the clusters. <b>Results:</b> A total of 115 COVID-19 cases were reported in in 33 clusters in Tianjin.
32213269,Clusters can be classified as following: 28 familial clusters (71 cases), 1 work place cluster (10 cases), 3 transport vehicle clusters (8 cases) and 1 public place cluster (26 cases).
32213269,Fourteen familial clusters were caused by the cases from the working place or public place clusters.
32213269,Numbers of secondary cases of family clusters were 1-7, the median number was 7.
32213269,The interval from onset to diagnosis for the first case was longer than those of other cases in the familial clusters (Z=-2.406, <i>P</i>= 0.016).
32213269,The median of incubation period of the public place clusters was 2 days.
32213269,The intervals from onset to diagnosis were significant different among the family, working place and public place clusters (<i>H</i>=8.843, , <i>P</i>=0.012) , and there were also significant differences in onset time among the secondary cases (<i>H</i>=16.607, <i>P</i>=0.000) . <b>Conclusions:</b> In the surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic, special attention should be paid to the cases from same family, same work place, or other places where clustering are prone to occur, and the epidemiological investigation should be carried out timely to confirm the cluster.
32213269,To prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the close contacts of the patients should be transferred to an assigned observation place in time for single room isolation.
32213269,The awareness of COVID-19 prevention is low in some rural areas, reflected by many mass gathering activities and delayed medical care seeking after onset.
32213269,It is necessary to strengthen the health education and take control measures in early period of epidemic. <b>目的：</b> 分析天津市新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）聚集性疫情病例情况，掌握不同类型聚集性病例发病特征，为COVID-19防控提供流行病学证据和经验。

32213269,聚集性病例分为4类：家庭聚集（28起，71例）、单位聚集（1起，10例）、交通工具（3起，8例）和公共场所（1起，26例），其中单位和公共场所聚集性疫情中的病例又导致了14起家庭聚集性疫情。
32213269,家庭聚集的续发病例1~7例，中位数为2例。
32213269,家庭首发病例发病到确诊时间长于续发病例（<i>Z</i>＝-2.406，<i>P=</i>0.016）。
32213269,公共场所聚集的潜伏期中位数为7d。
32213269,家庭、单位和公共场所3类聚集性疫情相比较，病例发病到确诊时间差异有统计学意义（<i>H=</i>8.843, <i>P</i>=0.012），续发病例发病时间差异有统计学意义（<i>H</i>=16.607，<i>P</i>=0.000）。
32213269,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19疫情监测应特别关注同一家庭、同一集体单位等容易发生聚集性疫情场所，及时开展细致的流行病学调查和排查。
32213269,出现聚集性疫情的场所内部，应及时将密切接触者转至统一的隔离观察点，严格单间管理，避免疫情扩散。
32213269,部分农村地区防疫意识不强，聚集活动较多，且发病后就诊不及时，在疫情初期应该加强防控的宣传和控制措施。.
32213270,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the cases of COVID-19 epidemic clusters, and explore the influence of family factors and social factors such as group activities on the spread of the disease. <b>Methods:</b> The data of cases of COVID-19 epidemic clusters from 19 January, 2020 to 25 February, 2020 were collected from the official platforms of 36 cities in 6 provinces in China.

32213556,The SARS-CoV-2-infected disease (COVID-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings.
32213556,Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms.
32213556,We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics.
32213556,COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020.
32213556,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type.
32213556,Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.
32213556,Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease.
32213556,Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%).
32213556,Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever &gt;38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively.
32213556,Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively.
32213556,Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type.
32213556,Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m<sup>6</sup>A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2.
32213556,We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan.
32213556,Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.
32214083,On February 28, 2020, a case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in a woman resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington.
32214083,* Epidemiologic investigation of facility A identified 129 cases of COVID-19 associated with facility A, including 81 of the residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died.
32214083,Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread.
32214083,COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death.
32214083,Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members and visitors, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures.
32216961,To report the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Xiaogan, Hubei, China.
32216961,The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively.
32216961,Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>) in patients.
32216961,Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients.
32216961,Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%).
32216961,Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%).
32216961,Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas.
32216961,Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%).
32216961,The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%).
32216961,CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO<sub>2</sub> and lymphocyte numbers (p&lt;0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively.
32216961,Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.
32217506,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.
32217506,Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have a high vulnerability and variable capacity to respond to outbreaks.
32217506,Many of these countries addressed the need for increasing capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid response to public health threats.
32217506,Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that direct the public to actions for self- and community protection.
32217506,This viewpoint article aims to highlight the contribution of the Global Health Development (GHD)/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR's Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETPs) to prepare for and respond to the current COVID-19 threat.
32217506,GHD/EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through health promotion, training and training materials, guidelines, coordination, and communication.
32217506,The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and screening at the ports of entry, development of communication materials and guidelines, and sharing information to health professionals and the public.
32217506,However, some countries remain ill-equipped, have poor diagnostic capacity, and are in need of further capacity development in response to public health threats.
32217506,It is essential that GHD/EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health emergencies.
32217947,We describe an evidence-based approach for optimization of infection control and operating room management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32217947,Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily but not exclusively contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization.
32217947,Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C).
32217947,(1) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the IV pole to the left of the provider.
32217947,Double glove during induction.
32217947,(2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag, on the IV pole to the right of the provider.
32217947,Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (i.e. laryngoscope blades and handles) and close.
32217947,Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas.
32217947,After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol.
32217947,Use a top down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden.
32217947,Treat operating rooms using UV-C.
32217947,(3) Decolonize patients using pre-procedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone iodine within one hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse.
32217947,(4) Create a closed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection.
32217947,(5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of ESKAPE transmission.
32217947,(6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure, use relatively long (e.g., 12-hour) staff shifts.
32217947,If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases, not 8 first case starts.
32217947,(7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent.
32217947,(8) Do not have patients go into a large, pooled phase I post-anesthesia care unit, because of the risk of contaminating facility at large along with many staff.
32217947,Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery, like done routinely in Japan.
32217947,These 8 programmatic recommendations stand on a substantial body of empirical evidence characterizing the epidemiology of perioperative transmission and infection development made possible by support from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF).
32220177,This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus.
32220177,SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection.
32220177,The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus.
32220177,The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia.
32220177,Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far.
32220177,In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated.
32220177,Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued.
32220177,Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment.
32220177,In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic.
32220181,We studied the epidemiological and clinical data collected from a family with 5 people, in which there were 3 family member diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32220181,We found that the first patient in this family had Wuhan city travel history.
32220181,Close contact in daily life was the route of infection.
32220181,The most common symptoms were fever, cough and weakness.
32220181,Characteristic imaging changes were found with grass opacity (GGO), consolidation and septal thickening mainly distributed in peripheral and posterior area by thoracic CT scan in the 3 patients.
32220181,The abnormality in laborotary test included lower white blood cell count, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count，increasing fibrinogen and C-reactive protein，decreasing myohaemoglobin and increasing lactate dehydrogenase.
32220181,The epidemiological and clinical features could provide quicker diagnosis and better management for the COVID-19 infected patients.
32220208,Long-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.
32220208,After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health-Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.
32220208,As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.
32220208,Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.
32220208,Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.
32220208,The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).
32220208,As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.
32220208,In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.
32220650,Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally.
32220650,Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.
32220650,We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China.
32220650,We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.
32220650,From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32220650,The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).
32220650,Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).
32220650,Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5-38·5°C.
32220650,Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).
32220650,Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.
32220650,All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir-ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.
32220650,Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.
32220650,By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.
32220650,Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

32220655,In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China.
32220655,Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures.
32220655,We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.
32220655,To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community.
32220655,Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures.
32220655,We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases.
32220655,We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April).
32220655,Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively.
32220655,There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond.
32220655,However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.
32220655,Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak.
32220655,Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually.
32220655,However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R<sub>0</sub> and the duration of infectiousness.

32222986,In December 2019, an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to worldwide, which has attracted many people's concerns about the patients.
32222986,However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel is still lacking.
32222986,A total of 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study.
32222986,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method.
32222986,From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32222986,Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%).
32222986,Among the 54 patients with COVID-19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P = .0015).
32222986,However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups.
32222986,Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs with severe-/critical-type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P = .028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P = .012).
32222986,Based on our findings with medical staff infection data, we suggest training for all hospital staff to prevent infection and preparation of sufficient protection and disinfection materials.
32222993,This report describes the isolation, molecular characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of the first three complete genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from three patients involved in the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardy, Italy.
32222993,Early molecular epidemiological tracing suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was present in Italy weeks before the first reported cases of infection.
32223012,Assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 illness, has been a major activity of infection services since the first reports of cases in December 2019.
32223012,We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK.
32223012,Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected.
32223012,We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
32223012,Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female.
32223012,Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19.
32223012,Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus.
32223012,Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate.
32223012,Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials.
32223012,The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention.
32223012,This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients.
32223012,Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops.
32223725,This is the eighth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia as at 23:59 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 22 March 2020.
32223725,It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
32226288,Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia.
32226288,No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease.
32226288,The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently.
32226288,At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment.
32226288,In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed.
32226288,Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.
32226288,Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.
32226289,A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world.
32226289,Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV.
32226289,Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs.
32226289,Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32226289,Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.
32226289,Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2.
32226289,Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.
32226295,The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
32226295,Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
32226295,However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
32226295,In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
32226295,We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
32226295,Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
32228732,As an emerging infectious disease, COVID-19 has involved many countries and regions.
32228732,With the further development of the epidemic, the proportion of clusters has increased.
32228732,In our study, we collected information on COVID-19 clusters in Qingdao City.
32228732,The epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations were analyzed.
32228732,Eleven clusters of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao City between January 29, and February 23, 2020, involving 44 confirmed cases, which accounted for 73.33% of all confirmed cases.
32228732,From January 19 to February 2, 2020, the cases mainly concentrated in the district that had many designated hospitals.
32228732,Patients aged 20-59 y old accounted for the largest proportion (68.18%) of cases; the male-to-female sex ratio was 0.52:1.
32228732,Three cases were infected from exposure to confirmed cases.
32228732,The average incubation period was 6.28 d.
32228732,The median number of cases per cluster was 4, and the median duration time was 6 d.
32228732,The median cumulative number of exposed persons was 53.
32228732,More attention should be paid to the epidemic of clusters in prevention and control of COVID-19.
32228732,In addition to isolating patients, it is essential to track, screen, and isolate those who have come in close contact with patients.
32228732,Self-isolation is the key especially for healthy people in the epidemic area.
32228809,We report epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster.
32228809,Our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings.
32228809,These findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment.
32228860,The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics is often a story about the numbers.
32228860,In this snapshot, our aim is to provide a one-stop, curated graphical source for the key numbers that help us understand the virus driving our current global crisis.
32228860,The discussion is framed around two broad themes: 1) the biology of the virus itself and 2) the characteristics of the infection of a single human host.
32228860,Our one-page summary provides the key numbers pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, based mostly on peer-reviewed literature.
32228860,The numbers reported in summary format are substantiated by the annotated references below.
32228860,Readers are urged to remember that much uncertainty remains and knowledge of this pandemic and the virus driving it is rapidly evolving.
32228860,In the paragraphs below we provide 'back of the envelope' calculations that exemplify the insights that can be gained from knowing some key numbers and using quantitative logic.
32228860,These calculations serve to improve our intuition through sanity checks, but do not replace detailed epidemiological analysis.
32229157,The last month of 2019 harbingered the emergence of a viral outbreak that is now a major public threat globally.
32229157,COVID-19 was first diagnosed and confirmed in a couple of cases with unknown pneumonia; the patients lived in, or travelled to, Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.
32229157,People now face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally.
32229157,Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched.
32229157,In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19.
32229157,Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems-for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases-are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19.
32229157,Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.
32230900,The outbreak of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China has been brought to global attention and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.
32230900,Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection.
32230900,As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health.
32230900,To provide a comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential readers worldwide, we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce the current state of development of measures in this review.
32231374,Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally.
32231374,Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters.
32231374,In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves.
32231374,On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates.
32231374,By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29.
32231374,As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged.
32231374,Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ∼4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ∼3.2.
32231374,Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ∼2.6 based on confirmed cases and ∼2 based on the second scenario.
32231374,Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China.
32231374,Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29.
32231374,Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29.
32231374,Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones.
32231374,Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around ∼0.15% in the total population.
32231374,Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.
32232218,In the beginning of 2020, an unexpected outbreak due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world.
32232218,Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat.
32232218,The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
32232218,A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020.
32232218,All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis.
32232218,The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study.
32232218,According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.43%) and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%-9.28%), respectively.
32232218,According to the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively.
32232980,In mid-December 2019, a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, which began in Wuhan, China, has spread throughout the country and many countries around the world.
32232980,The number of children with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has also increased significantly.
32232980,Although information regarding the epidemiology of COVID-19 in children has accumulated, relevant comprehensive reports are lacking.
32232980,The present article reviews the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children.
32233562,We propose a mathematical model to investigate the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.
32233562,Our model describes the multiple transmission pathways in the infection dynamics, and emphasizes the role of the environmental reservoir in the transmission and spread of this disease.
32233562,Our model also employs non-constant transmission rates which change with the epidemiological status and environmental conditions and which reflect the impact of the on-going disease control measures.
32233562,We conduct a detailed analysis of this model, and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data.
32233562,Among other findings, our analytical and numerical results indicate that the coronavirus infection would remain endemic, which necessitates long-term disease prevention and intervention programs.
32233876,Emergency trauma radiology, although a relatively new subspecialty of radiology, plays a critical role in both the diagnosis/triage of acutely ill patients, but even more important in providing leadership and taking the lead in the preparedness of imaging departments in dealing with novel highly infectious communicable diseases and mass casualties.
32233876,This has become even more apparent in dealing with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in late 2019.
32233876,We review the symptoms, epidemiology, and testing for this disease.
32233876,We discuss characteristic imaging findings of COVID-19 in relation to other modern coronavirus diseases including SARS and MERS.
32233876,We discuss roles that community radiology clinics, outpatient radiology departments, and emergency radiology departments can play in the diagnosis of this disease.
32233876,We review practical methods to reduce spread of infections within radiology departments.
32234107,This study describes the epidemiologic features of an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tianjin caused by a novel coronavirus and provides the scientific basis for prevention and control measures.
32234107,Data from COVID-19 cases were collected from daily notifications given to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Tianjin Health Committee.
32234107,All of the data were analyzed with SPSS, version 24.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
32234107,As of February 24, 2020, there have been 135 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and 87 recoveries in Tianjin, China.
32234107,The incidence of COVID-19 was 8.65/1 000 000 with a 2.22% case fatality rate.
32234107,Regarding geographic distribution, the incidence was 8.82 per 1 000 000 in urban areas and 8.00 per 1 000 000 in suburbs.
32234107,During the early stage of the epidemic, most cases came from urban areas and in patients with a history of sojourning in Hubei Province.
32234107,The majority of patients were 31-70 years old (75.97%).
32234107,A familial clustering was the most important characteristic of COVID-19 (accounting for 74.81%).
32234107,Current information suggests that people are generally susceptible to COVID-19, which has shown a familial clustering in Tianjin.
32234115,To rapidly assess possible community transmission in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands, healthcare workers (HCW) with mild respiratory complaints and without epidemiological link (contact with confirmed case or visited areas with active circulation) were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32234115,Within 2 days, 1,097 HCW in nine hospitals were tested; 45 (4.1%) were positive.
32234115,Of six hospitals with positive HCW, two accounted for 38 positive HCW.
32234115,The results informed local and national risk management.
32234127,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different epidemic stages in Gansu province. <b>Methods:</b> Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. <b>Results:</b> As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu.
32234127,The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage.
32234127,A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure.
32234127,The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=2.20, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) and fatigue (trend <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=3.18, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant.
32234127,The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (<i>H</i>=6.45, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).
32234127,Also, the incubation period prolonged along with the epidemic stage (<i>F</i>=51.65, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (<i>F</i>=5.32, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (<i>F</i>=5.25, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01) became shorter along with the epidemic stage.
32234127,Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. <b>Conclusions:</b> The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused by the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones.
32234127,No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure.
32234127,With the progression of COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu, the change in initial symptom and incubation period suggests, the early screening cannot only depend on body temperature monitoring. <b>目的：</b> 对甘肃省确诊的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）病例进行流行病学特征分析，探索疫情流行的阶段性特征和变化。
32234127,<b>方法：</b> 通过流行病学调查收集甘肃省COVID-19病例资料，包括基本资料、流行病学史、发病、就诊和确诊时间、临床表现等信息。
32234127,<b>结果：</b> 截至2020年2月25日，甘肃省共报告91例确诊病例，COVID-19流行分为输入病例期、输入病例与本地病例并存期、本地病例为主期3个阶段。
32234127,聚集性疫情病例共63例（69.23%）。
32234127,医务人员有3例，均为非职业暴露感染。
32234127,首发症状为发热、咳嗽和乏力的比例分别为54.95%（50/91）、52.75%（48/91）和28.57%（26/91），且在3个阶段中的比例呈下降趋势，但只有发热与乏力症状的差异有统计学意义（趋势<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>值分别为2.20和3.18，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）；3个阶段的重型/危重型病例比例分别为42.86%（6/14）、23.73%（14/59）和16.67%（3/18），呈下降趋势（<i>H</i>＝6.40，<i>P</i>&lt;0.05）；潜伏期随着疫情的3个阶段有延长的趋势（<i>F</i>＝51.65，<i>P</i>&lt;0.01）；发病到就诊、发病到确诊的时间间隔随着疫情进展有缩短的趋势（<i>F</i>值分别为5.32和5.25，<i>P</i>&lt;0.01）；基本再生数（<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>）从输入病例期的2.61降至本地病例为主期的0.66。
32234127,<b>结论：</b> 甘肃省COVID-19流行早期均为湖北省输入，聚集性疫情占三分之二，未发现医务人员职业性暴露感染。
32234127,总体流行呈阶段性变化特征，随着疫情进展有首发症状不明显和潜伏期延长的特点，并提示体温监测不能作为单一的早期筛查手段。.
32234128,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of 5 confirmed COVID⁃19 cases related with the transmission in incubation period of initial case, and find out the infection source and transmission chain.. <b>Methods:</b> According to &quot;The Prevention and Control Protocol for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Third Edition)&quot; issued by the National Health Commission, a field epidemiological survey was conducted for the 5 cases in January 2020.
32234128,Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from them for the detection of 2019-nCoV by real time RT-PCR.
32234128,Multi prevention and control measures were taken, such as tracking and screening close contacts, medical isolation observation, investigating the epidemiological link, analyzing transmission chain. <b>Results:</b> Case 1, who had common environmental exposure with other COVID⁃19 cases, got sick on 20 January, 2020 and was confirmed on 1 February.
32234128,Case 2 became symptomatic on 22 January and was confirmed on 27 January.
32234128,Case 3 got sick on 25 January and was confirmed on 30 January.
32234128,Case 4 had illness onset on 20 January and was confirmed on 1 February.
32234128,Case 5 got sick on 23 January and was confirmed on 31 January.
32234128,Among the 5 cases, case 2 died and the illness of other cases were effectively controlled.
32234128,After exclusion of other common exposure factors, case 1 had a 6-hour meeting with case 2 and case 3 on 19 January.
32234128,Case 2 and case 3 might be infected by case 1 during the incubation period.
32234128,It is the key point for epidemiological investigation. <b>Conclusion:</b> The epidemiological investigation indicates that the transmission might occur in the incubation period of COVID-19 case, close attention should be paid to it in future COVID-19 prevention and control. <b>目的：</b> 对上海市一起由新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID⁃19）病例在潜伏期传染的聚集性疫情开展流行病学调查，查明感染来源和病例传播链。
32234128,<b>方法：</b> 按照新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控方案（第三版）要求，2020年1月采用现场流行病学调查方法，对5例病例开展个案调查，采集鼻咽拭子和痰液等标本，采用real time RT-PCR检测新型冠状病毒核酸，追踪排查密切接触者并采取隔离医学观察，调查病例间的流行病学联系，分析传播链等，并及时落实相关防控措施。
32234128,<b>结果：</b> 病例一于2020年1月20日发病，有与COVID-19确诊病例共同环境的暴露史，2月1日确诊；病例二于1月22日发病，1月27日确诊；病例三于1月25日发病，1月30日确诊；病例四于1月20日发病，2月1日确诊；病例五于1月23日发病，1月31日确诊。
32234128,5例病例中，除病例二死亡外，其余4例病例病情均得到有效控制。

32234128,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19病例在潜伏内可能具有传染性，这对后面的疫情防控工作带来一定的警示和借鉴作用。.
32234451,The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new human coronavirus which is spreading with epidemic features in China and other Asian countries with cases reported worldwide.
32234451,This novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32234451,Although related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which have not been completely understood to date.
32234451,We provide a review of the differences in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features between COVID-19, SARS and MERS.
32234451,The most recent literature in English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics.
32234451,COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features.
32234451,However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than SARS (9.5%) and much lower than MERS (34.4%).
32234451,It cannot be excluded that because of the COVID-19 less severe clinical picture it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS.
32234451,The actual basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) of COVID-19 (2-2.5) is still controversial.
32234451,It is probably slightly higher than the R<sub>0</sub> of SARS (1.7-1.9) and higher than MERS (&lt;1),.
32234451,The gastrointestinal route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which has been also assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs to be further investigated.
32234451,There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and capacity of spreading on a pandemic level.
32234451,Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons to face this new global threat.
32234466,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China, and has spread quickly to 72 countries to date.
32234466,COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)].
32234466,At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health.
32234466,However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19.
32234466,Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
32234466,Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics.
32234468,In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern.
32234468,SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32234468,Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days.
32234468,Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients.
32234468,This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19.
32234468,Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article.
32234468,In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.
32235486,A growing body of literature on the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is becoming available, but a synthesis of available data has not been conducted.
32235486,We performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32235486,We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS from 01 January 2019 to 24 February 2020.
32235486,Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers.
32235486,Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results.
32235486,A total of 61 studies were included (59,254 patients).
32235486,The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%-99%; <i>n</i> = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%-81%; <i>n</i> = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%-55%; <i>n</i> = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; <i>n</i> = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%-23%, <i>n</i> = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%-17%, <i>n</i> = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%-17%, <i>n</i> = 1744).
32235486,Laboratory findings were described in a lower number of patients and revealed lymphopenia (0.93 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, 95% CI 0.83-1.03 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, <i>n</i> = 464) and abnormal C-reactive protein (33.72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54-45.91 mg/dL; <i>n</i> = 1637).
32235486,Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation.
32235486,Data on treatment options were limited.
32235486,All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%-1.0%; <i>n</i> = 53,631).
32235486,Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients.
32235486,The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific.
32235486,Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay.
32236624,The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old viral enemy and has raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures and the healthcare system to handle such a threat.
32236624,It has been known since the 1960s that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; however, their epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades.
32236624,In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies.
32236624,Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus‑associated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID‑19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population.
32236624,Only strong, joint and coordinated efforts of worldwide healthcare systems, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies and receptive national leaders will succeed in suppressing an outbreak of this scale.
32237901,<b>Introduction</b>: At the end of 2019, Wuhan, a city in China with a population of about 11 million, witnessed the outbreak of unusual pneumonia.
32237901,As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide.
32237901,The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness.<b>Areas covered</b>: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19.
32237901,Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19.
32237901,Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19.
32237901,Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19.
32237901,Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation.
32237901,The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.
32238260,The impact caused by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in different parts of the world, currently reaches 745, 308 infected and 35,307 deaths according to the latest reports.
32238260,In this context, in our country, an area of ​​epidemiological relevance is the Peruvian Amazon, due to the distribution of endemic diseases such as metaxemic diseases (Dengue, Malaria, among others), where the problem increases due to the COVID infection. -19 can lead to false positives in Dengue screening tests.
32238260,Thus leading to a delay in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and further spread of the virus, since in most cases of Dengue there are no warning signs and treatment is ambulatory.
32238260,This article seeks to express an opinion on the need to address cases of coinfection between Dengue and Covid-19 in endemic areas.
32238260,El impacto que ha originado la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en diferentes partes del mundo, alcanza en la actualidad 597, 072 personas contagiadas y 27,364 fallecidas según los últimos reportes.
32238260,En ese contexto, en nuestro país, una zona de relevancia epidemiológica es la amazonia peruana, debido a la distribución de enfermedades endémicas como las enfermedades metaxénicas (Dengue, Malaria entre otras), en donde el problema se incrementa debido a que la infección por COVID-19 puede llevar a falsos positivos en las pruebas de cribado para Dengue.
32238260,Conllevando de esa forma a un retraso en el diagnóstico de la infección por COVID-19 y una mayor diseminación del virus, debido a que en la mayor parte de los casos de Dengue no se presentan signos de alarma y el tratamiento es ambulatorio.
32238260,Este artículo busca emitir una opinión sobre la necesidad del abordaje de casos de coinfección entre Dengue y Covid-19 en zonas endémicas.
32238612,First reported in China, the 2019 novel coronavirus has been spreading across the globe.
32238612,Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over.
32238612,The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction.
32238612,Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care.
32238612,Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation.
32238612,Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms.
32238612,Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers.
32238612,Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission.
32238612,Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.
32238757,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China.
32238757,The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002.
32238757,Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level.
32238757,As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed.
32238757,Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective.
32238757,In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19.
32238757,Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.
32239127,In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
32239127,In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).
32239127,All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.
32239127,All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection.
32239127,Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.
32239127,Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.
32239127,The study cohort included 102 adult patients.
32239127,The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female.
32239127,A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.
32239127,Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%).
32239127,Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities.
32239127,They were also less likely suffered from complications.
32239127,There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.
32239127,Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs.
32239127,35.3%).
32239127,Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.
32239127,12.9%).
32239127,The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis.
32239127,Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU.
32239127,Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission.
32239127,There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.
32239446,Human beings have experienced a serious public health event as the new pneumonia (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has killed more than 3000 people in China, most of them elderly or people with underlying chronic diseases or immunosuppressed states.
32239446,Rapid assessment and early warning are essential for outbreak analysis in response to serious public health events.
32239446,This paper reviews the current model analysis methods and conclusions from both micro and macro perspectives.
32239446,The establishment of a comprehensive assessment model, and the use of model analysis prediction, is very efficient for the early warning of infectious diseases.
32239446,This would significantly improve global surveillance capacity, particularly in developing regions, and improve basic training in infectious diseases and molecular epidemiology.
32239761,The clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less understood.
32239761,We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen city, China from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020 and followed until March 6, 2020.
32239761,Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42 (14%) did not have a clear travel history.
32239761,Only 192(64.4%) cases had a fever as the initial symptom.
32239761,Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
32239761,Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition.
32239761,As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%.
32239761,In a designated hospital outside Hubei Province, COVID-2019 patients could be effectively managed by properly using the existing hospital system.
32239761,Mortality may be lowered when cases are relatively mild and there are sufficient medical resources to care and treat the disease.
32240718,In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in China and spread rapidly worldwide.
32240718,It is unknown whether hemodialysis patients represent a distinct group of patients with certain characteristics that may make them susceptible to infection or severe disease.
32240718,In this Case Report, we describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in 201 maintenance hemodialysis patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan university, including 5 maintenance hemodialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 disease.
32240718,Of the 5 patients with COVID-19, one had a definite history of contact with an infected person.
32240718,The age range of the patients was 47-67 years.
32240718,Diarrhea (80%), fever (60%), and fatigue (60%) were the most common symptoms.
32240718,Lymphopenia occurred in all patients.Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans showed ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients.
32240718,Up to February 13, 2020, none of the patients had developed severe complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, multiple organ dysfunction) or died.
32240764,The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help.
32240764,However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data.
32240764,To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study.
32240764,This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan.
32240764,Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic.
32240764,The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women.
32240764,Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy.
32240764,Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified.
32240764,Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions.
32240764,These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.
32240973,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an urgent public health crisis, with epidemiologic models predicting severe consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is permitted to run its course without any intervention or response.
32240973,Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location.
32240973,The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data.
32240973,We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach.
32240973,Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption.
32240973,Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create &quot;checkpoints&quot; for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network.
32240973,Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak.
32240973,Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak.
32240973,This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.
32241316,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, spread rapidly throughout China, and gradually to some countries abroad.
32241316,How to control the development of the epidemic?
32241316,Early diagnosis is one of the important contents in prevention and control.
32241316,COVID-19 patients with early mild pneumonia often lack typical evidence to make a definitive diagnosis.
32241316,Based on the analysis of the cases of 4 patients, this article finds that early diagnosis requires a combination of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, imaging, and etiology, with particular emphasis on epidemiology history and chest CT manifestations.
32241899,To study the GI symptoms in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.
32241899,We analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 95 cases with SARS-CoV-2 caused coronavirus disease 2019.
32241899,Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and GI tissues.
32241899,Among the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation.
32241899,Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively.
32241899,A substantial proportion of patients developed diarrhoea during hospitalisation, potentially aggravated by various drugs including antibiotics.
32241899,Faecal samples of 65 hospitalised patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including 42 with and 23 without GI symptoms, of which 22 (52.4%) and 9 (39.1%) were positive, respectively.
32241899,Six patients with GI symptoms were subjected to endoscopy, revealing oesophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers in one severe patient.
32241899,SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum specimens for both two severe patients.
32241899,In contrast, only duodenum was positive in one of the four non-severe patients.
32241899,GI tract may be a potential transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2.
32243304,Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population.
32243304,The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures.
32243304,Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020.
32243304,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32243304,All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture.
32243304,The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each).
32243304,Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient).
32243304,Lymphopenia (&lt;1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein.
32243304,Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status.
32243304,Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission.
32243304,The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.
32243304,The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32243304,This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32243304,Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.
32243304,Prognostic Level IV.
32243304,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32243599,A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other cities and countries.
32243599,To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020.
32243599,To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated.
32243599,A well-mixed &quot;susceptible exposed infectious recovered&quot; (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority.
32243599,Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention.
32243599,The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.

32244260,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the incidence trend and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province. <b>Methods:</b> The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi.
32244260,Most cases were mild (87.76%).
32244260,As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase.
32244260,The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province.
32244260,The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission.
32244260,The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi.
32244260,After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. <b>Conclusions:</b> At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated.
32244260,However, considering the approaching of return to work and study and the increasing of imported cases from other countries, the prevention and control of COVIS-19 in Shaanxi will face new challenges. <b>目的：</b> 了解陕西省新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的发病趋势及流行特征。
32244260,<b>方法：</b> 收集陕西省截至2020年2月22日COVID-19的疫情数据，进行流行病学描述性分析。
32244260,<b>结果：</b> 陕西省共报告245例COVID-19确诊病例，全省累积报告的确诊病例以轻型、普通型为主（87.76%），随着时间的推移，出现确诊病例的地区不断扩大，以西安市报告病例数最多（占全省报告总病例数近一半）。
32244260,陕西省由输入型病例逐渐转为本地病例为主，而本地病例的传播途径主要以家庭聚集性传播为主。
32244260,陕西省不同来源确诊病例均造成了二代病例传播。
32244260,2月7日之后报告病例数开始波动下降并逐渐趋于平稳，目前陕西省疫情发展处于归零期。
32244260,<b>结论：</b> 陕西省的总体疫情形势已趋向缓和，但考虑到复工返学的到来，同时随着境外输入病例的不断增加，防控工作将面临新的挑战。.
32244261,<b>Objective:</b> To compare the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, and evaluate the effectiveness of their prevention and control measures. <b>Methods:</b> Data of COVID-19 cases reported in Guangzhou and Wenzhou as of 29 February, 2020 were collected.
32244261,The incidence curves of COVID-19 in two cities were constructed.
32244261,The real time reproduction number (<i>R(t)</i>) of COVID-19 in two cities was calculated respectively. <b>Results:</b> A total of 346 and 465 confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, respectively.
32244261,In two cities, most cases were aged 30-59 years (Guangzhou: 54.9%; Wenzhou: 70.3%).
32244261,The incidence curve peaked on 27 January, 2020 in Guangzhou and on 26 January, 2020 in Wenzhou, then began to decline in both cities.
32244261,The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou.
32244261,In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou.
32244261,In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant.
32244261,Despite the different epidemic pattern, the <i>R(t)</i> and the number of COVID-19 cases declined after strict prevention and control measures were taken in Guangzhou and in Wenzhou. <b>Conclusion:</b> The time and scale specific differences of imported COVID-19 resulted in different epidemic patterns in two cities, but the spread of the disease were effectively controlled after taking strict prevention and control measures. <b>目的：</b> 比较广州、温州市两个城市新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的流行模式，并评估两个城市疫情的防控效果。
32244261,<b>方法：</b> 获取截至2020年2月29日广州和温州市两个城市COVID-19确诊病例的个案数据，绘制两个城市疫情的流行曲线，收集不同时间的防控措施，计算在两个城市的实时再生数。
32244261,<b>结果：</b> 广州和温州市分别纳入确诊病例346例和465例，两个城市病例均集中在30～59岁（广州市：54.9%；温州市：70.3%）。
32244261,流行曲线显示广州和温州市的每日发病数分别在1月27日与1月26日到达峰值，随后出现下降趋势。
32244261,两个城市的发病高峰均出现在湖北省的输入病例的抵达高峰后，且温州市的湖北省输入病例的抵达高峰早于广州市。
32244261,广州市一直以输入病例为主，温州市从前期的以输入病例为主转变为后期以本地病例为主。
32244261,虽然两个城市流行模式存在差异，在采取了有力的防控措施后，两个城市均取得了较好的防控效果。
32244261,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19输入疫情可导致两种不同的流行模式，但采取强有力的防控措施，均能有效控制疫情蔓延。.
32244365,As the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread rapidly across the globe, we aimed to identify and summarize the existing evidence on epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of control measures to inform policymakers and leaders in formulating management guidelines, and to provide directions for future research.
32244365,We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak following predefined eligibility criteria.
32244365,Of 317 research articles generated from our initial search on PubMed and preprint archives on 21 February 2020, 41 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review.
32244365,Current evidence suggests that it takes about 3-7 days for the epidemic to double in size.
32244365,Of 21 estimates for the basic reproduction number ranging from 1.9 to 6.5, 13 were between 2.0 and 3.0.
32244365,The incubation period was estimated to be 4-6 days, whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 4-8 days.
32244365,Though the true case fatality risk is yet unknown, current model-based estimates ranged from 0.3% to 1.4% for outside China.
32244365,There is an urgent need for rigorous research focusing on the mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on society.
32245395,In this Commentary, we would like to comment on the article titled &quot;A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)&quot; as a featured article in Military Medical Research.
32245395,In the guideline, except for &quot;confirmed cases&quot;, &quot;suspected cases&quot;, &quot;close contact&quot; and &quot;suspicious exposure&quot; were defined by clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and auxiliary examination.
32245395,Combined with our experience, we introduced a simple scoring proposal additionally based on not only CT imaging as strongly recommended by the guideline but also blood routine test, especially for primary screening of such patients in the out-patient department.
32246819,BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the imaging manifestations of early-stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to provide imaging basis for early detection of suspected cases and stratified intervention.
32246819,MATERIAL AND METHODS From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital.
32246819,These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19.
32246819,All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records.
32246819,RESULTS CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected.
32246819,Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement.
32246819,Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions.
32246819,There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle.
32246819,Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign,1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign.
32246819,CONCLUSIONS The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses.
32246819,Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.
32246890,Respiratory protective devices are critical in protecting against infection in health care workers at high risk of novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, recommendations are conflicting and epidemiological data on their relative effectiveness against COVID-19 are limited.
32246890,To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in health care workers.
32246890,MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL from January 1<sup>st</sup>  2014 to March 9<sup>th</sup> 2020.
32246890,Update of published search conducted from January 1<sup>st</sup>  1990 to December 9<sup>th</sup>  2014.
32246890,Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in health care workers.
32246890,Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence.
32246890,Four RCTs were meta-analysed adjusting for clustering.
32246890,Compared to N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I<sup>2</sup> =0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95%CI 0.98-2.28; I<sup>2</sup> =78%; very low certainty in the evidence).
32246890,Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (p=0.49).
32246890,Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence.
32246890,Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health care workers during non-aerosol generating care.
32246890,Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.
32246905,The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same.
32246905,However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases.
32246905,Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32246905,We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore.
32246905,We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.
32246905,The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity.
32246905,This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5-4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore.
32246905,Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity.
32246905,Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.
32246905,Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold.
32246905,Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates.
32246905,Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

32247050,The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat.
32247050,Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
32247050,Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
32247050,The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin.
32247050,The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS.
32247050,Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems.
32247050,Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).
32247050,The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.
32247326,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China.
32247326,Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.
32247326,We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020.
32247326,We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset.
32247326,We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals.
32247326,We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) at the provincial level.
32247326,We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces.
32247326,The median age of cases was 44 years (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged &gt;64 years) as the epidemic progressed.
32247326,The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0-14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0-9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17.
32247326,The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8-12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3-11·6).
32247326,The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission.
32247326,We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74-1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32-2·17) in Shandong province.
32247326,In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, &lt;1) after Jan 30.
32247326,Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms.
32247326,Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community.
32247326,Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

32247826,With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a worldwide health concern.
32247826,One previous study reported a family cluster with asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19.
32247826,Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers.
32247826,A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital.
32247826,We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families.
32247826,Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan.
32247826,Additionally, two family members, those who had not travelled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members.
32247826,Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU.
32247826,Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days 2 through 3 of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs.
32247826,Case 4 presented with diarrhoea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities.
32247826,Case 2 presented no clinical or radiographic abnormalities.
32247826,All the cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein.
32247826,Our findings indicate that COVID-19 can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period.
32247926,In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) arrived in Bolivia.
32247926,Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia.
32247926,For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs.
32247926,Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR.
32247926,The median age was 39 years (IQR 25-43), six of them male.
32247926,Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain.
32247926,Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms.
32247926,Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized.
32247926,None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group.
32247926,This is the first report of surveillance of COVID-19 in Bolivia, with patients managed mainly with home isolation.
32247926,Preparedness for a significant epidemic, as is going on in other countries, and the deployment of response plans for it, in the country is now taking place to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population.
32249089,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel and lethal infectious disease, posing a threat to global health security.
32249089,The number of cases has increased rapidly, but no data concerning kidney transplant (KTx) recipients infected with COVID-19 are available.
32249089,To present the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of KTx recipients infected with COVID-19, we report on a case series of five patients who were confirmed as having COVID-19 through nucleic acid testing (NAT) from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020.
32249089,The most common symptoms on admission to hospital were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%); serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset.
32249089,Four patients received a reduced dose of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy during hospitalization.
32249089,As of March 4, 2020 NAT was negative for COVID-19 in three patients twice in succession, and their computed tomography scans showed improved images.
32249089,Although greater patient numbers and long-term follow-up data are needed, our series demonstrates that mild COVID-19 infection in KTx recipients can be managed using symptomatic support therapy combined with adjusted maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.
32249952,This study seeks to examine and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks and identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and changing trends of cases.
32249952,Hence, local outlier analysis and emerging spatiotemporal hot spot analysis were performed to analyze the spatiotemporal clustering pattern and cold\hot spot trends of COVID-19 cases based on space-time cube during the period from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020.
32249952,The main findings are as follows.
32249952,1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased.
32249952,2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven.
32249952,In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city.
32249952,Those regions are continuously in the hot spot on the spatiotemporal tendency.
32249952,3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the space-time cube can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space-time.
32249952,Therefore, the Chinese government should strengthen the prevention and control efforts in a targeted manner to cope with a highly changeable situation.

32250505,The emergence of the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic called coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has become one of the most significant challenges to the healthcare profession.
32250505,Dental practices are focal points for cross-infection, and care must be taken to minimise the risk of infection to, from, or between dental care professionals and patients.
32250505,The COVID-19 epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience.
32250505,It is unknown whether certain groups, for example children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness.
32250505,Emerging data on disease spread in children, affected by COVID-19, have not been presented in detail.
32250505,The purpose of this article was to report current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID-19 and highlight considerations for dentists providing care for children during this pandemic.
32250505,All members of the dental team have a professional responsibility to keep themselves informed of current guidance and be vigilant in updating themselves as recommendations are changing so quickly.
32250957,Infodemiology, i.e. information epidemiology, uses Web-based data in order to inform public health and policy.
32250957,Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully employed in order to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks.
32250957,In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that started in Wuhan, China, in 2019, in this report online search traffic data from Google are used aiming at tracking the spread of the new Coronavirus.
32250957,Time-series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the topic of &quot;Coronavirus&quot; are retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European countries that have been affected the most; Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the UK.
32250957,Statistically significant correlations are observed between the online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths.
32250957,Furthermore, a critical point after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still is statistically significant) is identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not peaked in COVID-19 cases yet.
32250957,In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in specific, have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, as, for example, in the cases of MERS, Ebola, measles, and Zika.
32250957,With the COVID-19 pandemic still at the beginning, it is essential to explore and combine new methods of disease surveillance, in order to assist with the preparedness of the respective health care systems at regional level.
32250962,During the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), internet hospitals in China were engaged with epidemic prevention and control, offering epidemic-related online services and medical support to the public.
32250962,The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
32250962,Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected.
32250962,The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups.
32250962,Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19.
32250962,Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees' group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors.
32250962,The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for an offline visit were compared.
32250962,Risk factors affecting the counselees' tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models.
32250962,The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed.
32250962,A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years).
32250962,There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees.
32250962,A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19.
32250962,The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common.
32250962,The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P&lt;.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors.
32250962,Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P&lt;.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P&lt;.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P&lt;.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion.
32250962,Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P&lt;.001), fever (OR 1.660, P&lt;.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P&lt;.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit.
32250962,Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic.
32250962,Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.
32251796,From 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found 2 asymptomatic infections.
32251796,One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment.
32251796,Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his TR-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day.
32251796,We found that there may be virus carriers in asymptomatic population with epidemiological contact history.
32251796,After 14 days of isolation, asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means the risk of transmission and present a new challenge to home isolation.
32252338,The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32252338,Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed.
32252338,This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk.
32252338,Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections.
32252338,Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
32252338,Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.
32252338,Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.
32252338,To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.
32252338,The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L).
32252338,For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D<sub>3</sub> doses might be useful.
32252338,Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.
32252845,On Tuesday 17th March 2020 at noon, France became the third European country to impose a nationwide containment policy in the fight against epidemic COVID-19 viral infection.
32252845,Announcing that the country was at &quot;war&quot;, President Macron called upon all to play a role in mitigating against further development of contagion.
32252845,This extreme measure never seen before during peace time was the result of adapting not only the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP) being applied to the national context but also real-time clinical, epidemiological and scientific information about the evolution of COVID-19 infection in the country.
32252845,The situation was further complicated by local municipal elections and political agendas by populist opinions.
32252845,Despite mass communication about the importance of individual behavioral attitudes to counter disease propagation, few heeded government advice.
32252845,Consequently, the situation rapidly deteriorated with increasing number of cases that started to overwhelm health services.
32252845,As a result, decisive and immediate action was taken by the State for the national public health interest.
32252845,This report from the field details the timely events which contributed to this extreme policy decision taken by France.
32252845,A policy decision which other western democracies have since applied as the pandemic disseminated across the globe.
32253535,To investigate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32253535,Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals.
32253535,The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms.
32253535,Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS).
32253535,A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females).
32253535,The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite.
32253535,Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms.
32253535,85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively.
32253535,There was a significant association between both disorders (p &lt; 0.001).
32253535,Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases.
32253535,The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001).
32253535,Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic.
32253535,The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%.
32253535,Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001).
32253535,Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms.
32253535,The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.
32255183,To control the spread of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), China sealed Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020 and soon expanded lockdown to other twelve cities in Hubei province.
32255183,We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics in one of the cities and highlight the effect of current implemented lockdown and nonpharmaceutical interventions.
32255183,We retrieved data of reported cases in Huangshi and Wuhan from publicly available disease databases.
32255183,Local epidemiological data on suspected or confirmed cases in Huangshi were collected through field investigation.
32255183,Epidemic curves were constructed with data on reported and observed cases.
32255183,The accumulated confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatality in Huangshi were reported to be 1015 and 3.74% respectively, compared with 50006 and 5.08% in Wuhan till Mar 27, 2020.
32255183,Right after Jan 24, the epidemic curve based on observed cases in Huangshi became flattened.
32255183,Feb 1, 2020 was identified as the &quot;turning point&quot; as the epidemic in Huangshi faded soon afterwards.
32255183,COVID-19 epidemic was characterized by mild cases in Huangshi, accounting for 82.66% of total cases.
32255183,Moreover, 50 asymptomatic infections were identified in adults and children.
32255183,Besides, we found confirmed cases in 19 familial clusters and 21 health care workers, supporting inter-human transmission.
32255183,Our study reported the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Huangshi city, China, across the unprecedented intervention.
32255183,Such new epidemiological inference might provide further guidance on current lockdown measures in high-risk cities and, subsequently, help improve public health intervention strategies against the pandemic on the country and global levels.
32255761,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic.
32255761,Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) of 2.2-2.7.
32255761,We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period.
32255761,We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data.
32255761,Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days.
32255761,Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R<sub>0</sub> value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9).
32255761,We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.
32257173,On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology.
32257173,Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered.
32257173,Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action.
32257173,In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
32257173,Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak.
32257173,Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting.
32257173,Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed.
32257173,In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review.
32257173,From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology.
32257173,For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled.
32257173,Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols.
32257173,Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.
32257728,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic.
32257728,Compared to adults, there has been a significantly smaller number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, although the incidence is increasing every day.
32257728,This article looks to review specific epidemiological factors, symptomatology, laboratory and imaging workup, and other relevant metrics derived from the limited published literature that are specific to the pediatric population, to provide a review for the pediatric practitioner and guide, in part, the creation of a clinical algorithm for the management of COVID-19 in the pediatric population that can be utilized by pediatric institutions.

32259130,There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 as a new emerging epidemic.
32259130,In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable.
32259130,However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic.
32259130,Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities.
32259403,Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, but information about children with COVID-19 is limited.
32259403,This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China.
32259403,We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha.
32259403,Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed.
32259403,Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020.
32259403,By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha.
32259403,Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days.
32259403,The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms.
32259403,Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan.
32259403,As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged.
32259403,The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days.
32259403,The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients.
32259403,Children who have a familial clustering or have a family member with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.
32259829,In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
32259829,A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No.
32259829,MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community.
32259829,This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
32259829,SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus.
32259829,Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies.
32259829,In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.
32259829,Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies.
32259829,Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures.
32264802,This is the ninth epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reported in Australia as at 23:59 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 29 March 2020.
32264802,It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence.
32265115,The infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the dimension of a pandemic, affecting more than 160 countries in a few weeks.
32265115,In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected.
32265115,For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1), the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively.
32265115,These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries.
32265115,These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32265115,Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.
32267220,A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic.
32267220,Although molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed.
32267220,Validated serologic assays are needed for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir, and epidemiologic studies.
32267220,We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein-specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies.
32267220,Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs.
32267220,We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset.
32267220,We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity, and sensitivity varied between the 2 assays; the IgA ELISA showed higher sensitivity.
32267220,Overall, the validated assays described can be instrumental for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiologic, and vaccine evaluation studies.
32268195,A novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, and human-to-human transmission was previously identified.
32268195,This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics in Jiangsu Province and assess whether so-called wartime control measures changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province.
32268195,Epidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020.
32268195,The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613.
32268195,The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases.
32268195,The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9.
32268195,The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%-58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined.
32268195,The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17.
32268195,The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou.
32268195,The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people).
32268195,The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province.
32268195,The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.
32268195,The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined.
32268195,This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.
32268622,During a short period of time, the COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus and first reported by the end of the year 2019 in China, has spread rapidly to many countries and regions outside China.
32268622,The number of confirmed cases and deaths continued to rise.
32268622,World Health Organization announced that the outbreaks of the novel coronavirus infection have constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32268622,Efficient infection control can prevent the virus from further spreading, which may make the pandemic situation under control.
32268622,Due to the specialty of oral healthcare settings, the risk of cross infection is severe among patients and oral healthcare workers.
32268622,It's urgent to implement more strict and efficient infection control protocols.
32268622,This article, based on existing guidelines and published researches pertinent to dental infection-control principles and practices, mainly discusses epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and the features of nosocomial infection in oral healthcare settings, and furthermore provides recommendations on patient's evaluation, and infection control protocols in departments of stomatology under current circumstance.
32268622,新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情在短期内扩散至全球多个国家和地区，确诊和死亡病例数持续上升，成为被世界卫生组织认定的&quot;国际关注的突发公共卫生事件&quot;。
32268622,正确的防控措施可以阻断新型冠状病毒在医院内的传播，降低感染风险，有效防止疫情进一步扩散。
32268622,口腔专业因诊疗操作的特殊性，交叉感染的风险较高，严格的防控措施尤其重要。
32268622,本文从新型冠状病毒的流行病学特点、口腔诊疗医院感染特点、患者评估以及诊疗操作和环境的防控等方面进行阐述，并提出相应的建议。.
32268633,COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the country, and the prevention and control of the epidemic has entered a critical period.
32268633,However, southern cities with severe outbreaks are about to enter the seasonal influenza season.
32268633,We should strengthen the epidemiological investigation, optimize the laboratory testing strategy, take effective measures, strengthen the prevention and control of influenza epidemic, and minimize the interference to the COVID-19 epidemic.
32268633,新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情在全国持续蔓延，疫情防控进入关键时期。
32268633,然而，目前疫情严重的南方城市即将进入季节性流感高发季节。
32268633,要加强流行病学调查，优化实验室检测策略，采取有效措施，加大流感疫情防控力度，最大限度减少对新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控的干扰。.
32268855,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 5 April 2020: Notifications = 5,805; Deaths = 33.
32268855,Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
32268855,Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically link.
32268855,The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
32268855,Early indications are that reduction in international travel, domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action are slowing the spread of the disease.
32268855,Internationally, cases continue to increase, with high rates of increase observed in the European region and the United States of America.
32268855,The epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.
32269893,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic.
32269893,There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization.
32269893,A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media.
32269893,This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments.
32269893,The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice.
32269893,Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2.
32269893,Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated.
32269893,Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19.
32269893,These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment.
32269893,Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated.
32269893,Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified.
32269893,Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described.
32269893,Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed.
32269893,The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis.
32269893,Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented.
32269893,Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed.
32269893,The composite collection of accredited studies on each of these subtopics of COVID-19 within this review will enable clarification and focus on the current status and direction in the planning of the management of this global pandemic.
32270371,In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China.
32270371,Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide.
32270371,The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32270371,This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified.
32270371,The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.
32270371,The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces.
32270371,As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702.
32270371,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32270371,The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities.
32270371,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
32270371,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.
32270371,WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.
32270413,Clinical and epidemiological knowledge of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited.
32270413,We reported a family cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Beijing, China.
32270413,This family comprised three laboratory confirmed cases with clinical symptoms.
32270413,All three patients had close contact with a relative from Wuhan, Hubei Province.
32270413,Throat swab samples were all positive for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays.
32270413,Chest computerized tomography revealed ground-glass opacities and consolidation.
32270413,SARS-CoV-2 infections tend to clusters.
32270413,Physicians should be aware of contact history so that infected patients can be identified promptly and further spreading prevented.
32271460,On December 8, 2019, many cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology were first reported in Wuhan, China, subsequently identified as a novel coronavirus infection aroused worldwide concern.
32271460,As the outbreak is ongoing, more and more researchers focused interest on the COVID-19.
32271460,Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the publications about COVID-19 to summarize the research hotspots and make a review, to provide reference for researchers in the world.
32271460,We conducted a search in PubMed using the keywords &quot;COVID-19&quot; from inception to March 1, 2020.
32271460,Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus. 183 publications published from 2020 January 14 to 2020 February 29 were included in the study.
32271460,The first corresponding authors of the publications were from 20 different countries.
32271460,Among them, 78 (42.6%) from the hospital, 64 (35%) from the university and 39 (21.3%) from the research institution.
32271460,All the publications were published in 80 different journals.
32271460,Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n=25).
32271460,60 (32.8%) were original research, 29 (15.8%) were review, 20 (10.9%) were short communications.
32271460,68 (37.2%) epidemiology, 49 (26.8%) virology and 26 (14.2%) clinical features.
32271460,According to our review, China has provided a large number of research data for various research fields, during the outbreak of COVID-19.
32271460,Most of the findings play an important role in preventing and controlling the epidemic around the world.
32271460,With research on the COVID-19 still booming, new vaccine and effective medicine for COVID-19 will be expected to come out in the near future with the joint efforts of researchers worldwide.
32271597,The rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions.
32271597,The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model.
32271597,The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020.
32271597,By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran.
32271597,Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models.
32271597,All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package.
32271597,Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020.
32271597,On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran.
32271597,The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases.
32271597,The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.
32271601,Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China.
32271601,Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO).
32271601,COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus.
32271601,The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast.
32271601,Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy.
32271601,In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care.
32271601,Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32271601,The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection.
32271601,In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.
32271602,In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which has subsequently affected more than 200 countries worldwide including Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and other places.
32271602,The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing.
32271602,To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China.
32271602,To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19.
32271602,Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020.
32271602,Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed.
32271602,The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results.
32271602,Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 ± 11.32, 5 males).
32271602,No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P &gt; 0.05).
32271602,No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P &lt; 0.05).
32271602,Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc.
32271602,The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas.
32271602,Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.
32271722,Presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might pose challenges for disease control.
32271722,The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was detected on January 23, 2020, and by March 16, a total of 243 cases had been confirmed, including 157 locally acquired cases.
32271722,Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred.
32271722,Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19.
32271722,Seven COVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases.
32271722,In the four clusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient.
32271722,To account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset.
32271722,Evidence of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the critical role social distancing, including avoidance of congregate settings, plays in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
32271724,On February 27, 2020, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) identified its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with probable community transmission (i.e., infection among persons without a known exposure by travel or close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19).
32271724,At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1).
32271724,To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County.
32271724,During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites.
32271724,For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers.
32271724,A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
32271724,Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza.
32271724,Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection.
32271724,This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County.
32271724,As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies.
32271724,Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2).
32271724,Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.
32272173,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has focused attention on the need to develop effective therapies against the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, and also against other pathogenic coronaviruses (CoV) that have emerged in the past or might appear in future.
32272173,Researchers are therefore focusing on steps in the CoV replication cycle that may be vulnerable to inhibition by broad-spectrum or specific antiviral agents.
32272173,The conserved nature of the fusion domain and mechanism across the CoV family make it a valuable target to elucidate and develop pan-CoV therapeutics.
32272173,In this article, we review the role of the CoV spike protein in mediating fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, summarizing the results of research on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and recent peer-reviewed studies of SARS-CoV-2, and suggest that the fusion mechanism be investigated as a potential antiviral target.
32272173,We also provide a supplemental file containing background information on the biology, epidemiology, and clinical features of all human-infecting coronaviruses, along with a phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses.
32272262,A pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently emerged in China.
32272262,It was recognized as a global health hazard. 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included.
32272262,Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded, and ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified.
32272262,Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated.
32272262,Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history.
32272262,Fever and cough were main symptoms.
32272262,Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes.
32272262,GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping.
32272262,There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups.
32272262,The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P&lt;0.05).
32272262,A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P&lt;0.05).
32272262,Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
32272262,While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32272857,In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide.
32272857,As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside.
32272857,Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general.
32272857,This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including <i>in vitro</i> model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery.
32272857,COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need.
32272857,Impact statement Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks.
32272857,Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks.
32272857,Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside.
32272857,In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.
32273156,The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease has gripped the entire international community and caused widespread public health concerns.
32273156,Despite global efforts to contain the disease spread, the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection.
32273156,This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins and later transmitted to humans.
32273156,Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature.
32273156,Dental professionals, including endodontists, may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection.
32273156,Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection.
32273156,In addition, specific recommendations for dental practice are suggested for patient screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.
32274081,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, coincided with <i>chunyun</i>, the period of mass migration for the annual Spring Festival.
32274081,To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020.
32274081,These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases.
32274081,However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic.
32274081,We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic.
32274081,We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve.
32274081,We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic.
32274081,We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April.
32274081,A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold.
32274081,Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction.
32274081,Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes.
32274081,The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.
32274617,SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19), is taking the globe by storm, approaching 500,000 confirmed cases and over 21,000 deaths as of March 25, 2020.
32274617,While under control in some affected Asian countries (Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam), the virus demonstrated an exponential phase of infectivity in several large countries (China in late January and February and many European countries and the USA in March), with cases exploding by 30-50,000/day in the third and fourth weeks of March, 2020.
32274617,SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be particularly deadly to older adults and those with certain underlying medical conditions, many of whom are of advanced age.
32274617,Here, we briefly review the virus, its structure and evolution, epidemiology and pathogenesis, immunogenicity and immune, and clinical response in older adults, using available knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its highly pathogenic relatives MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1.
32274617,We conclude by discussing clinical and basic science approaches to protect older adults against this disease.
32275259,The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that started in Wuhan, China, has now spread to several other countries and is in its exponential phase of spread.
32275259,Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many countries.
32275259,Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavirus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively.
32275259,Since the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities.
32275259,So, this review aims at understanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses.
32275259,Studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses.
32275259,The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses.
32275259,So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV.
32275261,Public Health professionals and academics have been on the frontline of Italian history during the COVID-19 response like they never did before.
32275261,Ancient professors of Hygiene such as Celli, Pagliani, Sclavo, Petragnani, Seppilli and Giovanardi flanked politicians in other critical moments.
32275261,They helped them to manage healthcare reforms, earthquakes response, Seveso Dioxin disaster, cholera and poliomielitis epidemics and other health threats.
32275261,The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the paramount importance of the practical application of basic concepts of public health, which were considered so far became obsolete, such as personal hygiene, quarantine, individual protective devices or basic epidemiological measures.
32275261,Hygiene and Public Health used to have a targeted audience in professionals and lecturers.
32275261,Nowadays, these topics are critical and of concern of a much larger audience.
32275261,Public Health women and men are now asked to act in task forces, media broadcasts, webinars and consulting activities.
32275261,In phase 2 of this epidemic - which is about to begin when this volume is to be published - the role of Public Health professionals could become even more relevant.
32275261,However, this unexpected season must be managed with seriousness and intelligence, capitalizing it also for the future.
32275261,If our Post-Graduate Schools of Public Health (&quot;Igiene e Medicina Preventiva&quot;), our scientific associations, our academic lecturers and our officers do not prove to be up to the situation, a dull future for the discipline might very well be.
32275261,On the contrary, if as we all hope, we will be able to ride the wave of a dramatic health crisis, transforming it into a relevant scientific and professional opportunity, then we will be able to build on the post-COVID-19 a cutting-edge, a more attractive, relevant and modern discipline.
32275261,This Supplement of Acta Biomedica, planned before the onset of the epidemic emergency in Italy, but already successful in presenting two papers on COVID-19, is further proof of how current and lively our discipline is.
32275295,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak.
32275295,To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions.
32275295,In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification.
32275295,Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey.
32275295,Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey).
32275295,The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods.
32275295,Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women.
32275295,The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase.
32275295,The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]).
32275295,The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods.
32275295,The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (&lt;20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]).
32275295,The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.
32275295,A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.
32275295,These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
32276333,The pandemic novel coronavirus infection, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected at least 190 countries or territories, with 465,915 confirmed cases and 21,031 deaths.
32276333,In a containment-based strategy, rapid, sensitive and specific testing is important in epidemiological control and clinical management.
32276333,Using 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes and our in-house program, GolayMetaMiner, four specific regions longer than 50 nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified.
32276333,Primers were designed to target the longest and previously untargeted nsp2 region and optimized as a probe-free real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.
32276333,The new COVID-19-nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL and did not amplify other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses.
32276333,Assay reproducibility in terms of cycle threshold (Cp) values was satisfactory, with the total imprecision (% CV) values well below 5%.
32276333,Evaluation of the new assay using 59 clinical specimens from 14 confirmed cases showed 100% concordance with our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel reference assay.
32276333,A rapid, sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR assay, COVID-19-nsp2, was developed.
32276848,To determine the dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32276848,From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China.
32276848,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected.
32276848,Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored.
32276848,Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks.
32276848,Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days.
32276848,SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system.
32276848,Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites.
32276848,Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.
32278065,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency.
32278065,An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported.
32278065,Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea.
32278065,We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32278065,Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.
32278065,It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms.
32278065,A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%.
32278065,SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
32278065,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia.
32278065,ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon.
32278065,SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.
32278065,Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs.
32278065,Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation.
32278065,Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32278065,Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms.
32278065,The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.
32278758,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread outside the initial epicenter of Wuhan.
32278758,We compared cases in Guangzhou and Wuhan to illustrate potential changes in pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics as the epidemic has progressed.
32278758,We studied 20 patients admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China from January 22 to February 12, 2020.
32278758,Data were extracted from medical records.
32278758,These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020.
32278758,Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients.
32278758,The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%).
32278758,Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more clustered.
32278758,Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces.
32278758,Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients.
32278758,This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission.
32278758,Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices.
32281124,Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic of respiratory illness, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[
32281124,1] The risk of developing COVID-19 from a SARS-CoV-2 infected organ donor is unknown.
32281124,Therefore, extreme caution is necessary when considering transplantation.
32281124,Transmission is affected by epidemiological risk factors, incubation period, degree of viraemia, and viability of SARS-CoV-2 in blood and organ compartments.
32281124,Recent guidelines from NHSBT[2] recommend that all potential donors be tested for SARS-CoV-2 and donation suspended from those who test positive.
32281124,Donation is discouraged for asymptomatic individuals who have been in a COVID-19-affected area in the last 28 days.
32281481,As a result of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), there has been an urgent worldwide demand for treatments.
32281481,Due to factors such as history of prescription for other infectious diseases, availability, and relatively low cost, the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tested <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> for the ability to inhibit the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32281481,However, even though investigators noted the therapeutic potential of these drugs, it is important to consider the toxicological risks and necessary care for rational use of CQ and HCQ.
32281481,This study provides information on the main toxicological and epidemiological aspects to be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 using CQ but mainly HCQ, which is a less toxic derivative than CQ, and was shown to produce better results in inhibiting proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 based upon preliminary tests.
32283139,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an epidemic in China and many other countries.
32283139,Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited.
32283139,In this retrospective case series, we enrolled 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their household members in Wuhan.
32283139,Patients were confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on throat swabs.
32283139,Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of the household members were collected.
32283139,There were 155 close contacts in total. 104 contacts received RT-PCR assays, with 47 (30%) positive cases and 57 (37%) negative cases. 51 (33%) cases did not received RT-PCR tests for they showed no symptoms of pneumonia during the 2 weeks of quarantine.
32283139,The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts.
32283139,The rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 30%.
32283139,Our data provide insight into the rate of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in home.
32283894,Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic spreading in most countries including Turkey.
32283894,The current knowledge of COVID-19 and the virus causing it, SARS-CoV-2, was reviewed.
32283894,The epidemiology and control in different countries was compared and the differences discussed.
32283894,The population attack rates and case fatality rates vary from country to country with Lombardy in northern Italy reporting an attack rate in the general population of 0.37% compared to 0.004% in Hong Kong.
32283894,The differences are caused by different testing strategies and reporting systems.
32283894,Turkey is early in the outbreak.
32283894,Different control strategies are available with South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore being models to follow.
32284613,We report epidemiological and clinical investigations on ten pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection cases confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
32284613,Symptoms in these cases were nonspecific and no children required respiratory support or intensive care.
32284613,Chest X-rays lacked definite signs of pneumonia, a defining feature of the infection in adult cases.
32284613,Notably, eight children persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, raising the possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
32285862,On December 31, 2019, the Chinese health authorities informed the international community, through the mechanisms established by the World Health Organization (WHO), of a pneumonia epidemic of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
32285862,The first cases were reported early in that month and were linked to a history of having visited a market where food and live animals are sold.
32285862,On January 7, 2020, isolation and identification of the culprit pathogen was achieved using next-generation sequencing, while the number of affected subjects continued to rise.
32285862,The publication of full-genomes of the newly identified coronavirus (initially called 2019-nCoV, now called SARS-CoV2) in public and private databases, of standardized diagnostic protocols and of the clinical-epidemiological information generated will allow addressing the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), declared on January 30 by the WHO.
32285862,With this document, we intend to contribute to the characterization of the pneumonia epidemic, now designated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) review the strengths Mexico has in the global health concert and invite health professionals to join the preparedness and response activities in the face of this emergency.
32285862,El 31 de diciembre de 2019, las autoridades chinas de salud informaron a la comunidad internacional, a través de los mecanismos establecidos por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), de una epidemia de neumonía con etiología desconocida en Wuhan, provincia de Hubei.
32285862,Los primeros casos se notificaron a inicios de ese mes y se vincularon al antecedente de visitar un mercado de comida y animales vivos.
32285862,El 7 de enero de 2020 se logró el aislamiento y reconocimiento del patógeno responsable mediante secuenciación de siguiente generación, mientras el número de afectados continuaba en ascenso.
32285862,La publicación de genomas completos del nuevo coronavirus identificado (inicialmente denominado 2019-nCoV, ahora designado SARS-CoV2) en bases de datos públicas y privadas, de protocolos diagnósticos estandarizados y de la información clínica epidemiológica generada permitirá atender la Emergencia de Salud Pública de Importancia Internacional (ESPII) declarada el 30 de enero por la OMS.
32285862,Con este documento pretendemos aportar a la caracterización de la epidemia de neumonía, ahora llamada enfermedad por coronavirus (Covid-19), revisar las fortalezas que tiene México en el concierto de la salud global e invitar a los profesionales de la salud a incorporarse a las actividades de preparación y respuesta ante esta emergencia.
32286766,The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its infection, COVID-19, has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, travel, and commerce.
32286766,It is essential for emergency clinicians to learn as much as possible about this pandemic to manage the unprecedented burdens on healthcare providers and hospital systems.
32286766,This review analyzes information from worldwide research and experience on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19, and offers links to the most reliable and trustworthy resources to help equip healthcare professionals in managing this public health challenge.
32286766,As the pandemic sweeps the United States, lessons learned from early centers of infection, notably New York and Northern Italy, can help localities to prepare.
32288414,During the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemiological data is essential for controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations.
32288414,Following Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier.
32288414,As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named &quot;one-net management&quot; on dynamic information monitoring.
32288414,By sharing epidemiological data with medical institutions under a safe environment, we believe that the ability to prevent and control epidemics among medical institutions will be effectively and comprehensively improved.
32289565,To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China.
32289565,In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological findings of patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 People's Hospital of Fuyang City from Jan 20 to Feb 9, 2020.
32289565,Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020.
32289565,Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8%) were male.
32289565,Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)].
32289565,Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients.
32289565,100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.
32289565,All patients were given antiviral therapy.
32289565,19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit.
32289565,By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died.
32289565,Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16).
32289565,In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom.
32289565,Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition.
32289565,Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.
32290293,The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy.
32290293,Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking.
32290293,In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.
32290293,We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation.
32290293,We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
32290293,Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety.
32290293,On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety.
32290293,These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses.
32290293,The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including <i>favipiravir</i>, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and <i>hydroxychloroquine</i>, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway.
32290293,We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.
32290644,COVID-19 has now become a pandemic.
32290644,It has spread from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 to a large number of countries within three months.
32290644,The objective of this work is to report the initial experience with epidemiologic and clinical features, as well as with the management of COVID-19 patients in India.
32290644,This is a descriptive case series of the first 21 COVID-19 infected patients confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and admitted to a tertiary care centre in India from 01.02.2020 to 19.03.2020.
32290644,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including age, sex, nationality, travel history, symptoms, duration of stay, and comorbidities.
32290644,The mean age of the population was 40.3 years with a male preponderance.
32290644,Thirteen (62%) patients had recent travel history outside India in the previous 30 days, two thirds of whom had travelled to Italy.
32290644,The most common symptoms were fever and cough (42.9%) followed by sore throat, headache and breathlessness.
32290644,Vital and laboratory parameters were preserved in all patients and none of them required ventilatory support.
32290644,Among the first 21 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in India, the typical clinical presentation consisted in a mild upper respiratory tract infection predominantly affecting the young male population.
32290644,One patient required supplemental oxygen.
32290644,All patients recovered with no residual symptoms.

32291542,In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32291542,On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in the throat swab sample of one patient.
32291542,The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32291542,Currently, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries.
32291542,China, with a huge burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve the curative rate of COVID-19.
32291542,In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.
32291542,A comprehensive understanding will help to control the disease.
32292205,Since December 2019, increasing cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being detected worldwide.
32292205,The purpose of this paper is to provide a scientific reference for the global prevention and control of COVID-19.
32292205,General demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were collected that had been reported on the websites of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China.
32292205,We herein describe distributions in time, place, and population of COVID-19.
32292205,As of midnight on February 10, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was 42,638, and the province with the largest number of confirmed cases was Hubei (31728), followed by Guangdong (1177), Zhejiang (1117), and Henan (1105) province.
32292205,The number of cases and the speed of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei were more moderate than those of the Hubei province.
32292205,The median (interquartile range) age of 1740 patients with COVID-19 was 44 (33, 54) years, with a range of 10 months to 89 years.
32292205,The COVID-19 epidemic should be considered a global threat and the steps for control include early diagnosis and treatment, as well as isolation.
32292261,The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to international health system and economy.
32292261,This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.
32292261,The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes.
32292261,The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks.
32292261,The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19.
32292261,During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%.
32292261,The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age.
32292261,The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12.
32292261,There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R<sup>2</sup>=0.996).
32292261,The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide.
32292261,It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends.
32292261,The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe.
32292261,However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.
32292587,Corona virus disease 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic virus causing a variety of severe of respiratory diseases.
32292587,SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in structure.
32292587,The highly prevalence of COVID-19 is due to the lack onset of symptoms.
32292587,Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.
32292587,Conduct the differences of whole genome sequence and some viral proteins to determine the gap and the change alternation of nucleotides and amino acids sequences.
32292587,We evaluate 11 complete genome sequence of different coronavirus using BAST and MAFFT software.
32292587,We also selected 7 types of structural proteins.
32292587,We were conclude that COVID-19 might be created new mutations specifically in glycoproteins hence requires caution and complete preparation by health authorities.
32292637,This article summarizes the experience in the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) epidemic in non-isolated areas in a general hospital.
32292637,Based on refined management theory, we professionally developed the standards for prevention and control of COVID-19 in non-isolated areas, systematically implemented various prevention and control measures, performed gridding audit, effectively communicated among teams and between doctors and patients assisted by information techniques, and reported results for quality improvement.
32292637,There was no hospital acquired COVID-19 infections among staff in the hospital.
32292637,The rates of mask wearing, epidemiological history screening and the medical supplies disinfection were all 100% in the hospital.
32292637,The accuracy rate of mask wearing of patients and their families was 73.79% and the compliance of their hand hygiene was 40.78%.
32292637,Refined management strategies for the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection in non-isolated areas of the general hospital are effective.
32292637,The accuracy rate of mask wearing and hand hygiene compliance of patients and their families need to be further improved.
32292686,In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China.
32292686,Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide.
32292686,The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32292686,This appears to be a virus from <i>Rhinolophus</i> bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified.
32292686,The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.
32292686,The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces.
32292686,As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702.
32292686,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32292686,The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities.
32292686,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
32292686,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.
32292686,WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.
32292848,The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), has reached pandemic status.
32292848,As it spreads across the world, it has overwhelmed healthcare systems, strangled the global economy and led to a devastating loss of life.
32292848,Widespread efforts from regulators, clinicians and scientists are driving a rapid expansion of knowledge of the SARS-CoV2 virus and the COVID-19 disease.
32292848,We review the most current data with a focus on our basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics.
32292848,We discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multi-organ consequences, and outcomes.
32292848,With a focus on cardiovascular complications, we propose several mechanisms of injury.
32292848,The virology and potential mechanism of injury form the basis for a discussion of potential disease-modifying therapies.
32292911,We forecast 1,000,000 COVID-19 cases outside of China by March 30, 2020 based on a heuristic and WHO situation reports.
32292911,We do not model the COVID-19 pandemic; we model only the number of cases.
32292911,The proposed heuristic is based on a simple observation that the plot of the given data is well approximated by an exponential curve.
32292911,The exponential curve is used for forecasting the growth of new cases.
32292911,It has been tested for the last situation report of the last day.
32292911,Its accuracy has been 1.29% for the last day added and predicted by the 57 previous WHO situation reports (the date 18 March 2020).

32293582,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is a rapidly spreading global pandemic with over 1.9 million cases globally as of mid-April 2020.
32293582,Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak.
32293582,To conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32293582,Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019-January 30, 2020 on Weibo.
32293582,For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission and regression was used to fit a linear model to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported.
32293582,Qualitative content analysis used and inductive manual coding approach to identify parent classifications of news and user generated COVID-19 topics.
32293582,115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2,956 posts per day (min 0; max 13,587).
32293582,Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (p &lt; 0.001).
32293582,This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei provenance (where Wuhan is the capital city) and also held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei province.
32293582,Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21-days of the study period uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, and public reaction to outbreak control and response measures.
32293582,Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behavior.
32293582,Results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based upon quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the early epicenter in Wuhan city.
32293582,Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.
32294816,The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs.
32294816,One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV.
32294816,Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients.
32294816,The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
32294816,本文报道我院收治并行支气管肺泡灌洗诊断新型冠状病毒肺炎2例，1例有流行病学史、临床症状及影像学高度疑似，但反复咽拭子阴性患者；1例确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎患者，出院前临床症状消失，胸部CT显示影像学表现明显好转，咽拭子2次阴性，达到出院标准。
32294816,我们对2例患者的支气管肺泡灌洗液，分别进行新冠病毒ORF 1ab基因、N基因及新冠病毒核酸检测。
32294816,结果表明，支气管肺泡灌洗液新型冠状病毒核酸检测阳性率高，对疑诊或者确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎患者出院咽拭子核酸检测阴性但肺部仍残留病灶行支气管肺泡灌洗有助于尽早诊断及指导治疗、判断预后。.
32295188,At the end of 2019 a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome expanded globally from Wuhan, China.
32295188,In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARS-Cov-2 virus a global pandemic.
32295188,We performed a narrative review to describe existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective.
32295188,MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles.
32295188,Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current state of the art.
32295188,In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and preparedness.
32295322,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection in Nanyang City, so as to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. <b>Methods:</b> The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, atory and radiologic data of 150 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to the designated hospitals in Nanyang City from January 24,2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The 150 patients with 2019 nCov infection consisted of 67 men and 83 women, and the median age was 45±16 years; 69 of them were the first generation case,60 of them were the second generation case, 6 of them were the third generation case,the median incubation period of the first generation case was 5.4±2.2 days, and the second generation case was 6.7±3.1 days, and the first-generation cases are the majority in severe patients (69%) .
32295322,The most common basic disease was hypertension (13 cases, 9%), diabetes (9 cases, 6%), and the most common symptom is fever(142 cases, 95%, 63% showed moderate fever) , cough and sputum(108 cases,72%), fatigue(23 cases,15%), anorexia(20 cases, 13%), headache, diarrhea, muscle soreness, sore throat as the first symptoms.
32295322,The average time from onset of symptoms to consultation was 4.2±2.2 days for all patients.
32295322,The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and eosinophilia (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and AST.
32295322,High, very few patients have renal impairment.
32295322,Among the inflammation-related indicators, the main manifestations are increased CRP (66 cases, 43%) and ESR (86 cases, 57%), elevated D-Dimer in 29% of patients. 144 cases have different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT examination, with 30 cases (21%) on one side and 144 cases (79%) on both sides.
32295322,Morphologically, most of the lesions were patchy ground glass lesions, which could be accompanied by air bronchus signs and some consolidation and paving stone signs.
32295322,Of the cases showing &quot;white lung&quot;, 87% were sever ill or critically ill.
32295322,After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was 12±4 days. <b>Conclusion:</b> A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases.
32295322,The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease. <b>目的：</b> 分析河南省南阳市2019新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染患者的流行病学和临床特点，为临床诊治提供依据。
32295322,<b>方法：</b> 对2020年1月24日至2020年2月16日在南阳市各定点医院收治的150例2019-nCoV感染患者的流行病学、临床症状、实验室和影像学资料进行回顾性分析，其中男67例，女83例，年龄3~98岁，平均（45±16）岁。

32296837,Public health preparedness for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging in the absence of setting-specific epidemiological data.
32296837,Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, UK.
32296837,We analyzed routine diagnostic data for &gt;70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017.
32296837,Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63.
32296837,Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported.
32296837,With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs.
32296837,These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19.
32296837,Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.
32297723,With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic disease has come true.
32297723,Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019.
32297723,As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded.
32297723,Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
32297723,Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus.
32297723,Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%).
32297723,Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection.
32297723,At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32297723,Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
32297723,Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
32297723,Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
32297868,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed many areas of public health preparedness that are lacking, especially in lower- and middle-income countries.
32297868,Digital interventions provide many opportunities for strengthening health systems and could be vital resources in the current public health emergency.
32297868,We provide several use cases for infection control, home-based diagnosis and screening, empowerment through information, public health surveillance and epidemiology, and leveraging crowd-sourced data.
32297868,A thoughtful, concerted effort-leveraging existing experience and robust enterprise-grade technologies-can have a substantive impact on the immediate and distal consequences of COVID-19.
32298250,Community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in the United States in February 2020.
32298250,By mid-March, all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City (NYC), and four U.S. territories had reported cases of COVID-19.
32298250,This report describes the geographic distribution of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths reported by each U.S. state, each territory and freely associated state,* DC, and NYC during February 12-April 7, 2020, and estimates cumulative incidence for each jurisdiction.
32298250,In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7).
32298250,As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States.
32298250,Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC.
32298250,On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases.
32298250,Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC.
32298250,Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.
32298250,Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.
32298251,Since SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in December 2019 (1), approximately 1.3 million cases have been reported worldwide (2), including approximately 330,000 in the United States (3).
32298251,To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET).
32298251,This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance.
32298251,Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged ≥50 years, and 54.4% were male.
32298251,The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population.
32298251,Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged ≥65 years.
32298251,Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%).
32298251,These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions.
32298251,These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain)<sup>†</sup> to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public.
32298251,In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5).
32298251,Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.
32298803,The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals' lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide.
32298803,Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers.
32298803,However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown.
32298803,We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes.
32298803,Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients.
32298803,The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings.
32298803,Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.
32299206,It seems that coronaviruses take an important place in the 21th century history.
32299206,Five of seven human coronavirus was isolated in this century.
32299206,Unfortunately, last three of them entered our life with a fear of outbreak, pandemic or death.
32299206,Last human coronavirus which emerged world from Wuhan China, SARS CoV-2 and its clinical expression, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recently taken a significant place in our daily practice.
32299206,Initial reports showed that, its origin was bats.
32299206,It transmitted human to human by droplet and contact routes, but some doubt about airborne, fecal or intrauterine transmission also should be removed.
32299206,Its R0 value is 2.3 but it could be as high as 5.7.
32299206,Its case fatality rate was 6.3, but it was different in different ages and counties, and it could be over 15%.
32299206,According to early models total 10–12 weeks is required to control an outbreak in the community.
32299206,While different countries show different daily case numbers, total number of case, case mortality rates or R0, it seems they show a similar epidemic curve.
32299206,Every day we learn new data about the current outbreak.
32299206,Since the outbreak is not over yet, every detail should be evaluated carefully and the updates should be followed closely to monitor the epidemiological properties of COVID-19.
32299330,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 12 April 2020: notifications = 6,394; deaths = 46.
32299330,The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease.
32299330,Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
32299330,Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked.
32299330,The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
32299330,Internationally, cases continue to increase.
32299330,The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.
32299330,The epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.
32300673,A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with human to human transmission and extreme human sickness has been as of late announced from the city of Wuhan in China.
32300673,Our objectives were to mutation analysis between recently reported genomes at various times and locations and to characterize the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics programs.
32300673,Information on the variation of viruses is of considerable medical and biological impacts on the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of infectious diseases.
32300673,To understand the genomic structure and variations of the SARS-CoV-2.
32300673,The study analyzed 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available in GenBank, National MicrobiologyData Center (NMDC) and NGDC Genome Warehouse from December-2019 until 05 of April-2020.
32300673,The genomic signature analysis demonstrates that a strong association between the time of sample collection, location of sample and accumulation of genetic diversity.
32300673,We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C&gt;T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T&gt;C in ORF8 gene and 29095C&gt;T in the N gene.
32300673,The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
32300673,The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.
32301099,The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world.
32301099,We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment.
32301099,Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study.
32301099,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared.
32301099,Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters.
32301099,Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases.
32301099,Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03).
32301099,In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02).
32301099,There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults.
32301099,There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases.
32301099,The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03).
32301099,Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).
32301099,The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
32301600,The current outbreak of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started in China in December 2019 and has since spread to several other countries.
32301600,On March 25, 2020, a total of 375,498 cases had been confirmed globally with 2,201 cases in Brazil, showing the urgency of reacting to this international public health emergency.
32301600,While in most cases, mild symptoms are observed, in some cases the infection leads to serious pulmonary disease.
32301600,As a result, the possible consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for pregnant women and its potential effects on the management of assisted reproductive treatments, demand attention.
32301600,In this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women, and discuss the current evidence of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and its potential consequences for assisted reproductive treatments.
32301600,Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks.
32301600,However, considering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles.
32301600,New evidence must be considered carefully in order to adjust these recommendations accordingly at any time and to guide assisted reproductive treatments.
32302000,The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has drawn global intensive attention1-3.
32302000,Most of studies paid attention to epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of inpatients with COVID-191-3.
32302000,However, little studies have focused on clinical characteristics of discharged patients with severe COVID-19, especially the duration of viral shedding.
32302953,The outbreak of a new coronavirus, first reported in Wuhan, China, is spreading around the world.
32302953,Information on the characteristics of children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited.
32302953,In this retrospective study, we recruited 10 children infected with SARS-COV-2 from January 27 to March 10, 2020, in Changsha, China.
32302953,We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT findings for these children.
32302953,Qualitative descriptive analysis was used to describe the key results.
32302953,Ten children were included.
32302953,Three were male and seven were female.
32302953,Three were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, and seven were from Changsha.
32302953,All had a history of close contact with adults with COVID-19 before the onset of disease.
32302953,Clinical manifestations included fever in four cases, respiratory symptoms in three cases, febrile convulsions in one case, vomiting in one case, abdominal pain in one case, and asymptomatic infection in two cases.
32302953,All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission.
32302953,Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever.
32302953,In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated.
32302953,In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal.
32302953,All were treated with symptomatic support without complications.
32302953,Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children.
32302953,The results of stool swab tests should be considered for discharge and release from isolation.
32302954,In December 2019, Wuhan, China, experienced an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).
32302954,The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited.
32302954,This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19.
32302954,Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment.
32302954,This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020.
32302954,The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020.
32302954,We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data.
32302954,We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients.
32302954,Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease.
32302954,Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]).
32302954,We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients.
32302954,We expressed the measurement data as mean ± standard deviation.
32302954,We collected data for age (49.39 ± 18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32 ± 6.70 days), and laboratory indicators.
32302954,We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were p &lt; 0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were p &lt; 0.05.
32302954,We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients.
32302954,Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease.
32302954,Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.
32303592,Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [lsqb]HLA[rsqb] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32303592,We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides.
32303592,We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses.
32303592,The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles.
32303592,However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (Lin M, Tseng H-K, Trejaut JA, Lee H-L, Loo J-H, Chu C-C, Chen P-J, Su Y-W, Lim KH, Tsai Z-U, Lin R-Y, Lin R-S, Huang C-H.
32303592,BMC Med Genet 4:9.
32303592,2003.).
32303592,Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity.
32303592,Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population.
32303592,In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease.
32303592,HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive.
32303592,Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of viral severity in the population.
32303592,Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.
32304191,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019.
32304191,The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020.
32304191,By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate.
32304191,This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia.
32304191,In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death.
32304191,According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
32304191,Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults.
32304191,Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease.
32304191,However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe.
32304191,Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases.
32304191,The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published.
32304191,This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.
32304371,Health literacy is the process of obtaining knowledge, motivation and individual competencies to understand and access information, express opinions and make decisions with respect to health promotion and maintenance.
32304371,This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life.
32304371,This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency.
32304371,This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view.
32304371,This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control.
32304371,Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence.
32304371,This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents.
32304371,All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.
32304371,Therefore, public health literacy is needed.
32304371,La alfabetización en salud es el proceso centrado en la obtención del conocimiento, la motivación y las competencias individuales para entender y acceder a información, expresar opiniones y tomar decisiones relacionadas con la promoción y el mantenimiento de la salud, lo que es aplicable en diferentes contextos, entornos y a lo largo de toda la vida.
32304371,Esta perspectiva conceptual es muy necesaria ante la emergencia del virus SARS-CoV-2 que produce la enfermedad Covid-19, la cual ha producido una pandemia con efectos devastadores, no sólo desde el punto de vista de la salud, sino también, de manera muy importante, desde el económico, político y social.
32304371,En este ensayo se tratan de establecer los elementos basados en la evidencia científica que orientan las políticas públicas de prevención y control, entre los que destacan: a) la inteligencia epidemiológica, la cual incluye no sólo la estrategia de vigilancia poblacional sino, ante la imposibilidad real de identificación de todos los casos positivos, la puesta en práctica de estrategias de vigilancia centinela y la vigilancia basada en eventos; b) las medidas de mitigación de la propagación de la epidemia, tales como distanciamiento social e higiene, lavado de manos, cuarentena, restricción de movimiento y utilización de cubrebocas, entre otras; c) medidas de supresión de la transmisión cuando el número de casos es muy elevado, como el endurecimiento de medidas drásticas de encierro en casa; d) fortalecimiento de la capacidad de atención médica en los sistemas de salud e incremento de la capacidad de prevención de la transmisión en los servicios de salud, incluyendo la utilidad de las pruebas diagnósticas; y e) el desarrollo de vacunas profilácticas contra Covid-19, así como la generación de agentes terapéuticos.
32304371,Todas estas acciones no sólo deben implementarse rápidamente desde la perspectiva multidisciplinaria y multisectorial de la salud pública para contener, prevenir y controlar la epidemia, sino que necesitan obligatoriamente del concurso de la comunidad como responsabilidad compartida.
32304371,Debido a todo esto, es necesaria la alfabetización en salud pública.
32305025,Since December 2019, a new outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and rapidly spread throughout China, however, confirmed cases are still increasing worldwide.
32305025,To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China.
32305025,Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing.
32305025,Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China).
32305025,Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles.
32305025,The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2-14 days.
32305025,Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue.
32305025,Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type.
32305025,Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images.
32305025,Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases.
32305025,CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively.
32305025,Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load.
32305025,Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.
32305506,Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure.
32305506,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.
32305506,We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection.
32305506,In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated.
32305506,We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak.
32305506,We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.
32305506,This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.
32305884,Coronavirus disease 2019 is a pandemic influencing the first half of the year 2020.
32305884,The virus has rapidly spread to many countries.
32305884,Studies are rapidly published to share information regarding epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic patterns, and prognosis.
32305884,The following review condenses the surge of information into an organized format.
32306500,Pre-clinical responses to fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks heavily depend on choosing the best isolates for animal models that inform diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.
32306500,Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters.
32306500,Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation.
32306500,We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatic approach.
32306500,Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate.
32306500,This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models.
32306500,Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.
32307115,The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32307115,The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority.
32307115,Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used.
32307115,The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control.
32307115,This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2.
32307115,We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.
32307322,Current studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare.
32307322,The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown.
32307322,Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children.
32307322,We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series.
32307322,Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed.
32307322,A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis.
32307322,Nine case series were included.
32307322,In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history.
32307322,The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%).
32307322,Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care.
32307322,Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%.
32307322,Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon.
32307322,There are 26% children are asymptomatic.
32307322,The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%).
32307322,Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19.
32307322,Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease.
32307322,COVID-19 has distinct features in children.
32307322,The disease severity is mild.
32307322,Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing.
32308494,Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China.
32308494,The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide.
32308494,Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan.
32308494,Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients.
32308494,We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province.
32308494,The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years.
32308494,The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket.
32308494,Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission.
32308494,Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom.
32308494,The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days.
32308494,CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively.
32308494,The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%).
32308494,Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment.
32308494,In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan.
32308494,Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people.
32308494,Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.
32308532,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for more fatalities than the SARS coronavirus, despite being in the initial stage of a global pandemic.
32308532,The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1.
32308532,We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila.
32308532,Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020.
32308532,Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25.
32308532,Physical examination was unremarkable. <i>Influenza B</i>, human coronavirus 229E, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs.
32308532,On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines.
32308532,Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged.
32308532,Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. <i>Influenza B</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs.
32308532,He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation.
32308532,On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines.
32308532,On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him.
32308532,He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China.
32308532,This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues.
32308532,Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease.
32308532,As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines.
32308532,Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.
32309108,In this paper are presented mathematical predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the COVID-19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss error function, with four parameters, as a cumulative distribution function.
32309108,We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy.
32309108,The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution.
32309108,We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available.
32309108,We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached.
32309108,We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results.
32309108,We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities.
32309108,Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.
32309267,We describe two elderly patients evaluated at emergency departments for anosmia/dysgeusia in the absence of any other respiratory symptoms prior to or upon admission.
32309267,In the current epidemiological context, clinical and biological work-up led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
32309267,Unfortunately, one of the patients died during hospitalization, but the other recovered and was discharged.
32309267,In the current epidemiological situation, anosmia and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory conditions should be carefully evaluated.Special attention should be given to patients with non-classic COVID-19 symptoms in order to reduce transmission and protect health providers.
32309679,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32309679,The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32309679,Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32309679,Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32309796,As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies.
32309796,Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.
32309796,In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies.
32309796,We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China.
32309796,We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities.
32309796,We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased.
32309796,All data were made publicly available in real time.
32309796,We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60).
32309796,Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children.
32309796,Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally.
32309796,In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009).
32309796,Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
32309796,News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency.
32309796,The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China.
32309796,As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems.
32309796,In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

32310621,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses.
32310621,Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43.
32310621,However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans.
32310621,The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.
32310621,The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic.
32310621,In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
32310621,Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death.
32310621,SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates.
32310621,Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.
32310621,However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain.
32310621,Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults.
32310621,Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs.
32310621,Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.
32310621,The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
32310621,In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.
32310621,In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
32310924,The COVID-19 epidemic is one of the most demanding challenges for the public health organizations.
32310924,The Lombardy region faced firstly this outbreak in Italy and recorded rapidly a saturation of intensive care and internal medicine beds.
32310924,Consequently, this lack of technical and human resources, together with people mobility restriction to contain virus spreading, determined the interruption of elective surgical and interventional cardiovascular procedures.
32310924,In addition, the emergency track of acute patients has been rewritten due to limited resources and viral co-infection (pre- or in-hospital).
32310924,Herein, we describe two cases of acute coronary syndrome with severe coronary artery disease and an indication for coronary artery bypass grafting.
32310924,The first patient, COVID-19 positive, was treated with transcatheter technique due to symptom instability and underwent temporary circulatory support without intubation.
32310924,The second patient received an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then transferred, in accordance with government emergency provisions, to a hub hospital to undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and short intensive care unit stay.
32310924,These two apparently similar cases were treated differently according to the moving epidemiological and organizational conditions.
32311151,Under the outbreak of COVID-19, it was urgent to analyze the cases from clinical features and epidemiological factors, as well as understand the effectiveness of measures taken on disease prevent and control.
32311151,A retrospective study was applied for descriptive analysis of clinical features and epidemiological factors of confirmed cases in four cities of Zhejiang.
32311151,The Onset-admission interval was calculated and plotted as well.
32311151,The provincial measures regarding the response of COVID-19 were summed up and sorted out.
32311151,The distribution and sex and age were under normality distribution, and the age of 20 to 80 were all in risk of developing the disease.
32311151,Clinical features of fever and cough were found mostly happen on patients.
32311151,More than half of the patients had image changed on chest from reported data.
32311151,The factor of closely contacted with confirmed cases was the most cause to the disease.
32311151,The median onset-admission interval was 6 days in Zhejiang province.
32311151,As of the efficient health system, COVID-19 had been successfully prevented and controlled in Zhejiang.
32311151,Males and females were all vulnerable to COVID-19.
32311151,Preventing contact with confirmed cases could largely avoid the disease to happen.
32311151,The government should take emergent and effective measures to prevent and treatment of the pandemic disease.
32311437,COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection.
32311437,Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country.
32311437,Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1-3].
32311437,Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32311437,At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low.
32311437,However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples.
32311437,METHODS: | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32311437,This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29.
32311437,COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's ⟪pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) ⟫, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1].
32311437,The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type.
32311437,During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection.
32311437,All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process.
32311437,The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
32311437,The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests.
32311437,RESULTS: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times).
32311437,The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times).
32311437,DISCUSSION|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs).
32311437,Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.
32311448,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may predispose patients to thrombotic disease, both in the venous and arterial circulations, due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis.
32311448,In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy.
32311448,Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease.
32311448,Herein, we review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, and of those with preexisting thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32311646,The world is in the grip of pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).
32311646,Children appear to be only mildly affected but for those countries that are still preparing for their first wave of infections, it is salutary to have some estimates with which to plan for eventual contingencies.
32311646,These assessments would include acute hospital admission requirements, intensive care admissions and deaths per given population.
32311646,It is also useful to have an estimate of how many paediatric admissions to expect per given population.
32311646,However it is only very recently that paediatric epidemiological data has become available.
32311646,This paper will create an interactive spreadsheet model to estimate population and paediatric admissions for a given population, with the author's country, Malta, as a worked example for both.
32311650,In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China.
32311650,We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
32311650,We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020.
32311650,Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market.
32311650,Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities.
32311650,Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea.
32311650,On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia.
32311650,In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications.
32311650,As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.
32311650,Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.
32313804,In this review, we discuss the current implications of the changing genomic epidemiology of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its potential relationship with the change of clinical manifestations in patients with confirmed infection.
32313804,Over the course of the current pandemic, the virus has been found more diverse in new countries.
32313804,Simultaneously, also new clinical manifestations are observed, particularly more prominent gastrointestinal and neurological findings.
32313804,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is changing not only its epidemiology, but also its genomic diversity and clinical manifestations, both aspects coupled, needs to be considered in the study of this ongoing pandemic.
32313824,The present outbreak associated with corona virus [CoVs] in China which is believed to be one of the massive eruptions towards mankind in 2019-2020.
32313824,In the present scenario CoVs has been transmitted to the European and American regions through the travellers from wide spread countries like China and Japan.
32313824,The viral disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or patients and creating huge risk of mortality.
32313824,CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism.
32313824,Human CoVs can cause common cold and influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as pneumonia.
32313824,Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
32313824,It mainly produces the melanoma differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and endosomal toll-like receptor 3.
32313824,How CoVs affects the function of the immune system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge.
32313824,No Food and Drug Administration approved treatment is available till date.
32313824,In this review, we are tried to explore the epidemiology, pathogenesis and current treatment of CoVs infection.
32313824,The promising therapeutics molecules against CoVs and future prospective have been also discussed which will be helpful for researchers to find out the new molecules for the treatment of CoVs disease.
32313885,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32313885,The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32313885,Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32313885,Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32314081,The COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on issues of epidemiology, public health, and vaccine design.
32314081,I submit that attention to COVID-19 pharmacologic therapy needs similar emphasis, including identifying any existing medications that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients.
32314790,Coronaviruses contribute to the burden of respiratory diseases in children, frequently manifesting in upper respiratory symptoms considered to be part of the &quot;common cold.&quot; Recent epidemics of novel coronaviruses recognized in the 21st century have highlighted issues of zoonotic origins of transmissible respiratory viruses and potential transmission, disease, and mortality related to these viruses.
32314790,In this review, we discuss what is known about the virology, epidemiology, and disease associated with pediatric infection with the common community-acquired human coronaviruses, including species 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, and the coronaviruses responsible for past world-wide epidemics due to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32315723,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents a potentially fatal disease of great global public health importance.
32315723,As of March 26, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 462,801 confirmed cases and 20,839 deaths globally, which is more than those caused by SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2003 and 2013, respectively.
32315723,The epidemic has posed considerable challenges worldwide.
32315723,Under a strict mechanism of massive prevention and control, China has seen a rapid decrease in new cases of coronavirus; however, the global situation remains serious.
32315723,Additionally, the origin of COVID-19 has not been determined and no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is currently available.
32315723,Based on the published data, this review systematically discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and current intervention measures related to COVID-19 in the hope that it may provide a reference for future studies and aid in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.
32315817,Since being first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 8, 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, has spread globally.
32315817,Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently.
32315817,We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19.
32315817,Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32315817,The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3-27.5 %).
32315817,The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1-9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6-18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1-6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5-1.8 %).
32315817,The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6-13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7-10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6-3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9-8.6 %).
32315817,The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively.
32315817,The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0-61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4-56.9 %), respectively.
32315817,Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19.
32315817,The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19.
32315817,ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery.
32315817,The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS and MERS.
32315963,The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China.
32315963,Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus.
32315963,Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available.
32315963,To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people.
32315963,An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province.
32315963,Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures.
32315963,Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio.
32315963,Results also revealed that young people aged 21-40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use.
32315963,To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).
32316118,In the current work, we discovered and analyzed the epidemiological paradox between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and malaria in the initial phase of the ongoing pandemic.
32316118,From the analysis of distribution data, the endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries.
32316118,In this sense, molecular and genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., in ACE2) might play a protective role against coronavirus infection.
32316118,Moreover, the mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects (e.g., retinal toxicity).
32316118,All these data provide important insights to understand the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of some currently available medications.
32316751,There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades.
32316751,The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, is the most dangerous, which spread to 163 countries and 6 continents and caused a major public health emergency worldwide.
32316751,The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human.
32316751,As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%.
32316751,There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important.
32316751,In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures.
32316751,We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.
32317044,The objective of this paper is to prepare the government and citizens of India to take or implement the control measures proactively to reduce the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32317044,In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach.
32317044,The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020.
32317044,The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models.
32317044,The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India.
32317044,This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020.
32317044,The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India.
32317044,If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse.
32317044,The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further.
32317044,This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.
32317050,BackgroundIn December 2019, a pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has rapidly spread around the world since then.AimThis study aims to understand the research gaps related to COVID-19 and propose recommendations for future research.MethodsWe undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020.
32317050,We analysed the sources, publication date, type and topic of the retrieved articles/studies.ResultsWe included 249 articles in this scoping review.
32317050,More than half (59.0%) were conducted in China.
32317050,Guidance/guidelines and consensuses statements (n = 56; 22.5%) were the most common.
32317050,Most (n = 192; 77.1%) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, 35 (14.1%) on preprint servers and 22 (8.8%) posted online.
32317050,Ten genetic studies (4.0%) focused on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 while the topics of molecular studies varied.
32317050,Nine of 22 epidemiological studies focused on estimating the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection (R<sub>0</sub>).
32317050,Of all identified guidance/guidelines (n = 35), only ten fulfilled the strict principles of evidence-based practice.
32317050,The number of articles published per day increased rapidly until the end of January.ConclusionThe number of articles on COVID-19 steadily increased before 6 February 2020.
32317050,However, they lack diversity and are almost non-existent in some study fields, such as clinical research.
32317050,The findings suggest that evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies will be improved when more results from clinical research becomes available.
32317267,To evaluate viral loads at different stages of disease progression in patients infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first four months of the epidemic in Zhejiang province, China.
32317267,Retrospective cohort study.
32317267,A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease.
32317267,Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020.
32317267,Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples.
32317267,Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product.
32317267,Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load.
32317267,Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples.
32317267,RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients.
32317267,The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32317267,The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P&lt;0.001).
32317267,The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04).
32317267,In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group.
32317267,Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients.
32317267,The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.
32317810,As the SARS-CoV-2 virus race around the world across the different population, there needs to be a consolidated effort to understand the divergence of demographically distributed strains.
32317810,The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields.
32317810,Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission.
32317810,Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions.
32317810,It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
32317810,The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region.
32317810,Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.
32317810,Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.
32318703,We retrospectively analysed 26 persistently asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) carriers.
32318703,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing were obtained.
32318703,Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence.
32318703,The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8-24 days) and 21.5 days (10-36 days), respectively.
32318703,The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (n=16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2-20 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT(n=10, 38.5%; 12.5 days[8-22 days]; P&lt;0.01).
32318703,Seven patients (70.0%) with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved CT findings.
32318703,Obvious improvement in CT findings was observed in three patients (30.0%) despite positive nucleic acid test results.
32318703,In asymptomatic patients, changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest CT can occur.
32318703,It is worth noting the long existence of SARS-CoV-2 in some asymptomatic patients and false-negative results need to be considered in SARS-CoV-2nucleic acid test.
32318865,Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
32318865,While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear.
32318865,Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses.
32318865,A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection.
32318865,Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality.
32318865,While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome.
32318865,Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed.
32318865,COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality.
32318865,More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.
32318915,In the early months of the COVID-19 epidemic, some have wondered if the force of this global experience will solve the problem of vaccine refusal that has vexed and preoccupied the global public health community for the last several decades.
32318915,Drawing on historical and epidemiological analyses, we critique contemporary approaches to reducing vaccine hesitancy and articulate our notion of vaccine confidence as an expanded way of conceptualizing the problem and how to respond to it.
32318915,Intervening on the rush of vaccine optimism we see pervading present discourse around the COVID-19 epidemic, we call for a re-imagination of the culture of public health and the meaning of vaccine safety regulations.
32318915,Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the community-social, political, and moral as well as biological.
32318915,The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself.
32318915,The narrative work and policy actions entailed in actualizing such changes will, we expect, be essential in achieving a true vaccine confidence, however the public reacts to the specific vaccine that may be developed for COVID-19.
32319439,Chronicity and comorbidity influence the risk of CoViD-19 infection and the course of the disease.
32319439,Epidemiological data and studies performed show different rates of chronic diseases and multimorbidity among patients affected by CoViD-19 in the various countries and areas, but they consistently stress their impact on CoViD-19 infection.
32319439,In order to protect chronic and frail patients, the Italian Medicines Agency has taken measures to extend the therapeutic plans and monitoring registers; hopefully, therapeutic plans for antidiabetics, drugs for respiratory diseases and oral anticoagulant drugs will be abolished since they do not offer any additional advantage in terms of appropriateness and traceability of outcomes.
32319439,The MaCroScopio project (Observatory on Chronic Diseases), regarding the CoViD-19 emergency, has started a new research path to foster the integration of the administrative data flows with the CoViD-19 Registers for planning and research purposes in the context of chronicity, as well as to evaluate the economic and organizational impact of the pandemic.
32320004,The current rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection justifies the global effort to identify effective preventive strategies and optimal medical management.
32320004,While data are available for adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), limited reports have analyzed pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32320004,To evaluate currently reported pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32320004,An extensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from December 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020, by combining the terms coronavirus and coronavirus infection in several electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL), and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.
32320004,Retrospective cross-sectional and case-control studies, case series and case reports, bulletins, and national reports about the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection were included.
32320004,The risk of bias for eligible observational studies was assessed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.
32320004,A total of 815 articles were identified.
32320004,Eighteen studies with 1065 participants (444 patients were younger than 10 years, and 553 were aged 10 to 19 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis.
32320004,All articles reflected research performed in China, except for 1 clinical case in Singapore.
32320004,Children at any age were mostly reported to have mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough, and fatigue, or were asymptomatic.
32320004,Bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities were the main radiologic features, and these findings were also reported in asymptomatic patients.
32320004,Among the included articles, there was only 1 case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant.
32320004,No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years.
32320004,Available data about therapies were limited.
32320004,To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32320004,The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.
32320091,Since the first case of &quot;pneumonia of unknown aetiology&quot; was diagnosed at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China on 30 December 2019, what was recognised thereafter as &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot; (SARS-CoV-2) has spread over the four continents, causing the respiratory manifestations of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID- 19) and satisfying the epidemiological criteria for a label of &quot;pandemic.&quot; The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a huge impact on dermatological practice including the marked reduction of face-to-face consultations in favour of teledermatology, the uncertainties concerning the outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with common inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis receiving immunosuppressive/immunomodulating systemic therapies; the direct involvement of dermatologists in COVID-19 care for patients assistance and new research needs to be addressed.
32320091,It is not known yet, if skin lesions and derangement of the skin barrier could make it easier for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit via indirect contact; it remains to be defined if specific mucosal or skin lesions are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although some unpublished observations indicate the occurrence of a transient varicelliform exanthema during the early phase of the infection.
32320091,SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humans that is highly contagious, can spread quickly, and is capable of causing enormous health, economic and societal impacts in any setting.
32320091,The consequences may continue long after the pandemic resolves, and new management modalities for dermatology may originate from the COVID-19 disaster.
32320091,Learning from experience may help to cope with future major societal changes.
32320516,A cluster of pneumonia (COVID-19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
32320516,SARS-CoV-2 transmits mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic diseases are high-risk population.
32320516,People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission.
32320516,COVID-19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to COVID-19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int).
32320516,Here, we summarized the current known knowledge regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the prevention and control COVID-19.
32321075,Surveillance of the severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Brazil aims to characterize the circulation of the Influenza A and B viruses in hospitalized cases and deaths, having been expanded in 2012 to include other respiratory viruses.
32321075,COVID-19 was detected in Brazil for the time in the 9th epidemiological week of 2020, and the test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus was included in the surveillance protocol starting in the 12th epidemiological week.
32321075,This study's objective was to investigate the pattern of hospitalizations for SARI in Brazil since the entry of SARS-CoV-2, comparing the temporal and age profiles and laboratory results to the years 2010 through 2019.
32321075,In 2020, hospitalizations for SARI, compiled from the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 up to the 12th week, exceeded the numbers observed during the same period in each of the previous 10 years.
32321075,The age bracket over 60 years was the most heavily affected, at higher than historical levels.
32321075,There was a considerable increase in negative laboratory tests, suggesting circulation of a different virus from those already present in the panel.
32321075,We concluded that the increase in hospitalizations for SARI, the lack of specific information on the etiological agent, and the predominance of cases among the elderly during the same period in which there was an increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 are all consistent with the hypothesis that severe cases of COVID-19 are already being detected by SARI surveillance, placing an overload on the health system.
32321075,The inclusion of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the SARI surveillance protocol and the test's effective nationwide deployment are extremely important for monitoring the evolution of severe COVID-19 cases in Brazil.
32321075,A vigilância de síndrome respiratória aguda grave (SRAG) no Brasil visa a caracterizar a circulação dos vírus Influenza A e B em casos hospitalizados e óbitos, tendo sido ampliada em 2012 para incluir outros vírus respiratórios.
32321075,A COVID-19 foi detectada no Brasil pela primeira vez na 9ª semana epidemiológica de 2020 e o teste para o vírus SARS-CoV-2 foi incluído no protocolo de vigilância a partir da 12ª semana epidemiológica.
32321075,O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar o padrão de hospitalizações por SRAG no país após a entrada do SARS-CoV-2, comparando o perfil temporal, etário e de resultados laboratoriais com os anos de 2010 a 2019.
32321075,Em 2020, a hospitalização por SRAG, contabilizada desde a data do primeiro caso de COVID-19 confirmado até a 12ª semana, superou o observado, no mesmo período, em cada um dos 10 anos anteriores.
32321075,A faixa etária acima de 60 anos foi a mais acometida, em nível acima do histórico.
32321075,Houve um aumento considerável de testes laboratoriais negativos, sugerindo a circulação de um vírus diferente dos presentes no painel.
32321075,Concluímos que o aumento das hospitalizações por SRAG, a falta de informação específica sobre o agente etiológico e a predominância de casos entre idosos, no mesmo período de tempo em que cresce o número de casos novos de COVID-19, é coerente com a hipótese de que os casos graves da doença já estejam sendo detectados pela vigilância de SRAG com sobrecarga para o sistema de saúde.
32321075,A inclusão da testagem para SARS-CoV-2 no protocolo de vigilância de SRAG e sua efetiva implementação são de grande importância para acompanhar a evolução dos casos graves da doença no país.
32321075,La vigilancia del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SRAG) en Brasil tiene como objetivo caracterizar la circulación de los virus de la Influenza A y B en casos y muertes hospitalizadas, y se expandió en 2012 para incluir otros virus respiratorios.
32321075,La COVID-19 se detectó en Brasil por la primera vez en la 9ª semana epidemiológica de 2020, y el examen test para el virus SARS-CoV-2 se incluyó en el protocolo de vigilancia a partir de la 12ª semana epidemiológica.
32321075,El objetivo de este estudio fue investigar el patrón de hospitalizaciones por SRAG en Brasil desde la entrada de SARS-CoV-2, comparando el perfil temporal y de edad y los resultados de laboratorio entre los años 2010 a 2019.
32321075,En 2020, las hospitalizaciones por SRAG, compiladas a partir de la fecha del primer caso confirmado de COVID-19 hasta la 12ª semana, excedió los números observados durante el mismo período en cada uno de los 10 años anteriores.
32321075,El grupo de edad mayor de 60 años fue el más afectado, a niveles superiores a los históricos.
32321075,Hubo un aumento considerable en las pruebas de laboratorio negativas, lo que sugiere la circulación de un virus diferente de los que ya están presentes en el panel.
32321075,Se concluye que el aumento de las hospitalizaciones por SRAG, la falta de información específica sobre el agente etiológico y el predominio de casos entre los ancianos en el mismo período en que hubo un aumento de casos nuevos de COVID-19 se entiende que con esta hipótesis de que los casos graves de COVID-19 ya estén siendo monitorados por la vigilancia de SRAG, lo que genera una sobrecarga en el sistema de salud.
32321075,La inclusión de los exámenes para SARS-CoV-2 en el protocolo de vigilancia de SRAG y la eficacia de implementación son de grande importancia para monitorear la evolución de los casos graves de COVID-19 en Brasil.
32321116,This review aims to verify the main epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory-related, and therapeutic aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critically ill pediatric patients.
32321116,An extensive review of the medical literature on COVID-19 was performed, mainly focusing on the critical care of pediatric patients, considering expert opinions and recent reports related to this new disease.
32321116,Experts from a large Brazilian public university analyzed all recently published material to produce a report aiming to standardize the care of critically ill children and adolescents.
32321116,The report emphasizes on the clinical presentations of the disease and ventilatory support in pediatric patients with COVID-19.
32321116,It establishes a flowchart to guide health practitioners on triaging critical cases.
32321116,COVID-19 is essentially an unknown clinical condition for the majority of pediatric intensive care professionals.
32321116,Guidelines developed by experts can help all practitioners standardize their attitudes and improve the treatment of COVID-19.
32322400,Since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, the number of globally confirmed cases according to World Health Organization statistics reached 292 124 in 189 countries by 22 March 2020.
32322400,The number of deaths reached 12 784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%.
32322400,Children population seems to be the least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities.
32322400,Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms.
32322400,After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue.
32322400,Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings.
32322400,Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32322400,Various reports have suggested an <i>in vivo</i> evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.
32322400,Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32322475,•IoT within infectious disease epidemiology is an emerging field of research, however the ubiquitous availability of smart technologies, as well as increased risks of infectious disease spread through the globalization and interconnectedness of the world necessitates its use for predicting, preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases•Considering the present situation in China, IoT based smart disease surveillance systems have the potential to be a major breakthrough in efforts to control the current pandemic.
32322475,With much of the infrastructure itself in place already (i.e. smartphones, wearable technologies, internet access) the role this technology can have in limiting the spread of the pandemic involves only the collection and analysis of data already gathered.
32322475,•More research must be carried out for the development of automated and effective alert systems to provide early and timely detection of outbreaks of such diseases in order to reduce morbidity mortality and prevent global spread.
32322993,At the beginning of the 21st century, a new deadly infectious disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recognized as a global public health threat.
32322993,Subsequently, ten years after the initial SARS cases occurred in 2002, new cases of another atypical respiratory disease caused worldwide concern.
32322993,This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS.
32322993,Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019.
32322993,For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent.
32322993,In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe.
32322993,As a result of the current importance of coronaviruses in global public health, we conducted a review to summarize and update, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of the three major diseases in humans caused by coronaviral infection.
32324209,Data are lacking whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32324209,To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.
32324209,Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020.
32324209,COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients.
32324209,The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors.
32324209,Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men.
32324209,The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%.
32324209,There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs.
32324209,The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%.
32324209,The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34).
32324209,Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs.
32324209,This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients.
32324209,These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32324359,In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin occured in Wuhan, China.
32324359,The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) and the respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19).
32324359,In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
32324359,We reviewed the international literature regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak.
32324359,Here below, we focus mainly on the diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis.
32324359,We detail the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19.
32324359,We also focus on the proper method of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.
32324359,We also cite the current national epidemiologic regulations of testing for novel coronavirus.
32324359,In the last section, we emphasize the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk patients.
32324359,The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and healthcare burden even in Hungary.
32324359,In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality.
32324359,The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care.
32324359,It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries.

32324359,2020; 161(17): 667–671. 2019 decemberében új koronavírus okozta járvány ütötte fel a fejét a kínai Wuhanban.
32324359,Az azonosított kórokozó egy új koronavírus, melyet „severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”-nek, azaz SARS-CoV-2-nek neveztek el, az általa kiváltott légzési tünetegyüttes pedig a „coronavirus disease 2019”, azaz COVID–19 nevet kapta.
32324359,Az Egészségügyi Világszervezet (WHO) a járványt 2020 márciusában pandémiává minősítette.
32324359,Áttekintettük a jelenleg elérhető nemzetközi irodalmat a COVID–19-járvány vonatkozásában.
32324359,Írásunkban az új koronavírus diagnosztikájára és prognosztikájára vonatkozó releváns információkat összegezzük.
32324359,Részletezzük a klinikai gyanú felvetéséhez szükséges anamnesztikus tényezőket és kezdeti vizsgálati eredményeket, a mikrobiológiai mintavétel módját, a molekuláris diagnosztikai tesztre – az arany standardnak minősülő ’real-time’ reverztranszkriptáz polimeráz-láncreakcióra (RT-PCR) – vonatkozó alapvető információkat, különös tekintettel a diagnosztikus tesztelést érintő, jelenleg érvényben lévő népegészségügyi szabályozásra.
32324359,Hangsúlyt fektetünk továbbá a nagy rizikójú betegek paramétereire és felismerésük módjára.
32324359,A COVID–19-pandémia Magyarországon is jelentős járványügyi és egészségügyi következményekkel járhat.
32324359,A járvány lassítására irányuló epidemiológiai intézkedéseken túl a már fertőzött személyek időbeli felismerése és megfelelő kórházi ellátása mortalitási szempontból is kulcskérdés.
32324359,A kritikus állapotú betegek esélyeit csak magas minőségű, körültekintő intenzív terápiás ellátással lehet javítani, s hogy a legjobbat tudjuk nyújtani, hasznos, ha felhasználjuk a már endémiás országokban dolgozó orvoskollégák tapasztalatait.
32324359,Orv Hetil.
32324359,2020; 160(17): 667–671.
32324422,Disease surveillance forms the basis for response to epidemics.
32324422,COVID-19 provides a modern example of why the classic mantra of &quot;person, place, and time&quot; remains crucial: epidemic control requires knowing trends in disease frequency in different subgroups and locations.
32324422,We review key epidemiological concepts and discuss some of the preventable methodologic errors that have arisen in reporting on the COVID-19 crisis. (<i>Am J Public Health</i>.
32324422,Published online ahead of print April 23, 2020: e1-e3. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2020.305708).
32324530,We describe the epidemiology of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in a call center in South Korea.
32324530,We obtained information on demographic characteristics by using standardized epidemiologic investigation forms.
32324530,We performed descriptive analyses and reported the results as frequencies and proportions for categoric variables.
32324530,Of 1,143 persons who were tested for COVID-19, a total of 97 (8.5%, 95% CI 7.0%-10.3%) had confirmed cases.
32324530,Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5% (95% CI 36.9%-50.4%).
32324530,The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2% (95% CI 11.6%- 22.0%).
32324530,Of the 97 persons with confirmed COVID-19, only 4 (1.9%) remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine, and none of their household contacts acquired secondary infections.
32324530,Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings.
32325252,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, now named as SARS-CoV-2, caused a series of acute atypical respiratory diseases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32325252,The disease caused by this virus was termed COVID-19.
32325252,The virus is transmittable between humans and has caused pandemic worldwide.
32325252,The number of death tolls continues to rise and a large number of countries have been forced to do social distancing and lockdown.
32325252,Lack of targeted therapy continues to be a problem.
32325252,Epidemiological studies showed that elder patients were more susceptible to severe diseases, while children tend to have milder symptoms.
32325252,Here we reviewed the current knowledge about this disease and considered the potential explanation of the different symptomatology between children and adults.
32326943,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was first declared in China in December 2019, and WHO declared the pandemic on 11 March 2020.
32326943,A fast-rising number of confirmed cases has been observed in all continents, with Europe at the epicentre of the outbreak at this moment.Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights is a significant public health issue during the epidemics.
32326943,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is new to humans, and only limited scientific evidence is available to identify the impact of the disease COVID-19 on SRH, including clinical presentation and outcomes of the infection during pregnancy, or for persons with STI/HIV-related immunosuppression.
32326943,Beyond the clinical scope of SRH, we should not neglect the impacts at the health system level and disruptions or interruptions in regular provision of SRH services, such as pre- and postnatal checks, safe abortion, contraception, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections.
32326943,Furthermore, other aspects merit attention such as the potential increase of gender-based violence and domestic abuse, and effects of stigma and discrimination associated with COVID-19 and their effects on SRH clients and health care providers.
32326943,Therefore, there is an urgent need for the scientific community to generate sound clinical, epidemiological, and psycho-social behavioral links between COVID-19 and SRH and rights outcomes.
32327608,The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment.
32327608,We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic.
32327608,We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy.
32327608,We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.
32327608,We estimate a generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions.
32327608,The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020.
32327608,We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities.
32327608,We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact.
32327608,Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%).
32327608,Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020).
32327608,Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.
32327757,Data on the detailed clinical progression of COVID-19 in conjunction with epidemiological and virological characteristics are limited.
32327757,In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously<sup>1-3</sup>.
32327757,Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing.
32327757,Median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 patients were male.
32327757,Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7).
32327757,Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness.
32327757,No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered.
32327757,All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset.
32327757,Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens.
32327757,These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2.
32327757,Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness.
32327757,Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.
32327901,A worldwide multi-scale interplay among a plethora of factors, ranging from micro-pathogens and individual or population interactions to macro-scale environmental, socio-economic and demographic conditions, entails the development of highly sophisticated mathematical models for robust representation of the contagious disease dynamics that would lead to the improvement of current outbreak control strategies and vaccination and prevention policies.
32327901,Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network.
32327901,Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks.
32327901,We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent efforts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of artificial intelligence.
32327901,This model can be adjusted to describe past outbreaks as well as COVID-19.
32327901,Our novel methodology may have important implications for national health systems, international stakeholders and policy makers.
32327922,Nicotinamide homeostasis is a candidate common denominator to explain smooth transitions, whether demographic, epidemiological or economic.
32327922,This 'NAD world', dependent on hydrogen-based energy, is not widely recognised as it is neither measured nor viewed from a sufficiently multi-genomic or historical perspective.
32327922,Reviewing the importance of meat and nicotinamide balances during our co-evolution, recent history suggests that populations only modernise and age well with low fertility on a suitably balanced diet.
32327922,Imbalances on the low meat side lead to an excess of infectious disease, short lives and boom-bust demographics.
32327922,On the high side, meat has led to an excess of degenerative, allergic and metabolic disease and low fertility.
32327922,A 'Goldilocks' diet derived from mixed and sustainable farming (preserving the topsoil) allows for high intellectual capital, height and good health with controlled population growth resulting in economic growth and prosperity.
32327922,Implementing meat equity worldwide could lead to progress for future generations on 'spaceship' earth by establishing control over population quality, thermostat and biodiversity, if it is not already too late.
32328118,Teams of epidemiological and medical &quot;detectives&quot; are working to get a coronavirus pandemic under control. <b>Ronald D.
32328118,Fricker, Jr</b> and <b>Steven E.
32328118,Rigdon</b> walk us through a typical investigation.
32328595,This paper is aimed at addressing the urgent need to develop a protocol that will address the operatory and clinical aspects of dental care during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
32328595,The epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, and modes of transmission of COVID-19 are presented.
32328595,This protocol was established as an international collaboration of three dental universities: Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, Israel; University of Rochester Medical Center, USA; and the University of Pennsylvania, USA.
32328595,This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors.
32328595,The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
32328595,The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects.
32328595,This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics.
32328595,Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.
32329044,Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system.
32329044,Seven types of coronavirus can infect humans.
32329044,Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies.
32329044,The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus).
32329044,Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32329044,Future epidemiological studies and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.
32329044,Complicaciones neurológicas por coronavirus y COVID-19.
32329044,Introducción.
32329044,Estudios clínicos y experimentales han demostrado que la familia de los coronavirus tiene un cierto tropismo por el sistema nervioso central.
32329044,Siete tipos de coronavirus pueden contagiar al ser humano.
32329044,Desarrollo.
32329044,Los coronavirus no siempre permanecen confinados en el tracto respiratorio, y en determinadas condiciones pueden invadir el sistema nervioso central y causar patologías neurológicas.
32329044,La capacidad potencial de neuroinvasión está bien documentada en la mayor parte de los coronavirus humanos (OC-43, 229E, MERS y SARS) y en algunos coronavirus animales (coronavirus de la encefalomielitis hemaglutinante porcina).
32329044,Se han descrito síntomas neurológicos en pacientes afectos por COVID-19, como cefalea, mareo, mialgias y anosmia, así como casos de encefalopatía, encefalitis, encefalopatía necrotizante hemorrágica, ictus, crisis epilépticas, rabdomiólisis y síndrome de Guillain-Barré, asociados a la infección por el SARS-CoV-2.
32329044,Conclusiones.
32329044,Futuros estudios epidemiológicos y registros de casos deben elucidar la incidencia real de estas complicaciones neurológicas, sus mecanismos patogénicos y sus opciones terapéuticas.
32329046,The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is forcing neurologists to carry out a series of adaptations in the management of multiple sclerosis.
32329046,Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity.
32329046,Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist.
32329046,The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32329046,This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context.
32329046,After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.
32329046,The neurologist should be aware of current evidence to assess the risk-benefit of starting, maintaining and stopping disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.

32329046,Introducción.
32329046,La pandemia actual por el SARS-CoV-2 está obligando a los neurólogos a una serie de adaptaciones en el manejo de la esclerosis múltiple.
32329046,Los neurólogos deben sopesar la necesidad de iniciar o continuar los tratamientos modificadores de la enfermedad en función del riesgo de infección, del riesgo de complicaciones de la infección y del riesgo de actividad de la esclerosis múltiple.
32329046,Dado que ésta es una situación sin precedentes, la mayoría de las decisiones se están tomando sobre la base de un abordaje teórico y del criterio de cada neurólogo.
32329046,Objetivos.
32329046,Se pretende, a través de una búsqueda bibliográfica, recopilar la evidencia disponible sobre la relación entre tratamientos modificadores de la enfermedad en la esclerosis múltiple y la infección por el SARS-CoV-2.
32329046,Esta evidencia, junto con la experiencia de los autores en el manejo de pacientes con esclerosis múltiple durante la pandemia, permitirá brindar algunas propuestas de tratamiento y seguimiento de los pacientes en este contexto epidemiológico.
32329046,Desarrollo.
32329046,Después de la búsqueda bibliográfica y de nuestra experiencia en el manejo de pacientes, se establecen unas propuestas de tratamiento sobre cada fármaco que necesariamente han de individualizarse para cada paciente, ya que, en esta circunstancia excepcional, sus peculiaridades pueden marcar el pronóstico.
32329046,Conclusiones.
32329046,El neurólogo debe tener conocimiento de la evidencia actual para valorar el riesgo-beneficio de iniciar, mantener y suspender los tratamientos modificadores de la enfermedad en la esclerosis múltiple durante la pandemia.
32329275,The SARS-CoV-2 has been spread to 26 countries around the world since its outbreak.
32329275,By February 16, 2020, more than 68 000 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19.
32329275,Researchers from all over the world have carried out timely studies on this public health emergency and produced a number of scientific publications.
32329275,This review aims to re-analyze and summarize the current research findings in a timely manner to guide scholars in relevant fields to further SARS-CoV-2 research and assist healthcare professionals in their work and decision-making.
32329275,The SARS-CoV-2 related terms were selected in both English and Chinese and were searched in several major databases, including Pubmed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases.
32329275,The reference list of each search result was screened for relevance, which was further supplemented to the search results.

32329275,The number of publications has rapidly increased since mid-January, 2020, and a peak day was 6th February on which 50 articles were published.
32329275,The top three countries publishing articles were China, the United States and the United Kingdom.
32329275,The <i>Lancet</i> and its specialty journals have published the most articles, with contribution also from journals such as <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> ( <i>NEJM</i>), <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i> ( <i>JAMA</i>), and <i>Nature</i>.
32329275,All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention &amp; control, and others.
32329275,The literatures related to SARS-CoV-2 are emerging rapidly.
32329275,It is necessary to sort out and summarize the research topic in time, which has a good reference value for staff in different positions.
32329275,At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the judgment of the quality of literatures.

32329877,SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of severe respiratory illness (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China and is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.
32329877,The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation.
32329877,In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite.
32329877,Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
32329877,Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.
32329877,Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted.
32329877,However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2.
32329877,Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
32329877,Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.
32329877,Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.
32330439,Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment.
32330439,We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19.
32330439,In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases.
32330439,Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing.
32330439,When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection.
32330439,Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering.
32330439,The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020.
32330439,All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative.
32330439,This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing.
32330439,ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320.
32330439,Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore.
32330439,Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

32330458,When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance.
32330458,Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions.
32330458,We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
32330458,We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave.
32330458,We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day.
32330458,We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic.
32330458,From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China.
32330458,We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7·1 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·8-10·9) from version 1 to 2, 2·8 times (1·9-4·2) from version 2 to 4, and 4·2 times (2·6-7·3) from version 4 to 5.
32330458,If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000-359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported.
32330458,The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases.
32330458,These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

32331343,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) appears to have a higher mortality rate in presence of comorbidities and in men.
32331343,The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility.
32331343,An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32331343,ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium.
32331343,Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17ß-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney.
32331343,Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy.
32331343,In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition.
32331343,Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies.
32331343,Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.
32331509,The 2019-2020 pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has inundated hospital systems globally, as they prepare to accommodate surge of patients requiring advanced levels of care.
32331509,Pandemic preparedness has not been this urgently and widely needed in the last several decades.
32331509,According to epidemiologic predictions, the peak of this pandemic has still not been reached, and hospitals everywhere need to ensure readiness to care for more patients than they usually do, and safety for healthcare workers who strive to save lives.
32331509,We share our hospital-wide rapid preparedness and response to COVID-19 to help provide information to other healthcare systems globally.
32331787,COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was reported by the world health organization in late December 2019.
32331787,As an unexplained respiratory disease epidemic, which is similar to respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV, it rapidly spread all over the world.
32331787,The study aims to compare several parameters of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV infectious diseases in terms of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates.
32331787,The publicly available dataset Worldometer (extracted on April 5, 2020) confirmed by WHO report was available for meta-analysis purposes using the Meta-MUMS tool.
32331787,And, the reported outcomes of the analysis used a random-effects model to evaluate the event rate, and risk ratios thorough subgroup analysis forest plots.
32331787,Seventeen countries for COVID-19 and eight countries of SARS infections, including COVID-19 group n = 1124243, and SARS-CoV group n = 8346, were analyzed.
32331787,In this meta-analysis, a random effect model of relations of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates of COVID-19 and SARS world infections were determined.
32331787,The meta-analysis and forest plots of two viral world infections showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 infection is more than SARS infections, while recovery and mortality event rates of SARS-CoV are more than COVID-19 infection.
32331787,And subgroup analysis showed that the mortality and recovery rates were higher in both SARS-CoV wand COVID-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively.
32331787,In conclusion, the meta-analysis approach on the abovementioned dataset revealed the epidemiological and statistical analyses for comparing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
32332481,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly spread across the world.
32332481,As medical systems continue to develop vaccines and treatments, it is crucial for the public health community to establish nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can effectively mitigate the rate of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread across highly populated residential areas, especially among individuals who have close contact with confirmed cases.
32332481,A community-driven preparedness strategy has been implemented in metropolitan areas in China.
32332481,The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) has required that all COVID-19 confirmed cases be recorded and documented in a national notifiable disease surveillance system (NDSS).
32332481,After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation.
32332481,A task force performs home visits to infected individuals.
32332481,Persons under investigation (PUIs) can stay in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days or in special circumstances can be quarantined at home.
32332481,This community-based approach involved all stakeholders including local public health departments, public safety authorities, neighborhood councils, and community health centers.
32333285,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread not only in China but throughout the world.
32333285,Children with kidney failure (chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5) are at significant risk for COVID-19.
32333285,In turn, a set of recommendations for the prevention and control of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 in pediatric hemodialysis (HD) centers and in home peritoneal dialysis (PD) settings have been proposed.
32333285,The recommendations are based on the epidemiological features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease, susceptibility factors, and preventive and control strategies.
32333285,These recommendations will be updated as new information regarding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 becomes available.
32333993,In the present study we analyze the epidemiological data of COVID-19 of Tibet and high-altitude regions of Bolivia and Ecuador, and compare to lowland data, to test the hypothesis that high-altitude inhabitants (+2,500 m above sea-level) are less susceptible to develop severe adverse effects in acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
32333993,Analysis of available epidemiological data suggest that physiological acclimatization/adaptation that counterbalance the hypoxic environment in high-altitude may protect from severe impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
32333993,Potential underlying mechanisms such as: (i) a compromised half-live of the virus caused by the high-altitude environment, and (ii) a hypoxia mediated down regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main binding target of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the pulmonary epithelium are discussed.
32334904,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff.
32334904,To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.
32334904,Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020.
32334904,The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method.
32334904,The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes.
32334904,First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members.
32334904,Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition.
32334904,Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection.
32334904,Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions.
32334904,During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted.
32334904,In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually.
32334904,Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.
32335167,Face mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial.
32335167,We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
32335167,Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol.
32335167,Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings.
32335167,The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking.
32335167,Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored.
32335167,Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR.
32335167,The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S.
32335167,(1102.8), U.K.
32335167,(831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5).
32335167,The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%).
32335167,We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational 'mask-off' settings compared to only 3 in workplace 'mask-on' settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit).
32335167,Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19.
32335171,Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has been spread throughout China before becoming a global pandemic.
32335171,In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases.
32335171,We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families.
32335171,Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed.
32335171,Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations.
32335171,Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms.
32335171,The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days.
32335171,A prolonged period of virus shedding (&gt;30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases.
32335171,SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters.
32335171,While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly.
32335171,We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.
32335334,Considering the current pandemic of COVID-19, it is imperative to gauge the role of molecular divergence in SARS-CoV-2 with time, due to clinical and epidemiological concerns.
32335334,Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism.
32335334,As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation.
32335334,We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome.
32335334,We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.
32335337,The prevalence of hypertension is high in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and it appears to be related to an increased risk of mortality, as shown in many epidemiological studies.
32335337,The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system is not uniformly expressed in all of the human races, and current differences could explain some of the geographical discrepancies in infection around the world.
32335337,Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19.
32335337,As two-thirds of hypertensive patients take ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current antihypertensive drugs in COVID-19.
32335337,This report summarizes the recent evidence for and against the administration of ACE blockade in the COVID-19 era.
32335407,On 10 April 2020, Iran reported 68,192 COVID-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases.
32335407,Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus.
32335407,On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus.
32335407,The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix.
32335407,This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran.
32335407,For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized.
32335407,Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed.
32335407,The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively.
32335407,Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.
32335407,Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.
32335628,In December 2019, the world was disrupted by the news of a new strain of virus known as Novel Corona virus, taking lives of many in China.
32335628,Wuhan, the capital of Central China's Hubei province is said to be the place where the outbreak started.
32335628,The city went on a lockdown as the disease spread rapidly.
32335628,After the lockdown, most countries like India and Bangladesh airlifted their citizens who were studying in Wuhan.
32335628,Similarly, Nepal also has many youth studying medicine in Wuhan.
32335628,Pleas for help from the students reached the government.
32335628,This was a first encounter of such experience for Nepal government.
32335628,With the help of Health Emergency Organizing committee, Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Nepal Army Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Waste Management team, Nepal Ambulance service, Tribhuwan Airport and Royal Airlines the government of Nepal planned, organized and successfully brought back all the 175 students on 15 the February, 2019 from Wuhan, China.
32335628,The aim of the present article is to share the experience, the challenges faced and recommendations for future similar cases.
32335628,Keywords: evacuation; Nepal; Novel Corona virus; Wuhan.
32335749,In this rapid commentary, a mini-review is given of the present state-of-knowledge regarding the etiology and epidemiology of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and the risks for developing Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32335749,The available knowledge on the viral genomics, molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses of the Coronaviridae family and other Nidovirales, forms a helpful template for understanding the present pandemic outbreak.
32335749,However, important questions remain unanswered about the underlying mechanism causing the very high case fatality ratios (CFR) and mechanisms regarding severe reactions like ARDS, fatal cardiac and renal failures, associated with a number of important comorbidity factors.
32335749,Immunological reactions to lung alveoles in particular (involving lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cell damage) in late phase ARDS in SARS-like CoV diseases, so far may not have received enough attention.
32335749,Finally a shortlist of questions for high priority further research is suggested.
32336243,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread to more than 200 other countries around the world.
32336243,COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease with continuous human-to-human transmission.
32336243,The origin of the virus is unknown.
32336243,Airway manipulations and intubations, which are common during anesthesia procedures may increasingly expose anesthesia providers and intensive care unit team members to SARS-CoV-2.
32336243,Through a comprehensive review of existing studies on COVID-19, this article presents the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, reviews current medical management, and suggests ways to improve the safety of anesthetic procedures.
32336243,Owing to the highly contagious nature of the virus and the lack of therapeutic drugs or vaccines, precautions should be taken to prevent medical staff from COVID-19.
32336802,The explosion of Covid-19 cases is looming in Germany.
32336802,The German Society for Epidemiology has warned that the number of cases could soon overshoot the capacity of the healthcare system.
32336802,This may be true even if Germany follows the 'flatten-the-curve'- approach to reduce infection rates.
32336802,A suppression of the virus remains the best solution for the crisis.
32336802,Supply will suffer as long the virus persists.
32336802,Until then, demand side measures will not cure the epidemic.
32336802,Coordinated measures for business that ensure compliance and European debt instruments may be part of a strategy to solve the crisis.
32336927,In late December 2019, the world woke to a reality of a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), elicited by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to a group of β-coronavirus.
32336927,The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).
32336927,In the last two decades, this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, following SARS which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) from 2012 till date.
32336927,Globally and as of April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities.
32336927,While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China.
32336927,SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats.
32336927,Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures.
32336927,This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.
32336957,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging zoonotic viral infection, which was started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and transmitted to other countries worldwide as a pandemic outbreak.
32336957,Iran is one of the top ranked countries in the tables of COVID-19-infected and -mortality cases that make the Iranian patients as the potential targets for diversity of studies including epidemiology, biomedical, biodata, and viral proteins computational modelling studies.
32336957,In this study, we applied bioinformatic biodata mining methods to detect CDS and protein sequences of ORF1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from oronasopharynx of an Iranian patient.
32336957,Then through the computational modelling and antigenicity prediction approaches, the identified polyprotein sequence was analyzed.
32336957,The results revealed that the identified ORF1ab polyprotein belongs to a part of nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) with the high antigenicity residues in a glycine-proline or hydrophobic amino acid rich domain.
32336957,The results revealed that nsp1 as a virulence factor and crucial agent in spreading of the COVID-19 among the society can be a potential target for the future epidemiology, drug, and vaccine studies.
32336959,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the globe, and millions of people may be affected.
32336959,While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features and diagnostic tools of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving, uncertainties surrounding various aspects of its optimal management strategies persist.
32336959,A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
32336959,Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs.
32336959,The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury.
32336959,As we await more data from treating these patients, this strategy is likely to help reduce potential complications.
32337131,The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has gained global attention after it originated from China at the end of 2019, and later turned into pandemic as it affected about 118,000 in 114 countries by March 11, 2020.
32337131,By March 13, 2020, it was declared a national emergency in the United States as the number of COVID-19 cases, and the death toll rose exponentially.
32337131,To contain the spread of the disease, the world scientist community came together.
32337131,However, the unpreparedness of the nations, even with the advanced medical sciences and resources, has failed to address the mental health aspect amongst the public, as all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32337131,Our efforts in this review are to evaluate and study similar outbreaks from the past to understand its adverse impact on mental health, implement adequate steps to tackle and provide a background to physicians and healthcare workers at the time of such outbreaks to apply psychological first aid.
32337201,The first case of pneumonia subsequently attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province on December 8, 2019.
32337201,The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties.
32337201,A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus.
32337201,A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea.
32337201,She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties.
32337201,A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs.
32337201,The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years.
32337201,Her blood pressure was well controlled.
32337201,On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17.
32337201,The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction.
32337201,However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out.
32337201,A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia.
32337201,Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
32337201,Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19.
32337201,Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.
32337584,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was initially detected in China in December 2019.
32337584,Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed.
32337584,Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of Münster (UHM).
32337584,Single-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts.
32337584,Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews.
32337584,In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms.
32337584,Threshold cycle (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.
32337584,Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak.
32337584,Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections.
32337584,Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic.
32337584,Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results.
32337584,Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007).
32337584,Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at the UHM.
32337584,Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting.
32337584,Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.
32339231,Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 broke out in Wuhan in December 2019.
32339231,We utilized confirmed cases outside Hubei Province to analyze epidemiologic characteristics and evaluate the effect of traffic restrictions implemented in Hubei beginning on January 23, 2020.
32339231,Information on 7,015 confirmed cases from January 19 to February 8, 2020, in all provinces outside Hubei was collected from the national and local health commissions in China.
32339231,Incubation period and interval times were calculated using dates of the following events: contact with an infected person, onset, first visit and diagnosis.
32339231,We evaluated changes in incubation period and interval times.
32339231,The average age of all cases was 44.24 years old.
32339231,The median incubation period was 5 days and extended from 2 days on January 23 to 15 days on February 8.
32339231,The proportion of imported cases decreased from 85.71% to 33.19% after January 23.
32339231,In addition, the lengths of the intervals between onset and diagnosis, onset and first visit, and first visit and diagnosis decreased over time.
32339231,Rapidly transmitting COVID-19 has a short incubation period.
32339231,The onset mainly occurs among young to middle-aged adults.
32339231,Traffic restrictions played an important role in the decreased number of imported cases outside Hubei.
32339662,The full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown.
32339662,This perspective paper reviews the following: current COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential therapies; care considerations unique to HCT recipients; and the concept of a learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices and to optimize patient outcomes through facilitating shared learning and experience across transplantation centers.
32339960,Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has spread in the world rapidly.
32339960,Population have a susceptibility to COVID-19, older people were more susceptible to have a variety diseases than younger, including COVID-19 infection with no doubt.
32339960,This study focused on older patients with COVID-19 infection and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them.
32339960,We collected information on confirmed older patient transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) to the designated hospitals from Jan 20 to Feb 29, 2020.
32339960,The information including demographic, epidemiological, clinical, classification of severity and outcomes.
32339960,All cases were categorized into three groups and compared the difference between aged 50-64 years, 65-79 years and older than 80 years.
32339960,56.7 % of elderly confirmed patients were male, fever (78.3 %), cough (56.7 %), dyspnea (30.0 %), and fatigue (23.3 %) were common symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
32339960,Classification of severity has statistically significant differences between the three groups, compared with middle-aged patients and aged 65-79 years group, older than 80 years group had significant statistical differences in contacted to symptomatic case in 14 days.
32339960,As of Feb 29, 38.3 % patients had discharged and 53.3 % patients remained in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in elderly was 8.3 %.
32339960,The COVID-19 infection is generally susceptible with a relatively high fatality rate in older patients, we should pay more attention to the elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.

32340093,<b>结论：</b> 这是一起聊城市某超市输入性病例引起COVID-19聚集性疫情，提示聚集性疫情防控工作重点在于社区传播链和家庭聚集性病例，还需关注无症状感染者的传播风险。.
32340095,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical courses and outcomes of COVID-19 cases and the influencing factors in Guangdong province and provide basis for the formulation or adjustment of medical care and epidemic control strategy for COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We collected demographic data, medical histories, clinical courses and outcomes of 1 350 COVID-19 patients reported in Guangdong as of 4 March 2020 via epidemiological investigation and process tracking.
32340095,Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. <b>Results:</b> Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal.
32340095,The median duration of illness were 23 days (<i>P</i>(25)-<i>P</i>(75): 18-31 days) and the median length of hospitalization were 20 days (<i>P</i>(25)-<i>P</i>(75): 15-27 days).
32340095,For severe cases, the median time of showing severe manifestations was on the 12th day after onset (<i>P</i>(25)-<i>P</i>(75): 9th to 15th days), and the median time of severe manifestation lasted for 8 days <i>P</i>(25)-<i>P</i>(75): 4-14 days).
32340095,Among 1 066 discharged/fetal cases, 36.4% (36/99) and 1.0% (1/99) of the mild cases developed to ordinary cases and severe cases respectively after admission; and 5.2% (50/968) and 0.6% (6/968) of the ordinary cases developed to severe cases, and critical cases respectively after admission.
32340095,In severe cases, 11.4% developed to critical cases (10/88).
32340095,The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (a<i>HR</i>=1.87, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.43-2.46), older age (a<i>HR</i>=1.67, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (a<i>HR</i>=1.73, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (a<i>HR</i>=1.75, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (a<i>HR</i>=1.49, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.06-2.09). <b>Conclusions:</b> The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes.
32340095,The severe cases were mainly occurred in populations at high risk.
32340095,In the epidemic period, classified management of COVID-19 cases should be promoted according to needs for control and prevention of isolation and treatment for the purpose of rational allocation of medical resources. <b>目的：</b> 分析广东省新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）病例的临床转归及其影响因素，为优化医疗救治及疫情防控的策略提供参考依据。
32340095,<b>方法：</b> 通过流行病学调查和进程追踪，收集广东省截至2020年3月4日COVID-19确诊病例1 350例的基本人口学特征、既往病史、就诊经过和临床转归等信息，分析确诊病例的临床分型、病程特点及其相关影响因素。
32340095,<b>结果：</b> 广东省COVID-19确诊病例1 350例中，临床分型为轻型、普通型、重型和危重型（重症）分别为5.3%（72/1 350）、77.7%（1 049/1 350）、12.1%（164/1 350）和4.3%（58/1 350），粗死亡率为0.5%（7/1 350）。

32340095,<b>结论：</b> 广东省COVID-19病例病程和住院时间普遍较长，且与其临床分型严重程度有关，重症病例主要集中在特定人群，在疫情高发时期，为确保医疗资源的合理配置，需根据隔离和救治等防控需求对病例分类管理。.
32340097,We compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and COVID-19 and found that COVID-19 was more contagious, more concealed in transmission, with greater infectious intensity and more severe clinical manifestations.
32340097,If the COVID-19 epidemic is not effectively controlled, it will have a serious impact on human health, and even social development.
32340097,Recognizing the characteristics of three diseases, especially COVID-19, and improving the disease awareness of COVID-19 will help better implement the guidelines of &quot;scientific prevention and treatment, precise implementation&quot; and prevent and control COVID-19.
32340097,本文对严重急性呼吸系统综合征（SARS）、2009—2010年的甲型H1N1（2009年）大流行性流感（简称甲型H1N1大流感）和新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）流行病特征和临床特征进行了比较。
32340097,与另外两种疾病相比，COVID-19传染性更强、传播更隐蔽、传染强度更大、临床表现更严重。
32340097,如果COVID-19疫情得不到有效控制，对人类健康、乃至社会发展都将产生严重的影响。
32340097,认识三种疾病尤其是COVID-19的特征，提高对COVID-19的危害性认识，对贯彻&quot;科学防治，精准施策&quot;指导方针，做好COVID-19的防控具有一定的意义。.
32340347,The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world.
32340347,In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth.
32340347,However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person.
32340347,Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts.
32340347,Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form.
32340347,Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission.
32340347,On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion.
32340347,Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital.
32340347,On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations.
32340347,The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet).
32340347,The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.
32340751,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 represents a special risk for renal patients due to their comorbidities and advanced age.
32340751,The usual performance of hemodialysis treatments in collective rooms increases the risk.
32340751,The specific information at this time in this regard is very limited.
32340751,This manuscript includes a proposal for action to prevent infection in the Nephrology Services, and in particular in Hemodialysis Units, with the objective of early identification of patients who meet the definition of a suspected case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and propose circuits and mechanisms to carry out hemodialysis treatments.
32340751,They are recommendations in continuous review and can be modified if the epidemiological situation, the diagnostic and therapeutic options so require.
32340833,In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32340833,On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32340833,As of February 14, 2020, 49,053 laboratory-confirmed and 1,381 deaths have been reported globally.
32340833,Perceived risk of acquiring disease has led many governments to institute a variety of control measures.
32340833,We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic.
32340833,In this literature review, the causative agent, pathogenesis and immune responses, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and management of the disease, control and preventions strategies are all reviewed.
32343514,Healthcare worker (HCW) safety is of pivotal importance during a pandemic such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and employee health and well-being ensures functionality of healthcare institutions.
32343514,This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU) where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced.
32343514,In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease epidemic into account.
32343514,Various staffing models were constructed and comprehensive statistical modeling performed.
32343514,A typical, routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 hours/week) in a 40 bed ICU with a 2:1 ratio of patients to staff.
32343514,The pandemic model assumed staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week.
32343514,Potential in-hospital staff infections were constructed for a total period of 120 days with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work.
32343514,Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality once infected, and the quarantine time, if infected.
32343514,Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased.
32343514,Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively.
32343514,Staffing along epidemiologic considerations may reduce HCW shortage by leveling the nadir from affected workforce.
32343514,Although this requires considerable efforts and commitment of staff, it may be essential in an effort to best maintain staff health and operational functionality of healthcare facilities and systems.
32343939,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 19 April 2020: notifications = 6,606; deaths = 69.
32343939,The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease.
32343939,Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
32343939,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked.
32343939,The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
32343939,The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%).
32343939,The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases.
32343939,High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission.
32343939,Internationally, cases continue to increase.
32343939,The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.
32343939,Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.
32343948,Validation studies of serological antibody tests must be properly designed for clinical, epidemiological and Public Health objectives such as confirmation of suspected COVID-19 cases, certification of seroconversion after infection, and epidemiological surveillance.
32343948,We evaluated the kinetics of IgM, IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients with confirmed (rRT-PCR) infection.
32343948,We found that the IgA response appears and grows early, peaks at week 3, and it is stronger and more persistent than the IgM response.
32343948,Further longitudinal investigations of virus-specific antibodies functions and of their protective efficacy over time are needed.
32344317,The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-Cov-2 or COVID-19 has become a worldwide threat and the major healthcare concern of the year 2020.
32344317,Cancer research was directly affected by the emerging of this disease.
32344317,According to some Chinese studies, cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications.
32344317,This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations.
32344317,Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population.
32344317,In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population.
32344317,Finally, we focus on strategies that are followed in cancer management with review of national and international guidelines.
32344439,The new pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) poses immense challenges to health care systems worldwide.
32344439,In the current manuscript we summarize the strategies, organisational approaches and actions of the Task-force Coronavirus at the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32344439,We also report on experiences with implementation of these approaches and treatment outcomes in the first 115 COVID patients.
32344439,Retrospective, narrative process description and analysis of the time period between end of January and beginning of April 2020, performed by representatives of the involved departments and institutes.
32344439,Additionally a retrospective observational cohort study with descriptive analysis of epidemiological and clinical data of COVID patients admitted until March 31st was performed.
32344439,A multidisciplinary Task-force Coronavirus initiated measures concerning outpatient testing and counseling, reorganisation and separation of patient flow processes alongside with substantial escalation of inpatient capacities on regular wards and intensive care units.
32344439,Within the framework of the resulting dynamic care model, 115 patients suffering from COVID could be treated without shortages in staff or bed capacities.
32344439,In the upcoming pandemic, adequate COVID management and care could be secured by a collaborative approach with inclusion of administrative departments, clinical disciplines and theoretical institutes of the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32344439,Das neue, pandemische Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 und die damit einhergehende Erkrankung COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) stellt die medizinischen Versorgungssysteme vor große Herausforderungen.
32344439,Die vorliegende Arbeit fasst die Strategie, Organisation und Maßnahmen der COVID-Taskforce des Universitätsklinikums Freiburg zusammen und berichtet über Erfahrungen und Behandlungsergebnisse von der Versorgung der ersten 115 COVID-19-Patienten.
32344439,Retrospektive, narrative Prozessbeschreibung und -analyse des Zeitraums Ende Januar bis Anfang April 2020, durchgeführt unter Mitwirken der beteiligten Departments, Kliniken und Institute des Universitätsklinikums Freiburg.
32344439,Ergänzend erfolgte eine retrospektive Beobachtungsstudie mit deskriptiver statistischer Auswertung der epidemiologischen und klinischen Daten aller bis 31.
32344439,März 2020 hospitalisierten COVID-19-Patienten.
32344439,Durch eine interdisziplinär zusammengesetzte Taskforce Coronavirus wurden Maßnahmen in den Bereichen ambulante Testung und Beratung, Separierung der Patientenströme sowie Eskalation der Versorgungskapazitäten auf Normal- und Intensivstationen im Sinne eines dynamischen Stufenmodells angeregt und umgesetzt.
32344439,Die Versorgung der ersten 115 Patienten gelang somit ohne Entstehung von Engpässen.
32344439,Durch Zusammenwirken sämtlicher Disziplinen und Abteilungen des Universitätsklinikums Freiburg konnte eine adäquate Versorgung von COVID-19-Patienten sichergestellt und die Handlungsfähigkeit des Klinikums in der aktuellen Ausbruchsituation erhalten werden.
32345443,In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).
32345443,The knowledge about the virus is still limited, but as the pandemic progresses and the physiopathology of the disease is understood, new evidence is being massively published.
32345443,Surgical specialists are facing an unprecedented situation: they must collaborate in the ER or medical wards attending these patients, while still needing to make decisions about surgical patients with probable COVID-19.
32345443,The present narrative review aims to summarize the most relevant aspects and synthetize concepts on COVID-19 for surgeons.
32345446,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019, it has spread to various regions and countries, forming a global pandemic.
32345446,Reducing nosocomial infection is a new issue and challenge for all healthcare systems.
32345446,Otolaryngology is a high-risk specialty as it close contact with upper respiratory tract mucous, secretions, droplets and aerosols during procedures and surgery.
32345446,Therefore, infection prevention and control measures for this specialty are essential.
32345446,Literatures on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and infection control measures of COVID-19 were reviewed, practical knowledge from first-line otolaryngologists in China, the United States, and Brazil were reviewed and collated.
32345446,It was recommended that otolaryngology professionals should improve screening in suspected patients with relevant nasal and pharyngeal symptoms and signs, suspend non-emergency consultations and examinations in clinics, and rearrange the working procedures in operating rooms.
32345446,The guidelines of personal protective equipment for swab sampling, endoscopy and surgery were listed.
32345446,Indications for tracheotomy during the pandemic should be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary airway opening and aerosol-generation; precautions during surgery to reduce the risk of exposure and infection were illustrated.
32345446,This review aimed to provide recommendations for otolaryngologists to enhance personal protection against COVID-19 and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.
32346492,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019.
32346492,The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern.
32346492,Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease.
32346492,In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication.
32346492,Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis.
32346492,Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19.
32346492,This protocol is divided into four major steps.
32346492,The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification.
32346492,The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19.
32346492,The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification.
32346492,The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification.
32346492,It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.
32346664,At the beginning of a COVID-19 infection, there is a period of time known as the exposed or latency period, before an infected person is capable of transmitting the infection to another person.
32346664,We develop two differential equations models to account for this period.
32346664,The first is a model that incorporates infected persons in the exposed class, before transmission is possible.
32346664,The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible.
32346664,We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China.
32346664,We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases.
32346664,We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic.
32346873,Few studies reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course.
32346873,We investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 without any symptoms.
32346873,Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively recruited.
32346873,The demographic characteristics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without any symptoms were analyzed.
32346873,Fifteen (4.4%) of 342 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients did not develop any symptom during the course of the disease.
32346873,The median time from exposure to diagnosis was 7.0 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.0-15.0 days).
32346873,Of the 15 patients, 14 patients were diagnosed by tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, while one patient was only tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in anal swabs.
32346873,During hospitalization, only 1 (6.7%) patient developed lymphopenia.
32346873,Abnormalities of chest computed tomography examinations were detected in 8 (53.4%) patients on admission.
32346873,As of 8 March 2020, all patients have been discharged.
32346873,The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR: 4.0-9.0 days).
32346873,Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.
32346873,Asymptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have favorable outcomes.
32347198,BackgroundCOVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China and subsequently developed into an ongoing epidemic.
32347198,Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance.AimsThis study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.MethodsWe extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection.
32347198,We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation.
32347198,A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay.
32347198,Secondary attack rate was also estimated.ResultsThe empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81).
32347198,Containment delay increased significantly over time.
32347198,Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay.
32347198,The empirical serial interval was 4.58-6.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector-infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation.
32347198,The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.
32347198,ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement.
32347198,Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.
32347204,BackgroundThe ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has major impacts on health systems, the economy and society.
32347204,Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions.
32347204,We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making.AimOur objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies.MethodsWe developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32347204,We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT<sub>90</sub>) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls.ResultsIgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT<sub>90</sub> were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls.
32347204,We found that PRNT<sub>90</sub> tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge.
32347204,Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test.ConclusionUsing IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT<sub>90</sub>, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies.
32347685,More than a million and a half people are infected worldwide with more than 90.000 casualties.
32347685,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is radically altering both socio-economic and health care scenarios.
32347685,On April 4, 2020, at 13.30 CET, a webinar was broadcasted, organized by Global Neuro and supported by WFNS.
32347685,Expert neurosurgeons from 6 different countries (China, Italy, South Korea, USA, Colombia and United Kingdom) reported on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health care systems and neurosurgical activity.
32347685,The first part focused on the epidemiology until that date.
32347685,The USA were the most affected State with 450.000 cases, followed by Italy (140.000 cases and 19.000 casualties), China (83.305 cases and 3.345 had died), South Korea (10.156 cases with 177 casualties), the UK (38.168 cases and 3.605 deaths) and Colombia (1.267 cases and 25 deaths).
32347685,The second part concerned Institution and staff reorganization.
32347685,In every country all surgical plans have been modified.
32347685,In Wuhan the staff was enrolled in COVID-units.
32347685,In New York, the Mount Sinai Health System was in lockdown mode.
32347685,In South Korea, sterilizing chambers have been placed.
32347685,In Italy some Departments were reorganized in a Hub and Spoke fashion.
32347685,In the Latin American region, they adopted special measures for every case.
32347685,In the UK a conference center has been used to accommodate intensive care unit (ICU) beds.
32347685,The third part was about neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32347685,In Wuhan the main hospital was used for urgent non-COVID patients.
32347685,In New York the neurosurgeon staff work in ICU as advanced practitioner (APP).
32347685,In South Korea every patient is screened.
32347685,In Italy the on-duty Hub neurosurgeons have been doubled.
32347685,In the Latin American region recommendations have been developed by some neurosurgical societies.
32347685,In the UK local non-specialists and traumatologists neurosurgical experts are collaborating in terms of best practice.
32347685,The final part touched upon how to perform safe surgery and re-start after the pandemic.
32347685,In China elective surgical procedures are performed very carefully.
32347685,In New York, surgery planning will be based on patient's viral load.
32347685,In South Korea and in Italy disinfection plans and negative-pressure O.R. were created.
32347685,In the Latin American region, the aim is to have a rapid testing system.
32347685,In the UK they have developed flowcharts to guide trauma patient management.
32347685,In general, the pandemic scenario was presented as a thought-provoking challenge in all countries which requires tireless efforts for both maintaining emergency and elective neurosurgical procedures.
32347772,In the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) had the second highest number of cases globally yet was able to dramatically lower the incidence of new cases and sustain a low mortality rate, making it a promising example of strong national response.
32347772,We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772,Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care.
32347772,Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
32347772,Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
32347772,Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772,South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
32347974,In 2002, China witnessed the emergence of a severe acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV.
32347974,Ten years later in 2012 a new version of the virus appeared in the Middle East known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus MERS-CoV.
32347974,At the end of 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) recorded a pneumonia of unknown causes.
32347974,Epidemiologically, the pneumonia was linked to a wet animal and seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, later Known by COVID-19.
32347974,The COVID-19 is a global pandemic infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32347974,Till now the total number of confirmed cases is 2,709,483 in over 225 countries around the world.
32347974,A recent report indicates that obesity may responsible for increasing the mortality of COVID-19 in Italy rather than in China.
32347974,Here we would like to shed light on a new suggestion to decrease the mortality rate of COVID-19.

32348166,With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation.
32348166,We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACEIs on COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study.
32348166,126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls.
32348166,In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison.
32348166,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups.
32348166,The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable.
32348166,Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure.
32348166,However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008).
32348166,Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% <i>vs</i> 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% <i>vs</i> 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.
32348166,Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.
32348545,Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease are poorly characterized.
32348545,To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data.
32348545,Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns.
32348545,We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis.
32348545,Lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (Pseudo-chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%).
32348545,Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms).
32348545,The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19.
32348545,Severity of COVID-19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to most severe in the latter groups.
32348545,Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings.
32348545,Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular).
32348545,We provide a description of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection.
32348545,These may help clinicians approach patients with the disease and recognize paucisymptomatic cases.
32348554,We wish to bring your attention to the PsoPROTECT (Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of Covid-19 infecTion) and SECURE-AD (Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion-Atopic Dermatitis) registries; two urgent global initiatives that address an unmet need for delineating the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes in the common cutaneous immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
32349120,Sudden, large-scale and diffuse human migration can amplify localized outbreaks of disease into widespread epidemics<sup>1-4</sup>.
32349120,Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative.
32349120,Here we use 11,478,484 counts of mobile phone data from individuals leaving or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout China.
32349120,First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement.
32349120,Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across all of China.
32349120,Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage.
32349120,Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations.
32349120,This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.
32349259,Epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are higher than those observed in China.
32349259,Our objective was to model the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak progression in Italian regions vs.
32349259,Lombardy to assess the epidemic's progression.
32349259,Our setting was Italy, and especially Lombardy, which is experiencing a heavy burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32349259,The peak of new daily cases of the epidemic has been reached on the 29th, while was delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones.
32349259,In our models, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection, both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day-by-day assessments based on single observations.
32349259,We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy.
32349259,The two methods provide an agreement of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series.
32349259,Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, each infected person in Lombardy has involved 4 other people (3.6 based on data of April 23rd) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68, as reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
32349259,According to our model, Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche will reach an R<sub>0</sub> value of up to 3.5.
32349259,The R<sub>0</sub> was 3.11 for Lazio and 3.14 for the Campania region, where the latter showed the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.11), Sicily (2.99), Abruzzo (3.0), Calabria (2.84), Basilicata (2.66), and Molise (2.6).
32349259,The R<sub>0</sub> value is decreased in Lombardy and the Northern regions, while it is increased in Central and Southern regions.
32349259,The expected peak of the SEIR model is set at the end of March, at a national level, with Southern Italian regions reaching the peak in the first days of April.
32349259,Regarding the strengths and limitations of this study, our model is based on assumptions that might not exactly correspond to the evolution of the epidemic.
32349259,What we know about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is based on Chinese data that seems to be different than those from Italy; Lombardy is experiencing an evolution of the epidemic that seems unique inside Italy and Europe, probably due to demographic and environmental factors.
32349382,Non-invasive remote health monitoring plays a vital role in epidemiological situations such as SARS outbreak (2003), MERS (2015) and the recently ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 because it is extremely risky to get close to the patient due to the spread of contagious infections.
32349382,Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes.
32349382,Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications.
32349382,IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution.
32349382,The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating.
32349382,This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate's health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging.
32349382,Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.
32349517,The outbreak caused by COVID-19 is causing a major challenge to clinical management and a worldwide threat to public health.
32349517,So far, there is no specific anti-coronavirus therapy approved for the treatment of COVID-19.
32349517,Recently, as the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely acknowledged, it has been brought to a crucial status by the public, governments, and World Health Organization (WHO).
32349517,For a better popularization of TCM, governments have made several advances in regulations and policies for treatment and measures of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32349517,Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like.
32349517,In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.
32349517,We would like to see these relevant studies, ranging from basic researches to clinical application, could provide some idea on effects of CHM to combat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses, and also offer new thinking for the exploration of therapeutic strategies under the guidance of TCM.
32349772,Recently, an outbreak of viral pneumonitis in Wuhan, Hubei, China successively spread as a global pandemia, led to the identification of a novel betacoronavirus species, the 2019 novel coronavirus, successively designated 2019-nCoV then SARS-CoV-2).
32349772,The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32349772,Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies.
32349772,This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.
32350584,This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of fracture in the elderly during the COVID-19.
32350584,This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020.
32350584,The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality.
32350584,SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis.
32350584,A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105).
32350584,For either males or females, 70-74 years was the most commonly involved age group.
32350584,A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home.
32350584,Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%.
32350584,Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453).
32350584,Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction.
32350584,Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).
32350584,These findings highlighted the importance of primary prevention (home prevention) measures and could be used for references for individuals, health care providers, or health administrative department during the global pandemic of COVID-19.
32350632,COronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread at unprecedented speed and scale into a global pandemic with cardiovascular risk factors and complications emerging as important disease modifiers.
32350632,We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19.
32350632,SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs.
32350632,Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
32350632,Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia.
32350632,The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive.
32350632,Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19.
32350632,Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.
32350773,The COVID-19 pandemic is reinforcing health inequities among vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM).
32350773,We conducted a rapid online survey (April 2 to April 13, 2020) of COVID-19 related impacts on the sexual health of 1051 US MSM.
32350773,Many participants had adverse impacts to general wellbeing, social interactions, money, food, drug use and alcohol consumption.
32350773,Half had fewer sex partners and most had no change in condom access or use.
32350773,Some reported challenges in accessing HIV testing, prevention and treatment services.
32350773,Compared to older MSM, those 15-24 years were more likely to report economic and service impacts.
32350773,While additional studies of COVID-19 epidemiology among MSM are needed, there is already evidence of emerging interruptions to HIV-related services.
32350773,Scalable remote solutions such as telehealth and mailed testing and prevention supplies may be urgently needed to avert increased HIV incidence among MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic era.
32350796,The current global outbreak of COVID-19 represents a major challenge in terms of epidemiology, contagiousness, treatment, as well as clinical and radiological behavior of this disease.
32350796,Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms.
32350796,According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays.
32350796,In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation.
32350796,Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement.
32350796,Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.
32351037,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32351037,As of 19 February 2020, there had been 333 confirmed cases reported in Shanghai, China.
32351037,This study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with COVID-19 in Shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference.
32351037,Among the 333 confirmed cases in Shanghai, 172 (51.7%) were males and 161 (48.3%) were females, with a median age of 50 years.
32351037,299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms.
32351037,139 (41.7%) and 111 (33.3%) cases were infected in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively.
32351037,148 (44.4%) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset, while 103 (30.9%) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in Wuhan.
32351037,The onset date of the first case in Shanghai was 28 December, with the peak appearing on 27 January.
32351037,The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 7.2 days.
32351037,207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization.
32351037,56 (18.6%) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 (42.9%) had increased C-reactive protein after onset.
32351037,Elderly, male and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia.
32351037,These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia.
32351037,Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia.
32351037,Time intervals from onset to visit, hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response.
32351037,Shanghai's experience proves that COVID-19 can be controlled well in megacities.
32351056,The outbreak of COVID-19 started in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
32351056,Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world.
32351056,In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu <sup>TM</sup> database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak.
32351056,We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus.
32351056,The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau ( <i>τ</i>) using the formula <i>t</i>= <i>τ</i>/2 <i>u</i>.
32351056,A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
32351056,Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation.
32351056,No combinations were detected.
32351056,The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups.
32351056,By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3.
32351056,The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019.
32351056,Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.
32351873,China has been fighting the epidemic of pneumonia-like diseases first detected for over a month in the city of Wuhan in December 2019.
32351873,The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide.
32351873,With a death toll approaching that of China's SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert.
32351873,Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak.
32351873,To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans.
32351873,This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
32351873,The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms.
32351873,This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission.
32351873,The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed.
32351873,Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.
32352202,The clinical presentation of European patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection is still unknown.
32352202,To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe.
32352202,Patients with positive diagnosis of Covid-19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals.
32352202,Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire.
32352202,Bayesian analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between outcomes. 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of health care workers).
32352202,The mean age of patients was 39.17±12.09 years.
32352202,The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%).
32352202,Fever was reported by on 45.4%.
32352202,The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5±5.7 days.
32352202,The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex.
32352202,Young patients more frequently had ear, nose, and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite.
32352202,Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients.
32352202,The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea.
32352202,Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients.
32352202,The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients.
32352202,Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.
32352314,COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, hitting hard on our communities.
32352314,As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn.
32352314,The course of an epidemic may be defined by a series of key factors.
32352314,In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection.
32352314,The basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection ('totally naïve'), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve.
32352314,Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect.
32352314,For <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, the number infected tends to increase, and for <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, transmission dies out.
32352314,Non-pharmaceutical strategies to handle the epidemic are sketched and based on current knowledge, the current situation is sketched and scenarios for the near future discussed.
32353347,Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China.
32353347,The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.
32353347,From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts.
32353347,We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital.
32353347,We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.
32353347,Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.
32353347,As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22).
32353347,Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1-5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1-2·7).
32353347,Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49-26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43-34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.
32353347,The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1-13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children &lt;10 years vs population average of 6·6%).
32353347,The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3-0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2-7·6).
32353347,Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.
32353347,This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R.
32353347,The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.
32353347,Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

32353762,An outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran has spread throughout the country.
32353762,Identifying the epidemiological characteristics of this disease will help to make appropriate decisions and thus control the epidemic.
32353762,The aim of this study was characterization of the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in Iran.
32353762,In this retrospective study, data related to the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 19 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 have been analyzed and reported.
32353762,Patient characteristics including age, gender and underlying diseases were investigated.
32353762,Data were collected through patient records.
32353762,Sex ratio, Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and daily trend of cases were also determined.
32353762,A multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed to assess affecting factors on mortality.
32353762,From February 19, 2020 to April 15, 2020, 12870 patients referred to the hospital emergency department, of which 2968 were hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis.
32353762,The majority of cases were in the age group of 50 to 60 years of old.
32353762,The male-to-female ratio was 1.93:1.
32353762,A total of 239 deaths occurred among all cases for an overall CFR of 1.85% based on the total number of patients (both outpatient and inpatient) and 8.06% among hospitalized patients.
32353762,Out of all patients 10.89% had comorbidity.
32353762,Diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic Kidney diseases and cancer were the most common comorbidities with 3.81, 2.02 , 1.99 , 1.25, 0.60 and 0.57 %, respectively.
32353762,Male gender (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.08-1.96), older age (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.04-1.06) and having underlying diseases (OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.24) were significantly associated with mortality.
32353762,The results of this study showed that Male gender, older age and having comorbidities were significantly associated with the risk of death among COVID-19 patients.
32353762,It is important to pay special attention to male elderly patients with underlying diseases.
32353825,Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results.
32353825,As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO.
32353825,COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker.
32353825,Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded.
32353825,The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol.
32353825,Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns.
32353825,Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19.
32353825,This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized.
32353825,All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection.
32353825,During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.
32353825,The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.
32353827,Low infection and case-fatality rates have been thus far observed in Taiwan.
32353827,One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation.
32353827,We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020.
32353827,The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons.
32353827,Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts.
32353827,National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2.
32353827,As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found.
32353827,Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020.
32353827,Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing.
32353857,COVID-19 has brought death and disease to large parts of the world.
32353857,Governments must deploy strategies to screen the population and subsequently isolate the suspect cases.
32353857,Diagnostic testing is critical for epidemiological surveillance, but the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and clinical utility (impact on health outcomes) of the current diagnostic methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection are not known.
32353857,I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis.
32353857,After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations.
32353857,I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in.
32353857,This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases.
32353857,COVID-19 ha traído muerte y enfermedad a gran parte del mundo.
32353857,Los gobiernos deben desplegar estrategias para tamizar la población y aislar los casos sospechosos.
32353857,Las pruebas diagnósticas son críticas en la vigilancia epidemiológica, pero no se conoce la exactitud (sensibilidad y especificidad) y la utilidad clínica (impacto sobre los desenlaces de salud) de los métodos diagnósticos actuales usados para la detección del SARS-CoV-2.
32353857,Realicé una búsqueda rápida en PubMed/MEDLINE para encontrar estudios sobre las pruebas diagnósticas de laboratorio y de diagnóstico viral rápido.
32353857,Después de correr las estrategias de búsqueda, encontré 47 artículos elegibles que son los que uso para esta revisión, en que comento las características de las pruebas y sus limitaciones.
32353857,No encontré artículos que aborden la utilidad clínica de las pruebas actualmente usadas para la detección del COVID-19, lo que implica que estamos librando una batalla sin tener un conocimiento adecuado de cuál es la proporción de falsos negativos que resultan de los tests que hoy se aplican.
32353857,No debemos ignorar esta dificultad, dado que podría obstaculizar los esfuerzos nacionales para contener la pandemia con arreglo a la aplicación de test diagnósticos a los casos sospechosos comunitarios.
32353991,On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a novel coronavirus disease in China that was later named COVID-19.
32353991,On 11 March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.
32353991,The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on 27 February 2020.
32353991,This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria.
32353991,We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector), and adjusted for disease importation.
32353991,By 11 April 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria.
32353991,At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with a doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28-15.18).
32353991,Separately for imported cases (travel-related) and local cases, the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively.
32353991,Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases.
32353991,The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65-8.41) at day 22 (19 March 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83-7.88) at day 25 (22 March 2020).
32353991,The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26-1.58).
32353991,These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.
32354360,In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported from Wuhan, China.
32354360,Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described.
32354360,We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients.
32354360,Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020.
32354360,Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected.
32354360,The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared.
32354360,Risk factors for death were analyzed.
32354360,A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
32354360,The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern.
32354360,Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates.
32354360,In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed.
32354360,During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted.
32354360,In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant.
32354360,By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia.
32354360,However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death.
32354360,Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness.
32354360,A period of 7-13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course.
32354360,Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.
32354565,Analyze a set of indicators to understand the variability of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in a set of selected countries.
32354565,Ecological study of a group of countries with more than 200 reported cases.
32354565,Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. and incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables.
32354565,In addition, a relative fatality index has been created.
32354565,Data are from international organizations.
32354565,Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations.
32354565,Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate.
32354565,Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables.
32354565,Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic.
32354565,Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary.
32355547,The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China.
32355547,Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful.
32355547,Farr's law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics.
32355547,Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr's law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence.
32355547,We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions.
32355547,A model based on Farr's law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward.
32355547,We observed 50,995 (37,001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020.
32355547,The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes.
32355547,If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city.
32355547,However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend.
32355547,The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models.
32355547,This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing.
32355547,However, there is a possibility of upward trend.
32355904,Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood.
32355904,We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious.
32355904,Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths.
32355904,Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures.
32355904,Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons <i>and</i> preventing asymptomatic transmission.
32355904,Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17-45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34-58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics.
32355904,Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9-18%).
32355904,Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic.
32355904,The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.
32356641,The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic has become the biggest challenge for the whole human community since many years.
32356641,It seems that the proper identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is the best strategy to limit the transmission.
32356641,However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, and symptoms may be very mild or atypical.
32356641,There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID‑19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms.
32356641,Moreover, SARS‑CoV‑2 particles were found in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of patients with COVID‑19.
32356641,These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
32356641,Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
32356641,Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
32356641,This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.
32357072,<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Previous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.
32357072,We aimed to further clarify the clinical characteristics of diabetes with COVID-19. <i> <b>Methods:</b> </i> Twenty-eight patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were enrolled from January 29, 2020, to February 10, 2020, with a final follow-up on February 22, 2020.
32357072,Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. <i> <b>Results:</b> </i> The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 ± 9.0 years.
32357072,Most (75%) patients were male.
32357072,Only 39.3% of the patients had a clear exposure of COVID-19.
32357072,Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%).
32357072,Fourteen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
32357072,The hemoglobin A1c level was similar between ICU and non-ICU patients.
32357072,ICU patients had a higher respiratory rate, higher levels of random blood glucose, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, creatine, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin I, D-dimers, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 than non-ICU patients.
32357072,Eleven of 14 ICU patients received noninvasive ventilation and 7 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation.
32357072,Twelve patients died in the ICU group and no patients died in the nonICU group. <i> <b>Conclusion:</b> </i> ICU cases showed higher rates of organ failure and mortality than non-ICU cases.
32357072,The poor outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 indicated that more supervision is required in these patients. <b>(Endocr Pract. 2020;26:xxx-xxx)</b>.
32357074,The severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 is an emerging viral pathogen responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic resulting in significant human morbidity and mortality.
32357074,Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death.
32357074,Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality.
32357074,Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32357074,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from American Society for Artificial Internal Organs.
32357074,Of note, this is a living document, which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges.
32357503,The current outbreak of COVID-19 severe respiratory disease, which started in Wuhan, China, is an ongoing challenge, and a major threat to public health that requires surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand this emergent pathogen and to develop an effective response.
32357503,Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines.
32357503,Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens.
32357503,Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights.
32357503,Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
32357503,In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
32357503,Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32357503,Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
32358232,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 is an emerging viral pathogen responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19 pandemic resulting in significant human morbidity and mortality.
32358232,Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death.
32358232,Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality.
32358232,Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32358232,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO.
32358232,Of note, this is a &quot;living document,&quot; which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges.
32359194,Spain has been one of the most affected countries by the COVID-19 outbreak.
32359194,As of April 28, 2020, the number of confirmed cases is 210 773, including 102 548 patients recovered, more than 10 300 admitted to the ICU, and 23 822 deaths, with a global case fatality rate of 11.3%.
32359194,From the perspective of donation and transplantation, the Spanish system first focused on safety issues, providing recommendations for donor evaluation and testing, and to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in potential recipients prior to transplantation.
32359194,Since the country entered into an epidemiological scenario of sustained community transmission and saturation of intensive care, developing donation and transplantation procedures has become highly complex.
32359194,Since the national state of alarm was declared in Spain on March 13, 2020, the mean number of donors has declined from 7.2 to 1.2 per day, and the mean number of transplants from 16.1 to 2.1 per day.
32359194,Increased mortality on the waiting list may become a collateral damage of this terrible pandemic.
32359210,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and rapidly spreading disease.
32359210,There are limited published data on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 infection among organ transplant recipients.
32359210,After initial flulike symptoms, progression to an inflammatory phase may occur, characterized by cytokine release rapidly leading to respiratory and multiorgan failure.
32359210,We report the clinical course and management of a liver transplant recipient on hemodialysis, who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, and despite completing a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, later developed marked inflammatory manifestations with rapid improvement after administration of off-label, single-dose tocilizumab.
32359210,We also highlight the role of lung ultrasonography in early diagnosis of the inflammatory phase of COVID-19.
32359210,Future investigation of the effects of immunomodulators among transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection will be important.
32359424,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was first reported in central China in December 2019.
32359424,Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA-positive cases from 1.6 million tests.
32359424,In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches.
32359424,Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic.
32359424,Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures.
32359424,Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased.
32359479,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency of international concern.
32359479,With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective.
32359479,Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32359479,Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission.
32359479,Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals.
32359479,We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.
32360053,In late 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in Wuhan, China.
32360053,A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever.
32360053,During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.
32360053,We examined the characteristics of these patients.
32360053,A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020.
32360053,Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history.
32360053,Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels.
32360053,Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment.
32360053,No patients had a fever (&gt;37.2°C).
32360053,One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery.
32360053,Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
32360053,Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases.
32360053,The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P &lt; .05).
32360053,The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%).
32360053,Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P &lt; .05).
32360053,Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally.
32360053,Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.
32360053,Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.
32360481,Since December 2019, new COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred and spread around the world.
32360481,However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear.
32360481,In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases.
32360481,We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020.
32360481,Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed.
32360481,Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases.
32360481,Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering.
32360481,The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %).
32360481,The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days.
32360481,Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis.
32360481,CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura.
32360481,Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases.
32360481,After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group.
32360481,Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes.
32360481,The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period.
32360481,The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low.
32360481,The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city.
32360481,According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate.
32360481,Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes.
32360481,No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition.
32360481,Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.
32360770,A pandemic of a novel Coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing devastating public health impact across the world.
32360770,In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public.
32360770,We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies.
32360770,Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by ℛ<sub>c</sub>), is less than unity.
32360770,Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively.
32360770,The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020.
32360770,The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32360770,This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented.
32360770,The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy ≥ 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks).
32360770,The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination).
32360770,Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic.
32360770,This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19.
32360770,Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19.
32360770,Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high.
32360770,The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.
32360907,At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China.
32360907,As of April 15, 2020, &gt;1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including &gt;120,000 deaths.
32360907,There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively.
32360907,Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis.
32360907,In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe.
32360907,The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website.
32360907,Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters.
32360907,ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively.
32360907,This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future.
32360907,The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions.
32360907,Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.
32360909,The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32360909,The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19.
32360909,In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32360909,In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future.
32360909,It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm.
32360909,This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy.
32360909,Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future.
32360909,Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32360909,Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future.
32360909,Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.
32361118,The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32361118,This new pathogen has spread rapidly around more than 200 countries, in which Spain has one of the world's highest mortality rates so far.
32361118,Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that weather conditions may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases.
32361118,However, some contradictory studies have also been reported in the same research line.
32361118,In addition, many of these studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors, which can limit the reliability of the results.
32361118,Herein, we report a spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Spain.
32361118,Non-meteorological factors such as population density, population by age, number of travellers and number of companies have also been considered for the analysis.
32361118,No evidence suggesting a reduction in COVID-19 cases at warmer mean, minimum and maximum temperatures has been found.
32361118,Nevertheless, these results need to be interpreted cautiously given the existing uncertainty about COVID-19 data, and should not be extrapolated to temperature ranges other than those analysed here for the early evolution period.
32361323,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world, and reports of children with COVID-19 are increasing.
32361323,To assess clinical profiles of pediatric COVID-19.
32361323,A retrospective analysis was undertaken using clinical data of sixteen children (11 months-14 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020 at Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei province, China.
32361323,All children had positive epidemiologic histories, 12 (12/16, 75 %) involving family units.
32361323,The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/or cough (8/16, 50 %).
32361323,Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities.
32361323,Leukocyte counts were normal in 14 cases(88 %), but 2 patients (12.5 %) had leukopenia, and 1 (6.3 %) was lymphopenic.
32361323,There were 11 patients with chest CT abnormalities, some nodular, others small patchy and others ground-glass opacities.
32361323,In asymptomatic children, the median time to SRAS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(NAT) positivity once exposed to a family member with confirmed infection was 15.5 days (range, 10-26 days).
32361323,The median time to first NAT-negative conversion was 5.5 days (range, 1-23 days).
32361323,COVID-19 in children of Xiangyang city is often family acquired and not serious, with favorable outcomes.
32361323,Asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest CT abnormalities.
32361323,It is essential to actively screen this segment of the population.
32361455,Clinical and epidemiological evidence has been advanced for human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus rampaging the world since late 2019.
32361455,Outliers in the human-to-human transmission are yet to be explored.
32361455,In this study, we examined the spatial density and leaned statistical credence to the global debate.
32361455,We constructed spatial variations of clusters that examined the nexus between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases.
32361455,We rely on publicly available data on confirmed cases and death across Africa to unravel the unobserved factors, that could be responsible for the spread of COVID-19.
32361455,We relied on the dynamic system generalised method of moment estimation procedure and found a ~0.045 Covid19 deaths as a result of confirmed cases in Africa.
32361455,We accounted for cross-sectional dependence and found a basis for the strict orthogonal relationship.
32361455,Policy measures were discussed.
32361535,The purpose of this case report is to describe the radiographic and clinical features of a COVID-19 pneumonia patient without clear epidemiological history outside Wuhan, China.
32362270,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 26 April 2020: notifications = 6,711; deaths = 77.
32362270,The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia.
32362270,Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
32362270,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case.
32362270,The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
32362270,The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%).
32362270,The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases.
32362270,High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission.
32362270,Internationally, cases continue to increase.
32362270,The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.
32362270,Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.
32362392,The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic remains unclear.
32362392,We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients from December 20, 2019, to February 25, 2020, in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes.
32362392,All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center retrospective study.
32362392,We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database.
32362392,We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men, and the average age was 51 years).
32362392,A total of 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan-related history of travel or contact.
32362392,Most took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds, and 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures.
32362392,Four upper airway infections were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the fourth recovered and was not tested).
32362392,All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment.
32362392,Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted.
32362392,Of these, 21.3% of recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia, and 87.2% of recipients had a therapeutic concentration of tacrolimus (5-12 ng/ml).
32362392,Liver and kidney insufficiency was seen in 5 and 6 recipients, respectively.
32362392,HTx recipients who practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to the associated disease COVID-19.
32362392,These early data will require confirmation as the pandemic establishes around the world.
32362424,On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2).
32362424,SARS-CoV-2 has presented rapid person-to-person transmission and is currently a global pandemic.
32362424,In the largest number of cases described to date of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease (2019-nCoViD), 26% required care in an intensive care unit (ICU).
32362424,This pandemic is causing an unprecedented mobilization of the scientific community, which has been associated with an exponentially growing number of publications in relation to it.
32362424,This narrative literature review aims to gather the main contributions in the area of intensive care to date in relation to the epidemiology, clinic, diagnosis and management of 2019-nCoViD.
32362969,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused infection in 168,000 cases worldwide in about 148 countries and killed more than 6,610 people around the world as of March 16, 2020, as per the World Health Organization (WHO).
32362969,Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, there is the rapid transmission, long incubation period, and disease containment is becoming extremely difficult.
32362969,The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers.
32362969,We also discussed various preventive measures to combat COVID-19 effectively.
32362969,A systematic and protocol-driven approach is needed to contain this disease, which was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the WHO.
32363205,We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features, and medical care-seeking process of patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, to provide useful information to contain COVID-19 in other places with similar outbreaks of the virus.
32363205,We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020.
32363205,The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed.
32363205,Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission.
32363205,It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later.
32363205,After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32363205,The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus.
32363205,Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks' isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.
32363221,Coronavirus infections have emerged as epidemic and pandemic threats in last two decades.
32363221,After the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, recently diagnosed novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread across 203 countries and territories in all 5 major continents.
32363221,World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.
32363221,Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e.
32363221,COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO.
32363221,As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT+2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO.
32363221,(Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83).
32363221,It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China.
32363221,A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals.
32363221,Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan.
32363221,They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2.
32363221,This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people.
32363221,Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults.
32363221,This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China.
32363221,The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts.
32363221,The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries.
32363221,Without any effective antiviral agents available at present, the need of the hour is early case detection, isolation of cases, use of good preventive care measures by the household contacts and in the hospital set up.
32363221,The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections.
32363221,A need for effective vaccine is being seen an as good preventive strategy in this pandemic.
32363221,However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.
32363226,This case is about a 9-year-old child diagnosed with COVID-19, with a history of epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids testing was positive, while chest CT examination was negative.
32363226,The clinical classification was light.
32363226,Nonetheless, isolation measures should still be taken to avoid infecting others.
32363228,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to progress since its discovery in December 2019.
32363228,A cluster of patients with atypical pneumonia identified in Wuhan, China, served as the epicenter of this recent epidemic.
32363228,This family of viruses is responsible for the common cold along with the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012.
32363228,The Southern China Wholesale Market reportedly has connections to the original 27 cases in Wuhan, China.
32363228,The worldwide confirmed case total has eclipsed 1,450,000, with more than 83,000 deaths.
32363228,Patient presentation ranges from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent death.
32363228,Early epidemiologic studies of viral spread support the hypothesis that COVID-19 can remain latent with an extended and infectious incubation period.
32363228,The U.S. government has issued level 3 precautions for most international travel, along with prohibiting entry to foreign nationals traveling from China, Iran, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the European Schengen area (e.g., France, Italy, Germany).
32363228,Prevention remains the mainstay in treating and defeating the COVID-19 epidemic.
32363228,Anyone infected or suspected of being infected should self-quarantine at home or admit themselves to a specified hospital with infrastructure to handle the situation.
32363228,The combination of prevention and containment provides the best opportunity to stall the spread of COVID-19.
32363492,Psychological health problems, especially emotional disorders, are common among adolescents.
32363492,The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events.
32363492,This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19.
32363492,We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12-18 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period.
32363492,An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment.
32363492,A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study.
32363492,An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively.
32363492,The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32363492,Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms.
32363492,In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms.
32363492,Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19.
32363492,These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.
32364890,Recent epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop).
32364890,SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious.
32364890,Critical knowledge gaps include the relative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the public health interventions that prevent asymptomatic transmission, and the question of whether asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protective immunity.
32365354,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic<sup>1</sup>.
32365354,The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective<sup>2</sup>, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings<sup>3</sup>.
32365354,Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data<sup>4,5</sup>, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China.
32365354,We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020.
32365354,Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying.
32365354,The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect.
32365354,The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April.
32365354,Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.
32366488,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected over 3300 health-care-workers (HCWs) in early 2020 in China.
32366488,Little information is known about nosocomial infections of HCWs in the initial period.
32366488,We analysed data from HCWs with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital and their family members.
32366488,We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines, and epidemiologic characteristics of 25 laboratory-confirmed and two highly suspected HCWs as well as ten of their family members with COVID-19 from Jan 5 to Feb 12, 2020.
32366488,Among them, demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed.
32366488,Nine clusters were found among the patients.
32366488,All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration.
32366488,The average periods of incubation, clinical onset serial interval (COSI), and virus shedding were 4.5 days, 5.2±3.2 days, and 18.5 days, respectively.
32366488,Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure with small, irrelevant mutations was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability.
32366488,SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted person-to-person regardless of whether they have symptoms in both hospital settings and social activities based on the short period of incubation and COSI.
32366488,The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close-contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas.
32366488,Besides, the HCWs should be alert during the epidemic, and make self-quarantine if self-suspected.
32366746,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and later the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32366746,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced that COVID-19 had reached global pandemic status.
32366746,This article summarized the understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention and control measures of COVID-19 based on the available data and anti-epidemic experience in China.
32367739,For the first time in history, on March 17, 2020, the European Union closed all its external borders in an attempt to contain the spreading of the coronavirus 2019, COVID-19.
32367739,Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic.
32367739,However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown.
32367739,Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe.
32367739,We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country.
32367739,Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak.
32367739,Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France.
32367739,Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.
32367793,To explore the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 associated with SARS-Cov-2 in Guizhou province, and to compare the differences in epidemiology with other provinces.
32367793,The data were extracted from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, Health Commission of Guizhou province, and Health Commission of Hubei province from January 20 to February 12, 2020.
32367793,Information included such as general demographic indicators, population data and clinical outcome.
32367793,A total of 135 cases were analyzed in the study.
32367793,The average age was 39.46±18.95 years.
32367793,The ratio of males to females was 0.985:1.
32367793,Most of COVID-19 patients were 18-45 years old (52.27%).
32367793,Close contact history was the most common (37.88%), followed by residence history in Hubei (34.85%).
32367793,There was no difference between males and females in age (P=0.953) and exposure condition (P=0.186).
32367793,Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007).
32367793,Among the cases, most patients were young adults.
32367793,Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females.
32367793,Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure.
32367793,Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.
32368252,The epidemiological emergency caused by CoV-2 (COVID-19) has changed priorities in breast cancer management.
32368252,In those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect, it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home, reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics, as well as avoiding surgeries.
32368252,In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries.
32368252,Accordingly, we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal-like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres, or even primary care.
32368570,The emerging infection of COVID-19 was initiated from Wuhan, China, have been spread to more than 210 countries around the globe including India.
32368570,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses.
32368570,The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World.
32368570,Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings.
32368570,Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality.
32368570,Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32368570,The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics.
32368570,Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered.
32368570,The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.
32368570,COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32368570,COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.
32368570,The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India.
32368792,As of April 9, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) had caused 89,931 deaths and 1,503,900 confirmed cases worldwide, which indicates an increasingly severe and uncontrollable situation.
32368792,Initially, little was known about the virus.
32368792,As research continues, we have learned the genome structure, epidemiological and clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2.
32368792,Based on these discoveries, identifying potential targets involved in the processes of virus pathogenesis is urgently needed, and discovering or developing promising drugs based on potential targets is the most pressing need.
32368792,Therefore, we summarize the potential therapeutic targets involved in virus pathogenesis and discuss the advancements, possibilities and significance of promising drugs based on these targets for treating SARS-CoV-2.
32368792,This review will facilitate the identification of potential targets and provide promising clues for drug development that can be translated into clinical applications for combating SARS-CoV-2.
32369190,Currently, the world is facinga global pandemicwith a new coronavirus SARS-CoV- 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus Type 2) causing infectious disease named COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019).
32369190,Comparing the clinical presentation and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 with previous coronavirus-associated respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV1 and MERS) revealedsome remarkable findings and differences.
32369190,Moreover, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed the complexity of COVID-19 profile with the variable clinical presentations.
32369222,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory disease occurred in Wuhan, China.
32369222,It is an emerging infectious disease with widespread and rapid infectiousness.
32369222,The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on 31 January 2020.
32369222,Severe COVID-19 patients should be managed and treated in a critical care unit.
32369222,Performing a chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease.
32369222,The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc.
32369222,The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition.
32369222,The management of COVID-19 should focus on early diagnosis, immediate isolation, general and optimized supportive care, and infection prevention and control.
32369475,The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus produces the disease called COVID-19, currently spreading in a rapidly evolving pandemic.
32369475,It can be transmitted by contact, drops and aerosols, and has been isolated from gastrointestinal secretions and faeces.
32369475,During digestive endoscopy, transmission by any of these mechanisms could occur.
32369475,It is recommended to limit digestive endoscopy to cases of digestive bleeding, severe dysphagia, foreign body in the digestive tract, biliary obstruction with intractable pain or cholangitis, pseudocyst or complicated encapsulated pancreatic necrosis, gastrointestinal obstruction, and cases at risk of deterioration over time.
32369475,It is recommended to screen patients based on temperature, symptoms, and epidemiological factors to classify them according to their risk of infection.
32369475,For procedures in low risk patients, personnel must wear a disposable gown, gloves, eye or face shield, standard surgical mask, disposable hat, disposable shoe covers.
32369475,In cases of intermediate or high risk, or confirmed COVID-19, protection should be increased using disposable waterproof gown, N95 respirator or similar, and double glove.
32369475,In case of shortage it may be necessary to reuse N95 respirators for up to 5 uses, following CDC recommendations for donning, removing and storing to prevent secondary contact contamination.
32369475,Likewise, all protective equipment should be put on and removed according to CDC recommendations.
32369475,The presence of personnel in endoscopy should be limited to the bare minimum.
32369475,Said personnel must have daily temperature control and if it is above 37.3ºC, the corresponding evaluation must be carried out.
32369475,After each procedure, the stretcher and room surfaces should be properly disinfected.
32369475,High-level disinfection of endoscopes eliminates SARS-CoV-2.
32369865,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered several hypotheses regarding use of specific medicines and risk of infection as well as prognosis.
32369865,Under these unique circumstances, rapid answers require quick engagement in data collection and analyses; however, appropriate design and conduct of pharmacoepidemiologic studies are needed to generate valid and reliable evidence.
32369865,In this paper, endorsed by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology, we provide methodological considerations for the conduct of pharmacoepidemiological studies in relation to the pandemic across eight domains: (1) timeliness of evidence, including the need to prioritise some questions over others in the acute phase of the pandemic; (2) the need to align observational and interventional research on efficacy; (3) the specific challenges related to &quot;real-time epidemiology&quot; during an ongoing pandemic; (4) what design to use to answer a specific question; (5) considerations on the definition of exposures; (6) what covariates to collect; (7) considerations on the definition of outcomes; and (8) the need for transparent reporting.
32370116,The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has called for unprecedented measures, to the extent that the Italian government has imposed a quarantine on the entire country.
32370116,Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain.
32370116,The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population.
32370116,An online survey was administered from 18-22 March 2020 to 2766 participants.
32370116,Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress.
32370116,Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.
32370116,Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.
32370116,Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively.
32370116,This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.
32371066,More airborne-infection isolation rooms are needed in centers that treat severely affected coronavirus 2019 patients.
32371066,Wards and rooms must be carefully checked to ensure an ample supply of medical air and oxygen.
32371066,Anterooms adjacent to airborne-infection isolation rooms are required to maintain pressure differentials and provide an area for donning/doffing or disinfecting medical equipment.
32371231,With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic.
32371231,We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE.
32371231,Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world.
32371231,Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables.
32371231,WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it.
32371231,Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted.
32371231,For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance.
32371231,Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations.
32371231,Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases.
32371231,Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots.
32371231,Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.
32371477,The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic (COVID-19) presents challenges to the robust collection of population-scale data to address this global health crisis.
32371477,We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to bring together scientists with expertise in big data research and epidemiology to develop a COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile application that we launched in the UK on March 24, 2020 and the US on March 29, 2020 garnering more than 2.8 million users as of May 2, 2020.
32371477,This mobile application offers data on risk factors, herald symptoms, clinical outcomes, and geographical hot spots.
32371477,This initiative offers critical proof-of-concept for the repurposing of existing approaches to enable rapidly scalable epidemiologic data collection and analysis which is critical for a data-driven response to this public health challenge.
32371551,The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) pandemic presents challenges to the real-time collection of population-scale data to inform near-term public health needs as well as future investigations.
32371551,We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community.
32371551,As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants.
32371551,This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden.
32371551,Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hotspots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors.
32371551,The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.
32371551,We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health.
32372664,In April 2009, Mexican, American, and Canadian authorities announced a novel influenza that became the first pandemic of the century.
32372664,We report on lessons learned in Mexico.
32372664,The Mexican Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan, developed and implemented since 2005, was a decisive element for the early response.
32372664,Major lessons-learned were the need for flexible plans that consider different scenarios; the need to continuously strengthen routine surveillance programs and laboratory capacity and strengthen coordination between epidemiological departments, clinicians, and laboratories; maintain strategic stockpiles; establish a fund for public health emergencies; and collaboration among neighboring countries.
32372664,Mexico responded with immediate reporting and transparency, implemented aggressive control measures and generous sharing of data and samples.
32372664,Lessons learned induced changes leading to a better response to public health critical events.
32373998,Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has rapidly spread all over the world, in just two months.
32373998,As of 27 March, globally, 509,164 cases confirmed included 23,335 deaths in approximately 150 countries.
32373998,Recently, WHO has defined COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and considerable researches have focused on the identification and prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
32373998,As a result, accumulated publications successively reported their early findings, leading to the constant updating of information, which might make confusion for readers.
32373998,Therefore, this review summarized the current researches about the genomic evolution, variation of SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrated its viral structure for pathogenesis.
32373998,Meanwhile, we analyzed the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide recommendations for present clinical treatments and inspirations for potential therapy options.
32374000,The last two decades have witnessed two large-scale pandemics caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32374000,At the end of 2019, another novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hit Wuhan, a city in the center of China, and subsequently spread rapidly to the whole world.
32374000,Latest reports revealed that more than 800 thousand people in over 200 countries are involved in the epidemic disease by SARS-CoV-2.
32374000,Due to the high mortality rate and the lack of optimum therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the biological characteristics of the virus and its possible pathogenesis to respond to the SARS-CoV-2.
32374000,Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control.
32374000,However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics.
32374000,Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development.
32374000,In this review, we focus on our current understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapeutics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32374541,Based on the epidemiological data currently available, diabetes does not seem to be a risk factor for infection with SARS-CoV-2 but may be associated with a more severe course.
32374541,Diabetes is extremely common in older patients with co-morbidities who are at risk of unfavorable outcomes.
32374541,As with any other infection, poorly controlled pre-existing diabetes can promote secondary infections and lead to acute complications related to hyperglycemia, worsened itself by the infection.
32374541,It is important to advise patients to have enough diabetic equipment and supplies at home, to make regular blood glucose self-tests, and to contact a caregiver immediately in case of glycemic imbalance or signs of infection.
32374541,Antidiabetic therapy may need adjustments following usual sick day rules.
32374541,Insulin therapy should be considered to treat any persistent hyperglycemia in patients hospitalized for an acute infection.
32374541,D’après les données épidémiologiques actuellement disponibles, le diabète ne semble pas être un facteur de risque d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2.
32374541,Il est cependant associé à une maladie plus sévère principalement en raison de sa haute prévalence chez les personnes âgées et polymorbides dont l’évolution est plus souvent défavorable.
32374541,Comme lors de n’importe quelle autre infection, un diabète préexistant, surtout s’il est mal contrôlé, peut favoriser les surinfections et entraîner des complications aiguës liées à l’hyperglycémie, elle-même majorée par l’infection.
32374541,Il est important de recommander aux patients d’avoir suffisamment de matériel à domicile, d’effectuer des automesures régulières de la glycémie, ainsi que de contacter un soignant immédiatement en cas de déséquilibre glycémique ou d’infection.
32374541,Le traitement antidiabétique doit être adapté comme habituellement en cas d’infection.
32374541,Une insulinothérapie doit être envisagée en cas d’hyperglycémie persistante chez tout patient hospitalisé pour une infection aiguë.
32374544,Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak, growing evidence suggests that patients suffering from COVID-19 are at increased risk of thrombotic events.
32374544,The sepsis-related activation of the coagulation combined with a high prevalence of common thrombotic risk factors could contribute to this prothrombotic state.
32374544,Coagulation biomarkers could help in the identification of patients at risk of complications and mortality.
32374544,The incidence of venous thromboembolic events appears to be increased, especially in severe COVID-19 patients.
32374544,Based on that knowledge, several societies have provided recommendation on the prevention of venous thromboembolism.
32374544,In this narrative review, we summarize available epidemiologic data on venous thromboembolism and recommendations on thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19.
32374544,Depuis le début de l’épidémie de SARS-CoV-2, des faisceaux d’évidences suggèrent que les patients souffrant de COVID-19 sont à risque augmenté d’événements thrombotiques.
32374544,L’activation de la coagulation secondaire au sepsis associée à des facteurs de risques thrombotiques classiques pourrait contribuer à cet état prothrombotique.
32374544,Les marqueurs de la coagulation semblent stratifier le risque de détérioration clinique et de mortalité.
32374544,Le risque de la maladie thromboembolique veineuse (MTEV) semble très élevé, notamment chez les patients sévèrement atteints.
32374544,Dans ce contexte, de nombreuses sociétés savantes ont émis des recommandations pour la prévention de la MTEV.
32374544,Nous proposons une mise à jour des connaissances actuelles sur les données épidémiologiques disponibles et sur les recommandations pour la prévention de la MTEV dans le COVID-19.
32374903,The COVID pandemic is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32374903,The major mutation detected to date in the SARS-CoV-2 viral envelope spike protein, which is responsible for virus attachment to the host and is also the main target for host antibodies, is a mutation of an aspartate (D) at position 614 found frequently in Chinese strains to a glycine (G).
32374903,We sought to infer health impact of this mutation.
32374903,Increased case fatality rate correlated strongly with the proportion of viruses bearing G614 on a country by country basis.
32374903,The amino acid at position 614 occurs at an internal protein interface of the viral spike, and the presence of G at this position was calculated to destabilize a specific conformation of the viral spike, within which the key host receptor binding site is more accessible.
32374903,These results imply that G614 is a more pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2, which may influence vaccine design.
32374903,The prevalence of this form of the virus should also be included in epidemiologic models predicting the COVID-19 health burden and fatality over time in specific regions.
32374903,Physicians should be aware of this characteristic of the virus to anticipate the clinical course of infection.
32375234,(1) Background: The virulence of coronavirus diseases due to viruses like SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV decreases in humid and hot weather.
32375234,The putative temperature dependence of infectivity by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 or covid-19 has a high predictive medical interest.
32375234,(2) Methods: External temperature and new covid-19 cases in 21 countries and in the French administrative regions were collected from public data.
32375234,Associations between epidemiological parameters of the new case dynamics and temperature were examined using an ARIMA model.
32375234,(3) Results: We show that, in the first stages of the epidemic, the velocity of contagion decreases with country- or region-wise temperature.
32375234,(4) Conclusions: Results indicate that high temperatures diminish initial contagion rates, but seasonal temperature effects at later stages of the epidemy remain questionable.
32375234,Confinement policies and other eviction rules should account for climatological heterogeneities, in order to adapt the public health decisions to possible geographic or seasonal gradients.
32375776,To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK.
32375776,We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>, the average number of secondary cases generated per case).
32375776,We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day.
32375776,The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not).
32375776,In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures.
32375776,The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a &quot;lockdown&quot; was implemented across the UK.
32375776,We compared measured contact patterns during the &quot;lockdown&quot; to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period.
32375776,By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed.
32375776,We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place.
32375776,We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8).
32375776,This would be sufficient to reduce R<sub>0</sub> from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only.
32375776,The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks.
32375776,However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported.
32375776,Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.
32375909,In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appeared in Wuhan, China.
32375909,Serious outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, have occurred throughout China and the world.
32375909,Therefore, we intend to shed light on its potential clinical and epidemiological characteristics.
32375909,In this retrospective study, we included 50 confirmed fatal cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported on Chinese official media networks from January 16, 2020, to February 5, 2020.
32375909,All the cases were confirmed by local qualified medical and health institutions.
32375909,Specific information has been released through official channels.
32375909,According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the gender, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases, and other data of the patients, and carried out analyses and discussion.
32375909,In total, 50 fatal cases were reported: median age was 70 y old, and males were 2.33 times more likely to die than females.
32375909,The median number of days from the first symptom to death was 13, and that length of time tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and older compared with those younger than 65 (12 days vs 17 days; P = 0.046).
32375909,Therefore, the older patients had fewer number of days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40; P = 0.012).
32375909,In our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progression to death time was shorter.
32375909,At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.
32376543,To explore the value of the &quot;dandelion clock-like&quot; sign on chest CT for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.
32376543,This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020.
32376543,The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded.
32376543,Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia.
32376543,We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia.
32376543,Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms.
32376543,Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like &quot;crazy-paving&quot; patterns.
32376543,The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a &quot;dandelion clek-like&quot; sign and 37 with a &quot;dandelion seed sign&quot;.
32376543,These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.
32376543,The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.
32376587,In the setting of epidemics of communicable diseases, early initiation of epidemiological and clinical data collection and analysis and conducting relevant researches are essential to the success of epidemic containment.
32376587,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), starting initially as an epidemic in China in late 2019 and now becoming a pandemic globally, poses grave challenges to the global health care systems while also provides an opportunity for studying infectious diseases in the perspective of methodology.
32376587,The authors propose the evaluation methods for case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence studies and health economics researches during an epidemic.
32376587,Case reports, which are of important value for health care workers during outbreaks of infectious diseases, should be written in standard format and style and published following a strict peer review process.
32376587,RCTs provides the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a given treatment for the patients from the outbreaks.
32376587,We review the potential challenges faced in conducting RCTs during the outbreaks.
32376587,The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures.
32376587,The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies.
32376587,Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks.
32376587,We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.
32377559,An epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and rapidly spread across China and beyond, with human to human transmission.
32377559,On February 12, 2020, World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
32377559,Most COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using Chinese medicines and other secondary therapies.
32377559,As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered.
32377559,Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate.
32377559,An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.
32377559,This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32378503,On December 31, 2019, the Chinese government officially announced that the country had a single pneumonia case with an unknown cause.
32378503,In the weeks after, South Korea had 24 confirmed cases by February 8, and the number has increased steadily since then.
32378503,The highly contagious virus known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected Case No. 31 in Daegu; she was the first patient related to Sincheonji Church.
32378503,Later, the number of cases involved with Sincheonji skyrocketed.
32378503,On March 6, 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 6284, with 42 dead.
32378503,This study, through collecting epidemiological data about various COVID-19 infection cases, discovered that getting together in large groups leads to mass infection, and that paying close attention to personal hygiene by means of wearing masks, sanitary gloves, etc., can prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32378503,Additional epidemiological data and related studies on COVID-19 infections in South Korea are likely to support or slightly modify this conclusion.
32378503,However, this study is significant in that it emphasizes the precautionary principle in preventing and managing infectious diseases, and has a suggestion for public health policies, which are currently in high demand.
32378815,In February 2020, the World Health Organisation designated the name COVID-19 for a clinical condition caused by a virus identified as a cause for a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.
32378815,The virus subsequently spread worldwide, causing havoc to medical systems and paralyzing global economies.
32378815,The first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed on 27 February 2020.
32378815,To present our findings and experiences as the first and largest center for COVID-19 patients in Israel.
32378815,The current analysis included all COVID-19 patients treated in Sheba Medical Center from February 2020 to April 2020.
32378815,Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented.
32378815,Our 162 patient cohort included mostly adult (mean age of 52 ± 20 years) males (65%).
32378815,Patients classified as severe COVID-19 were significantly older and had higher prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes.
32378815,They also had significantly higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and lactate dehydrogenase.
32378815,Low folic acid blood levels were more common amongst severe patients (18.2 vs.
32378815,12.9 vs.
32378815,9.8, P = 0.014).
32378815,The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population.
32378815,The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated.
32378815,The mortality rate was 3.1.
32378815,COVID-19 patients present a challenge for healthcare professionals and the whole medical system.
32378815,We hope our findings will assist other providers and institutions in their care for these patients.
32379056,During the epidemic of COVID-19, the management model of colorectal cancer has to be changed at our center due to relatively limited medical resources.
32379056,Outpatient visits are reduced under well protected after appointment, and rigorous investigation of epidemiological history and clinical symptoms are needed.
32379056,We prefer a simple and convenient treatment regimen, which may also be postponed appropriately.
32379056,Minimally invasive CRC surgery combined with a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery should be recommended.
32379056,We also focus on mental health treatments and healthy lifestyle education.
32379056,In addition, routine follow-up can be moderately delayed.
32379056,In total, adequate doctor-patient communication is also recommended throughout the treatment.
32379077,As a result of the 2019 novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) global spread, medical examiner/coroner offices will inevitably encounter increased numbers of COVID-19-infected decedents at autopsy.
32379077,While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (e.g. cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms.
32379077,Those dying with-but not of-COVID-19 may still be infectious, however.
32379077,While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations.
32379077,Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there are a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings.
32379077,A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations.
32379077,We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.
32379114,Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population.
32379114,The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures.
32379114,Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020.
32379114,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32379114,All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture.
32379114,The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each).
32379114,Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient).
32379114,Lymphopenia (&lt;1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein.
32379114,Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status.
32379114,Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission.
32379114,The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.
32379114,The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32379114,This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32379114,Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.
32379114,Prognostic Level IV.
32379114,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32379199,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a global threat.
32379199,However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported.
32379199,Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded.
32379199,The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
32379199,The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days.
32379199,The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease.
32379199,Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment.
32379199,The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection.
32379199,The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.
32379199,CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children.
32379199,The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.
32379199,The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.
32379502,Knowing the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections is essential for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
32379502,Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity.
32379502,The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%).
32379502,County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%.
32379502,The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms.
32379502,When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic.
32379502,The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available.
32379502,Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies. [<i>Editor's Note: This Fast Track Ahead Of Print article is the accepted version of the peer-reviewed manuscript.
32379502,The final edited version will appear in an upcoming issue of</i> Health Affairs.].
32379707,Current studies estimated a general incubation period distribution of COVID-19 based on early-confirmed cases in Wuhan, and have not examined whether the incubation period distribution varies across population segments with different travel histories.
32379707,We aimed to examine whether patients infected by community transmission had extended incubation periods than the early generation patients who had direct exposures to Wuhan.
32379707,Based on 4741 patient case reports from municipal centers of disease control by February 21, 2020, we calculated the incubation periods of 2555 patients with clear epidemiological survey information and illness development timeline.
32379707,All patients were categorized into five groups by their travel histories.
32379707,Incubation period distributions were modeled for each group by the method of the posterior Weibull distribution estimation.
32379707,Adults aged 30 to 59 years had the most substantial proportion of confirmed cases in China.
32379707,The incubation period distribution varied slightly across patient groups with different travel histories.
32379707,Patients who regularly lived in Wuhan and left to other locations before January 23, 2020 had the shortest posterior median value of 7.57 days for the incubation period, while the incubation periods for persons affected by local community transmission had the largest posterior median of incubation periods, 9.31 days.
32379707,The median incubation period for all patients infected outside Wuhan was 9 days, a bit of more extended than the early estimated 5-day incubation period that was based on patients in Wuhan.
32379707,Our findings may imply the decreases of virulence of the COVID-19 virus along with intergenerational transmission.
32379726,BACKGROUND The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
32379726,This paper presents an epidemiological analysis of the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland.
32379726,MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out between 3 and 27 March 2020 on a sample of 1389 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Poland.
32379726,Data were obtained from epidemiological reports collected by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate.
32379726,Analysis includes the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, number of people quarantined, and number of laboratory tests performed.
32379726,RESULTS The first case was confirmed on 4 March 2020.
32379726,Over 24 days after the first case, the total number of confirmed infections rose to 1389 (34,000 laboratory tests were performed).
32379726,The highest incidence rates (over 5 per 100,000) were observed in the 2 central administrative regions (Mazowieckie and Łódzkie) and in the south-western region of Dolnośląskie, which borders the Czech Republic and Germany.
32379726,Based on available data about age and sex, a clearly higher incidence was observed in the 20-29 years (4.0 per 100,000), 40-49 years (4.1 per 100,000), and 50-59 years (4.3 per 100,000) age groups.
32379726,In the period analyzed (24 days), there were 16 confirmed deaths (average age 65.5 years; 81.2% males).
32379726,CONCLUSIONS The proportion of women and men with confirmed COVID-19 infection was similar to the sex ratio in the general population.
32379726,Infections were relatively less common in those aged under 20 years.
32379726,The largest numbers of confirmed cases were detected in 3 of the 4 largest cities, each of which has an international airport.
32379727,Respiratory pathogens, such as novel influenza A viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and now, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are of particular concern because of their high transmissibility and history of global spread (1).
32379727,Clusters of severe respiratory disease are challenging to investigate, especially in resource-limited settings, and disease etiology often is not well understood.
32379727,In 2014, endorsed by the Group of Seven (G7),* the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was established to help build country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.<sup>†</sup> GHSA is a multinational, multisectoral collaboration to support countries towards full implementation of the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR).<sup>§</sup> Initially, 11 technical areas for collaborator participation were identified to meet GHSA goals.
32379727,CDC developed the Detection and Response to Respiratory Events (DaRRE) strategy in 2014 to enhance country capacity to identify and control respiratory disease outbreaks.
32379727,DaRRE initiatives support the four of 11 GHSA technical areas that CDC focuses on: surveillance, laboratory capacity, emergency operations, and workforce development.<sup>¶</sup> In 2016, Kenya was selected to pilot DaRRE because of its existing respiratory disease surveillance and laboratory platforms and well-developed Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) (2).
32379727,During 2016-2020, Kenya's DaRRE partners (CDC, the Kenya Ministry of Health [MoH], and Kenya's county public health officials) conceptualized, planned, and implemented key components of DaRRE.
32379727,Activities were selected based on existing capacity and determined by the Kenya MoH and included 1) expansion of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance sites; 2) piloting of community event-based surveillance; 3) expansion of laboratory diagnostic capacity; 4) training of public health practitioners in detection, investigation, and response to respiratory threats; and 5) improvement of response capacity by the national emergency operations center (EOC).
32379727,Progress on DaRRE activity implementation was assessed throughout the process.
32379727,This pilot in Kenya demonstrated that DaRRE can support IHR requirements and can capitalize on a country's existing resources by tailoring tools to improve public health preparedness based on countries' needs.
32382154,The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 2020<sup>1-4</sup>.
32382154,Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies<sup>5</sup>.
32382154,Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term.
32382154,We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests<sup>6,7</sup> to identify and deploy recovered individuals<sup>8</sup> as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale.
32382154,The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services<sup>9</sup> while reducing the probability of transmission.
32382154,Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.
32382154,The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence<sup>10,11</sup> and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies<sup>12-15</sup>.
32382743,The United States' COVID-19 epidemic has grown extensively since February 2020, with substantial associated hospitalizations and mortality; New York State (NYS) has emerged as the national epicenter.
32382743,We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations.
32382743,Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams.
32382743,Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively.
32382743,Active testing of initial case's households enabled estimation of household prevalence.
32382743,During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties.
32382743,Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died.
32382743,Testing conducted among 498 members of these case's households found prevalent infection among 57%; excluding first-reported cases 38%.
32382743,In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among those &lt;5 years to 68% among those ≥65 years (p&lt;.0001).
32382743,New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020.
32382743,The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.
32382748,The current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reveals a peculiar trend of milder disease and lower case fatality in children compared to adults.
32382748,Consistent epidemiologic evidence of reduced severity of infection in children across different populations and countries suggests there are underlying biologic differences between children and adults that mediate differential disease pathogenesis.
32382748,This presents a unique opportunity to learn about disease modifying host factors from pediatric populations.
32382748,Our review summarizes the current knowledge of pediatric clinical disease, role in transmission, risks for severe disease, protective immunity, as well as novel therapies and vaccine trials for children.
32382748,We then define key hypotheses and areas for future research that can use the pediatric model of disease, transmission, and immunity to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for people of all age groups.
32383254,The micro-neutralization assay is a fundamental test in virology, immunology, vaccine assessment, and epidemiology studies.
32383254,Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of December 2019 in China, it has become extremely important to have well-established and validated diagnostic and serological assays for this new emerging virus.
32383254,Here, we present a micro-neutralization assay with the use of SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus with two different methods of read-out.
32383254,We evaluated the performance of this assay using human serum samples taken from an Italian seroepidemiological study being performed at the University of Siena, along with the human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and some iper-immune animal serum samples against Influenza and Adenovirus strains.
32383254,The same panel of human samples have been previously tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a pre-screening.
32383254,Positive, borderline, and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different methods of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer).
32383254,Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner.
32383254,Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.
32383432,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has unveiled underlying health inequities throughout the United States.
32383432,The pandemic has spread across U.S. states, affecting different vulnerable populations, including both inner-city and rural populations, and those living in congregate settings such as nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.
32383432,In addition, since early April, there has been an increasing number of outbreaks of COVID-19 in jails and prisons.
32383432,We describe three overlapping epidemiologic waves of spread of COVID-19 linked to three different kinds of structural vulnerabilities.
32385130,Reports indicate that those most vulnerable to developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are older adults and those with underlying illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, which are common comorbidities among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.
32385130,However, there is limited information about the clinical characteristics of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 or about interventions to control COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers.
32385130,We collected data retrospectively through an online registration system that includes all patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 65 centers in Wuhan, China.
32385130,We reviewed epidemiologic and clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 10, 2020.
32385130,Of 7154 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 154 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
32385130,The mean age of the 131 patients in our analysis was 63.2 years; 57.3% were men.
32385130,Many had underlying comorbidities, with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension) being the most common (68.7%).
32385130,Only 51.9% of patients manifested fever; 21.4% of infected patients were asymptomatic.
32385130,The most common finding on chest computed tomography (CT) was ground-grass or patchy opacity (82.1%).
32385130,After initiating comprehensive interventions-including entrance screening of body temperature and symptoms, universal chest CT and blood tests, and other measures-new patients presenting with COVID-19 peaked at 10 per day on January 30, decreasing to 4 per day on February 11.
32385130,No new cases occurred between February 26 and March 10, 2020.
32385130,We found that patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were susceptible to COVID-19 and that hemodialysis centers were high-risk settings during the epidemic.
32385130,Increasing prevention efforts, instituting universal screening, and isolating patients with COVID-19 and directing them to designated hemodialysis centers were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers.
32385990,To discuss the research progress in the field of coronavirus (CoVs) treatment based on the visualization analysis of knowledge graph.
32385990,The related literatures in the field of CoVs treatment were retrieved from the establishment of Web of Science core collection database to February 15th, 2020, and the literature analysis tool of Web of Science database was used to count the annual trend of published literatures.

32385990,In terms of literature authors, there were two high-yielding authors in the United States [Ralph S.
32385990,Baric (n = 21) and Kuochen Chou (n = 17)], two Chinese authors [Yuen Kwok-yung (n = 17) and Jiang Shibo (n = 16)] and one Dutch author [Eric J.
32385990,Snijder (n = 17)].
32385990,In terms of the cluster analysis of authors, the authors were closely related in reverse genetics, respiratory infection, receptor binding domain, etc., and the 15 top-cited papers came mainly from China, the United States, Netherlands and other countries, and the literature content represented the frontiers and hot spots in different periods.
32385990,The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation.
32385990,The main subject words were divided into three main categories, namely, CoVs epidemiology, basic research and drug development, in which basic research and drug development were strongly correlated.
32385990,In the subject words breakthrough analysis, there were time-related breakthrough points in 1991, 1996 and 2002, and the &quot;diagnosis&quot; and &quot;sequence&quot; were continuous hot spots.
32385990,Through the visualization analysis of knowledge graph, the development trend and hot spots of CoVs therapy research could be well observed.
32385990,In this study, the degree of attention in the field of CoVs treatment showed periodic changes, related to the outbreak of new CoVs, and the country, institutions and the author were closely related.
32385990,The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation in order to develop new targets of drug.
32386011,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a huge threat to global public health because it develops rapidly.
32386011,There is no specific treatment so far.
32386011,Chest imaging examination is an important auxiliary examination method in diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386011,To further standardize the imaging examination and diagnosis of COVID-19, Hunan Society of Radiology together with Imaging Technology Professional Committee of Hunan Medical Association reach an expert consensus document on imaging examination, diagnosis, and control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19.
32386011,This document summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging examination procedure, imaging findings, CT staging, the value of imaging examination, and the methods for control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19 during imaging examination.
32386011,Furthermore, it extends the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in children.
32386011,自新型冠状病毒疫情暴发以来，该病毒传播迅速、传染性强且尚无特异性治疗方法，对全球公共卫生形成了巨大威胁。
32386011,胸部影像学检查是新型冠状病毒肺炎(coronavirus disease 2019，COVID-19)诊疗过程中的重要诊断方法。
32386011,为进一步规范COVID-19的影像学检查与诊断工作，湖南省医学会放射学专业委员会和湖南省医学会影像技术专业委员会联合制定了湖南省COVID-19影像学检查、诊断及医院内感染预防与控制专家共识。
32386011,本共识阐述了COVID-19的流行病学特征、临床特征、影像学检查流程、影像学表现和CT分期、影像学检查的价值，以及影像学检查医院内感染预防与控制方法，同时总结了儿童COVID-19的临床特点和影像学表现。.
32386017,To investigate imaging features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to provide concrete evidences for diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386017,Imaging data of the first chest CT examination and clinical data (age, sex, clinical history, epidemiological history, and laboratory tests) of 163 patients with COVID-19 from 2 hospitals were collected for retrospective analysis.
32386017,Imaging features of the first chest CT examination and the correspondence between CT manifestations and the nucleic acid test results of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed.
32386017,The first chest CT images of 163 COVID-19 patients showed that 92.02% of lesions were ground-glass opacity (GGO), 76.69% were consolidation, and 73.62% were GGO together with consolidation.
32386017,Multiple lesions were found in 71.17% patients and multiple lobules in 86.50% patients.

32386027,The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has posed significant threats to international health.
32386027,By Feb. 20, 2020, 74 576 cases have been confirmed and over 2 118 deaths have reported in the Chinese mainland.
32386027,Chinese administrations have carried out immediate and prompt measures to stop the spread of the virus.
32386027,Wuhan city has been shut down since Jan. 23, and more than 30 thousand medical workers have been recruited to Hubei province.
32386027,Two temporary hospitals were constructed to treat severe pneumonia patients, and 15 mobile cabin hospitals were built to treat mild pneumonia cases.
32386027,Significant improvement regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and diagnosis and therapy for the COVID-19 has been achieved to stop the spread of the epidemics.
32386027,2019年12月下旬在中国武汉暴发的2019冠状病毒病给中国人民，乃至全球人类的健康带来严重威胁。
32386027,目前感染病例数仍在不断上升，截至2020年2月20日，确诊病例已经达到74 576人，死亡病例达到2 118人。
32386027,面对这一严重疫情，中国采取了史无前例的举措来控制疾病流行，如对武汉采取“封城”措施，调派全国多支医疗队，超过3万余名医务工作者支援湖北，临时建立两家医院治疗重症患者，建设15家方舱医院收治轻症患者。
32386027,在病原体鉴定、流行病学、临床诊疗等多个领域进行研究，取得显著成绩，有效控制了疫情蔓延。.
32386675,We did a comprehensive exploration of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing which was adjacent to the west of Hubei province.
32386675,This study was conducted on 136 patients with COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing from Jan 25 to Feb 20, 2020.
32386675,Data of patients included demographic, epidemiological, clinical features, chest radiographs of imported cases, local cases, second-generation cases and third-generation cases.
32386675,Student's t-test was adopted for quantitative variables while Pearson Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.
32386675,The median age was 47 years and common symptoms of illness were cough (50.7%), fever (47.1%) and fatigue (14.0%).
32386675,The time from contact symptomatic case to illness was 7.7 days, and 88 patients (64.7%) were cluster cases, radiological evidence found bilateral lung involvement was common (57.4%).
32386675,Compared with the imported cases, the local cases were significantly older, the proportion of men is lower.
32386675,There was higher proportion of cluster cases in local cases.
32386675,Unlike imported cases, which fever was the dominant symptom, the local cases have more cough patients, with a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients.
32386675,The third-generation cases have a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients.
32386675,We concluded the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases andsuggested to take more comprehensive measures for screening patients, especially for elderly person, avoid family gatherings, and implement more closely surveillance of suspect patients and their close contacts.
32387470,The severe form of COVID-19 share several clinical and laboratory features with four entities gathered under the term &quot;hyperferritinemic syndromes&quot; and including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS) and septic shock.
32387470,COVID-19 systemic inflammatory reaction and &quot;hyperferritinemic syndromes&quot; are all characterized by high serum ferritin and a life-threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure.
32387470,In this review, we analyze the possible epidemiological and molecular mechanisms responsible for hyper-inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and we underline the similarities between this condition and &quot;hyperferritinemic syndromes&quot; which would allow considering severe COVID-19 as a fifth member of this spectrum of inflammatory conditions.
32387778,Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool.
32387778,Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE).
32387778,In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
32387778,The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation.
32387778,Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations.
32387778,This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities.
32387778,The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.
32388390,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
32388390,Since December 2019, the world has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32388390,Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but the factors affecting the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well described.
32388390,In this article, we provide a novel hypothesis to describe how an increase in cellular adenosine triphosphate (c-ATP) can potentially improve the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems to either prevent or fight off COVID-19.
32388472,In December 2019, coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32388472,The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions.
32388472,To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020.
32388472,From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
32388472,There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years.
32388472,Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak.
32388472,Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province.
32388472,These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)].
32388472,Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)].
32388472,The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection.
32388472,Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly.
32388472,Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients.
32388472,CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %).
32388472,Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea.
32388472,Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients.
32388472,And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32388472,The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area.
32388472,For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results.
32388472,Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32388472,Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.
32388947,The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed.
32388947,The first patient A developed on January 22, 2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28; patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and was diagnosed on January 31.
32388947,In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early.
32388947,Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32388947,Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative.
32388947,In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic.
32388947,Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.
32388947,分析甘肃省首起新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）家族聚集性疫情中7例COVID-19患者及1例密切接触者的流行病学史及临床特征。
32388947,首例患者A于2020年1月22日发病，有武汉居留史，1月24日确诊COVID-19重症病例；患者B，2020年1月23日发病，1月31日确诊，重症病例；患者C无症状，1月27日确诊；患者D无症状，1月27日确诊；患者E，1月24日发病，1月28日确诊；患者F无症状，1月31日确诊；患者G无症状，1月31日确诊；密切接触者H无症状，PCR连续检测阴性，无症状，提前出院。
32388947,7例患者中，1例（B）加重死亡，其他患者经过积极救治，病情均得到有效控制。
32388947,除了出院病例外，有5例COVID-19特异IgM抗体检测阳性，1例检测阴性。
32388947,此次聚集性暴发，4例患者始终无症状，但PCR和IgM抗体检测阳性，说明无症状者可能是此次控制疫情的关键节点，对于咽拭子核酸检测阴性但明确有毛玻璃样肺部病变的患者进行特异性IgM抗体筛查对病例早发现早隔离至关重要。.
32389518,The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population.
32389518,Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable.
32389518,We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology.
32389518,The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020.
32389518,It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes.
32389518,It is an online registry.
32389518,Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient.
32389518,As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities.
32389518,The most represented form of RRT is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients.
32389518,Symptoms are similar to the general population.
32389518,A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units.
32389518,The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids.
32389518,Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids.
32389518,Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death.
32389518,SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.
32389846,To estimate the ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
32389846,We analyzed the epidemiological dataset of confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Japan as of 28 February 2020.
32389846,A statistical model was constructed to describe the heterogeneity of reporting rate by age and severity.
32389846,We estimated the number of severe and non-severe cases, accounting for under-ascertainment.
32389846,The ascertainment rate of non-severe cases was estimated at 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.37, 0.50), indicating that unbiased number of non-cases would be more than twice the reported count.
32389846,Severe cases are twice more likely diagnosed and reported than other cases.
32389846,Considering that reported cases are usually dominated by non-severe cases, the adjusted total number of cases is also about a double of observed count.
32389846,Our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data, and it is advised to interpret mild case data of COVID-19 as always under-ascertained.
32389849,Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were firstly appeared in China.
32389849,They have certain similarities in biological, epidemiological and pathological.
32389849,To data, the researches have shown that their gene exhibit 79% of identical sequence and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar.
32389849,There have been extensive research performed on SARS, however, the understanding of pathophysiology impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) is still limited.
32389849,In the review, we draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis for further understand the features of COVID-19.
32389849,By comparing these two diseases, we found, COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, higher morbidity and mortality.
32389849,Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases were emerged in COVID-19.
32389849,Children started with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe condition and newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications.
32389849,The laboratory test data showed, the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, otherwise the number of CD4+ and CD8+T cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases.
32389849,Based on these early observations, as pediatrician, we put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and give some recommendations to contain the disease.
32390285,International studies describing COVID-19 in children have shown low proportions of paediatric cases and generally a mild clinical course.
32390285,We aimed to present early data on children tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a large Australian tertiary children's hospital according to the state health department guidelines, which varied over time.
32390285,We conducted a retrospective cohort study at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.
32390285,It included all paediatric patients (aged 0-18 years) who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) or the Respiratory Infection Clinic (RIC) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
32390285,The 30-day study period commenced after the first confirmed positive case was detected at the hospital on 21<sup>st</sup> March 2020, until 19<sup>th</sup> April 2020.
32390285,We recorded epidemiological and clinical data.
32390285,There were 433 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in ED (331 (76%)) or RIC (102 (24%)).
32390285,There were 4 (0.9%) who had positive SARS-CoV-2 detected, none of whom were admitted to hospital or developed severe disease.
32390285,Of these SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 1/4 (25%) had a comorbidity, which was asthma.
32390285,Of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, 196/429 (46%) had comorbidities.
32390285,Risk factors for COVID-19 were identified in 4/4 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 47/429 (11%) SARS-CoV-2 negative patients.
32390285,Our study identified a very low rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in children presenting to a tertiary ED or RIC, none of whom were admitted to hospital.
32390285,A high proportion of patients who were SARS-CoV-2 negative had comorbidities.
32390367,Although some information on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a few selected cases has been reported, data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized therewith in South Korea are lacking.
32390367,We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Yeungnam University Medical Center in Daegu, South Korea.
32390367,Sixty patients were women (61.2%), and the mean age was 55.4±17.1 years.
32390367,Thirteen patients (13.3%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).
32390367,The mean interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.7±4.5 days.
32390367,Patients who received ICU care were significantly older and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus.
32390367,The National Early Warning Score on the day of admission was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU care.
32390367,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (13/13 patients; 100%), septic shock (9/13; 69.2%), acute cardiac injury (9/13; 69.2%), and acute kidney injury (8/13; 61.5%) were more common in patients who received ICU care.
32390367,All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir).
32390367,Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%).
32390367,In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%).
32390367,Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients.
32390367,As of March 29, 2020, the mortality rate was 5.1%.
32390367,Here, we report the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients in South Korea up to March 29, 2020.
32391240,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has been treated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.
32391240,This work made an early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China based on a simple mathematical model and limited epidemiological data.
32391240,Combing characteristics of the historical epidemic, we found part of the released data is unreasonable.
32391240,Through ruling out the unreasonable data, the model predictions exhibit that the number of the cumulative 2019-nCoV cases may reach 76,000 to 230,000, with a peak of the unrecovered infectives (22,000-74,000) occurring in late February to early March.
32391240,After that, the infected cases will rapidly monotonically decrease until early May to late June, when the 2019-nCoV outbreak will fade out.
32391240,Strong anti-epidemic measures may reduce the cumulative infected cases by 40%-49%.
32391240,The improvement of medical care can also lead to about one-half transmission decrease and effectively shorten the duration of the 2019-nCoV.
32391308,December 2019 saw a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China quickly spread globally.
32391308,Currently, COVID-19, defined as the new pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), has reached over 750,000 confirmed cases worldwide.
32391308,The virus began to spread in Italy from the 22nd February, and the number of related cases is still increasing.
32391308,Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for National Healthcare System's capacity.
32391308,WHO underlines the importance of specific disease regional estimates.
32391308,Because of this, Italy aimed to put in place proportioned and controlled measures, and to guarantee adequate funding to both increase the number of ICU beds and increase production of personal protective equipment.
32391308,Our aim is to investigate the current COVID-19 epidemiological context in Sardinia region (Italy) and to estimate the transmission parameters using a stochastic model to establish the number of infected, recovered, and deceased people expected.
32391308,Based on available data from official Italian and regional sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the period between 2nd and 15th March 2020.
32391308,To better reflect the actual spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst scenarios.
32391308,We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Sardinia.
32391308,Our analysis can help health authorities and policymakers to address the right interventions to deal with the rapidly expanding health emergency.
32391309,The outbreak of the current 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a worldwide health threat.
32391309,Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required.
32391309,Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed.
32391309,Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information.
32391309,In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures.
32391309,The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail.
32391309,Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low.
32391309,This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract.
32391309,However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection.
32391309,Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.
32391657,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic.
32391657,All people including children are generally susceptible to COVID-19, but the condition is relatively mild for children.
32391657,The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples.
32391657,The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infections.
32391657,Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
32391657,The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.
32391657,For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.
32391660,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grade B infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32391660,In pace with the spreading of the disease, biosafety risk of the biological specimen preservation in biobanks has been significantly increased and biosafety protection during biological specimen preservation become increasingly important.
32391660,According to the related national rules and the corresponding guidelines of Chinese Medical Association, this paper introduced the etiology about SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology about COVID-19, and the biosafety protection principles of individuals and biological specimen storage places in the process of personal protection, protection of collection, transport, handling, preservation, detection, post-detection disposal and emergencies of biological specimen.
32391660,Emphasized to carry out a strict biosafety-risk assessment on biological specimen basing on virus load information, infectivity, and sample type (possible contact transmission, aerosol transmission, and fecal oral transmission).
32391746,Staff surveillance is crucial during the containment phase of a pandemic to help reduce potential healthcare-associated transmission and sustain good staff morale.
32391746,During an outbreak of SARS-COV-2 with community transmission, our institution used an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers (HCWs).
32391746,Our strategy comprised 3 key components: (1) enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's staff clinic for monitoring; (2) conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19; and (3) outbreak investigation and management.
32391746,Over a 16-week surveillance period, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs with ARI symptoms.
32391746,Two of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with intrahospital HCW-HCW transmission; we also detected 1 family cluster and 2 clusters among HCWs who shared accommodation.
32391746,No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted.
32391746,Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic.
32391746,An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs.
32391746,With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs.
32391746,Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.
32391908,In addition to moving people and goods, ships can spread disease.
32391908,Vessel trajectory data from ship Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) is available online and can be extracted and analyzed, as we illustrate in the case of the current coronavirus epidemic.
32391908,This data should be included in epidemiological models of disease transmission to complement air traffic data and inform operational responses.
32392331,To illustrate the extent of transmission, identify affecting risk factors and estimate epidemiological modeling parameters of SARS-CoV-2 in household setting.
32392331,We enrolled 35 confirmed index cases and their 148 household contacts, January 2020-February 2020, in Zhuhai, China.
32392331,All participants were interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires.
32392331,Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals.
32392331,Epidemiological, demographic and clinical data (when available) were collected.
32392331,Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate (SIR) in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic.
32392331,Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility.
32392331,Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32392331,The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI; 3.4 to 5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI; 4.3 to 6.2 days), respectively.
32392331,Early isolation of patients with COVID-19 and prioritizing rapid contact investigation, followed by active symptom monitoring and periodic laboratory evaluation, should be initiated immediately after confirming patients to address the underlying determinants driving the continuing pandemic.
32392337,Few paediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported and we know little about the epidemiology in children, though more is known about other coronaviruses.
32392337,We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures.
32392337,We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations.
32392337,The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32392337,We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers.
32392337,English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included.
32392337,Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review.
32392337,Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies.
32392337,Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection.
32392337,Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted.
32392337,Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission.
32392337,Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32392337,This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.
32393161,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 03 May 2020: notifications = 6,784; deaths = 89.
32393161,The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia.
32393161,Currently new notifications in Australia are mostly considered to be locally-acquired with some cases still reported among people with recent overseas travel.
32393161,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case or known cluster, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case.
32393161,The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
32393161,The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.3%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (7.1%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.7%) and the United Kingdom (15.4%).
32393161,The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases.
32393161,Internationally, cases continue to increase.
32393161,The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.
32393346,Adequate personal protective equipment is needed to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.
32393346,Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies.
32393346,The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.
32393346,Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75-7.54).
32393346,No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.
32393346,Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.
32393346,The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.
32393346,Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.
32393346,A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.
32393346,Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.
32393346,Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.
32393346,Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.
32393346,Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.
32393346,Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.
32394986,The rapid propagation of SARS-CoV-2 requires the generation of evidence to help mitigate its global damage.
32394986,The precise measurement with the appropriate clinical and epidemiological indicators associated with COVID-19 is a necessary step in reducing the individual and population burden of the current pandemic.
32394986,These unprecedented times have raised a challenge for epidemiologists of chronic diseases and have required a practical approach &quot;to do something to help during this disaster&quot;.
32394986,The options include returning to clinical care or resorting to online textbooks and resources for accelerated courses on the research of outbreaks.
32394986,However, being aware of the magnitude of individual suffering endured by so many, including many esteemed and close colleagues, becomes a personal challenge of enormous proportions.
32394986,The arts and other forms of humanities can help re-establish equilibrium, both during the pandemic and especially after it.
32395487,The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency, but the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are not fully described.
32395487,We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city; and to develop a multivariate model to predict the risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital (ProLOS).
32395487,The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Zhejiang province from January to February 20, 2020.
32395487,Medical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed.
32395487,Patients were categorized into the ProLOS and non-ProLOS groups by hospital length of stay greater and less than 14 days, respectively.
32395487,Conventional descriptive statistics were applied.
32395487,Multivariate regression model was built to predict the risk of ProLOS, with variables selected using stepwise approach.
32395487,A total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included for quantitative analysis, including 25 (33%) patients in the ProLOS group.
32395487,ProLOS patients were more likely to have history of traveling to Wuhan (68% <i>vs.</i> 28%; P=0.002).
32395487,Patients in the ProLOS group showed lower neutrophil counts [median (IQR): 2.50 (1.77-3.23) ×10<sup>9</sup>/L <i>vs.</i> 2.90 (2.21-4.19) ×10<sup>9</sup>/L; P=0.048], higher partial thrombin time (PT) (13.42±0.63 <i>vs.</i> 13.10±0.48 s; P=0.029), lower D-Dimer [0.26 (0.22-0.46) <i>vs.</i> 0.44 (0.32-0.84) mg/L; P=0.012].
32395487,There was no patient died and no severe case in our cohort.
32395487,The overall LOS was 11 days (IQR, 5-15 days).
32395487,The median cost for a hospital stay was 7,388.19 RMB (IQR, 5,085.39-11,145.44).
32395487,The prediction model included five variables of procalcitonin, heart rate, epidemiological history, lymphocyte count and cough.
32395487,The discrimination of the model was 84.8% (95% CI: 75.3% to 94.4%).
32395487,Our study described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city and found that the illness was less severe than that in the core epidemic region.
32395487,A multivariate model was developed to predict ProLOS, which showed good discrimination.
32395541,The &quot;novel&quot; coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated &quot;COVID-19&quot;) is the third coronavirus outbreak emerging during the past two decades.
32395541,This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
32395541,Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the &quot;wrong virus&quot; at the &quot;wrong time&quot;).
32395541,These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination.
32395541,Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.
32395541,Everybody should be inexcusably aware that this is not a drill, and that the consequences of inadequate action will be tragedy.
32395567,Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originated in the Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in November 2019 and has since been declared a pandemic by the WHO.
32395567,COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease, primarily affecting the respiratory system.
32395567,Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on respiratory specimens is considered the reference by which to diagnose COVID-19.
32395567,However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain.
32395567,As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered.
32395567,Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms.
32395567,In this article, we review the typical imaging findings in COVID-19, the differential diagnoses, and common complications.
32395788,On 2 March 2020, Tunisia has reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19.
32395788,Since then, the disease has affected about 700 persons in the country.
32395788,The purpose of our study was to report epidemiological, clinical, radiological and therapeutic features of patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted in the pneumology department.
32395788,We extracted the data of the consequetive 20 patients managed in the department of pneumology B at Abderrahmen Mami hospital, from March, 26 to April, 8, 2020.
32395788,The median age was 61 years old [41-85].
32395788,There were 9 men and 11 women.
32395788,Underlying disorders were observed in 16 patients (80%).
32395788,Five patients were health care workers.
32395788,Three patients did not have any known exposure.
32395788,Common symptoms included fever (100%), shortness of breath (70%) and cough (70%).
32395788,Computed tomography scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities in 7/9 cases.
32395788,Fifteen patients received both chloroquine and azithromycin.
32395788,Fourteen patients (70%) were discharged before April, 8, 2020.
32395788,Reported complications were: hypokalemia (3 cases), pulmonary embolism (2 cases) and QT prolongation (1 case).
32395788,One patient died from acute cardiac injury.
32395788,Knowing the different aspects of moderate and severe forms of the disease can contribute to advance in infection control strategies.
32395789,The Maghreb Central, like all the countries of the world, was strongly mobilized (governments, ministries of health, population, civil society) in the response against COVID-19, immediately after the registration of the first cases on its territory (end of February, beginning of March) and according to pre-established control strategies.
32395789,Describe the perceptions of health professionals in the Central Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) as to the Strengths/Opportunities and Weaknesses/Threats of the national response plans against COVID-19, during the first weeks of their execution, and report their proposals for optimizing the performance of control strategies.
32395789,This is a qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals in the Maghreb Central regarding their experience of the first six weeks of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
32395789,The data was collected using the &quot;Delphi&quot; technique in one turn, based on an electronic form such as &quot;Google Form&quot;, developed according to SWOT analysis.
32395789,The respondents' verbatim was grouped into homogeneous groups of items, the occurrence of which was subsequently measured.
32395789,A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years.
32395789,The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe.
32395789,The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics.
32395789,The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.
32395793,SARS-CoV-2 infection has to be confirmed by virological diagnosis.
32395793,Multiple diagnostic tests are available without enough perspective on their reliability.
32395793,Therefore, it is important to choose the most suitable test according to its sensitivity and specificity but also to the stage of the disease.
32395793,Currently, the RT-PCR detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples is the most reliable test to confirm the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32395793,It has to be done in Class II biological safety laboratory.
32395793,However, it may lack sensitivity, particularly in the advanced phase of infection, and depends closely on the samples' quality.
32395793,Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests.
32395793,Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management.
32395793,The detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is better used for epidemiological analyses.
32395793,Research should be encouraged to overcome the limits of the currently available diagnostic tests.
32396163,Early identification of patients with novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who may develop critical illness is of great importance and may aid in delivering proper treatment and optimizing use of resources.
32396163,To develop and validate a clinical score at hospital admission for predicting which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness based on a nationwide cohort in China.
32396163,Collaborating with the National Health Commission of China, we established a retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions as of January 31, 2020.
32396163,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-GRAM).
32396163,The score provides an estimate of the risk that a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 will develop critical illness.
32396163,Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
32396163,Data from 4 additional cohorts in China hospitalized with COVID-19 were used to validate the score.
32396163,Data were analyzed between February 20, 2020 and March 17, 2020.
32396163,Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, critical illness was defined as the composite measure of admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death.
32396163,The development cohort included 1590 patients. the mean (SD) age of patients in the cohort was 48.9 (15.7) years; 904 (57.3%) were men.
32396163,The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%).
32396163,From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24).
32396163,The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93).
32396163,The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/).
32396163,In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness.
32396550,Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is a major cause of death and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries, however, the etiologic agents are often undetermined due to the lack of molecular diagnostics in hospitals and clinics.
32396550,To examine evidence for select viral infections among patients with SARI in northern Vietnam, we studied 348 nasopharyngeal samples from military and civilian patients admitted to 4 hospitals in the greater Hanoi area from 2017-2019.
32396550,Initial screening for human respiratory viral pathogens was performed in Hanoi, Vietnam at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) or the Military Institute of Preventative Medicine (MIPM), and an aliquot was shipped to Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore for validation.
32396550,Patient demographics were recorded and used to epidemiologically describe the infections.
32396550,Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses.
32396550,Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%).
32396550,Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7-22.9).
32396550,As influenza A and B viruses were commonly associated with SARI and are treatable, SARI patients entering these hospitals would benefit if the hospitals were able to adapt onsite molecular diagnostics.
32397011,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have spread throughout China.
32397011,Previous studies predominantly focused on its place of origin, Wuhan, causing over estimation of the disease severity due to selection bias.
32397011,We analyzed 465 confirmed cases in Zhejiang province to determine the epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of COVID-19.
32397011,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management data from qRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 17, 2020, to January 31, 2020, were collected, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis for independent predictors of severe/critical-type COVID-19 and bioinformatic analysis for features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.
32397011,Among 465 COVID-19 patients, median age was 45 years, while hypertension, diabetes, and chronic liver disease were the most common comorbidities.
32397011,History of exposure to the epidemic area was present in 170 (36.56%) and 185 (39.78%) patients were clustered in 77 families.
32397011,Severe/critical-type of COVID-19 developed in 49 (10.54%) patients.
32397011,Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea/vomiting was reported in 58 (12.47%) patients.
32397011,Multivariate analysis revealed eight risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19.
32397011,Glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 60 (12.90%) and 218(46.88%) patients, respectively.
32397011,Bioinformatics showed four single amino acid mutations and one amino acid position loss in SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province, with more similarity to humans than to viruses.
32397011,SARS-CoV-2 showed virological mutations and more human transmission in Zhejiang province, indicating considerable epidemiological and clinical changes.
32397011,Caution in glucocorticoid and antibiotics use is advisable.
32397138,The global anxiety and a significant threat to public health due to the current COVID-19 pandemic reiterate the need for active surveillance for the zoonotic virus diseases of pandemic potential.
32397138,Influenza virus due to its wide host range and zoonotic potential poses such a significant threat to public health.
32397138,Swine serve as a &quot;mixing vessel&quot; for influenza virus reassortment and evolution which as a result may facilitate the emergence of new strains or subtypes of zoonotic potential.
32397138,In this context, the currently available scientific data hold a high significance to unravel influenza virus epidemiology and evolution.
32397138,With this objective, the current systematic review summarizes the original research articles and case reports of all the four types of influenza viruses reported in swine populations worldwide.
32397138,A total of 281 articles were found eligible through screening of PubMed and Google Scholar databases and hence were included in this systematic review.
32397138,The highest number of research articles (<i>n</i> = 107) were reported from Asia, followed by Americas (<i>n</i> = 97), Europe (<i>n</i> = 55), Africa (<i>n</i> = 18), and Australia (<i>n</i> = 4).
32397138,The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common influenza A virus subtypes reported in swine in most countries across the globe, however, few strains of influenza B, C, and D viruses were also reported in certain countries.
32397138,Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine.
32397138,Inter-species transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses.
32397138,Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses.
32397138,These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics.
32397286,The number of screening tests carried out in France and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the infection fatality ratio (IFR).
32397286,The main objective of this work is to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID-19 and to deduce the IFR during the observation window in France.
32397286,We develop a `mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR epidemiological model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method.
32397286,The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor ×8 (95%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8) based on hospital death counting data.
32397286,Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8% (95%-CI: 0.45-1.25).
32397286,This IFR is consistent with previous findings in China (0.66%) and in the UK (0.9%) and lower than the value previously computed on the Diamond Princess cruse ship data (1.3%).
32397688,The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that impacts the lower respiratory tract.
32397688,The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32397688,To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
32397688,Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
32397688,Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.

32398569,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe.
32398569,In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease.
32398569,In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date.
32398569,We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.
32398569,We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children.
32398569,Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members.
32398569,The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days.
32398569,The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days.
32398569,Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza).
32398569,Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic.
32398569,The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%).
32398569,Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue.
32398569,Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered.
32398569,Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign.
32398569,Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally.
32398569,Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates.
32398569,Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit.
32398569,Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.
32398569,Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.
32398569,Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.
32398569,Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.
32398901,The phenomenal speed of COVID-19 has subjected the public health professionals worldwide to struggle to subdue the spread of the disease and its impact of the affected societies.
32398901,The limited biomedical and epidemiological understanding of COVID-19 along with the lack of vaccines and therapeutics have led to the reception of draconian measures from the societal safety domain, limiting human interaction through social distancing.
32398901,Grounded on the adopted approaches, interventions in sero-prevalence studies, mobilisation of the primary health care (PHC) sector, as well as target socially vulnerable groups should be taken into consideration by heath authorities.
32398954,Coronavirus (CoV) has been one of the major pandemic threats to human health in the last two decades.
32398954,The human coronavirus was first identified in 1960s.
32398954,CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human deaths worldwide.
32398954,Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020.
32398954,Its risks and pandemic potential have brought global consideration.
32398954,We summarized epidemiology, virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.
32401210,In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32401210,Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan.
32401210,Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help.
32401210,This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo.
32401210,We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32401210,In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed.
32401210,We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection.
32401210,The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS.
32401210,All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0).
32401210,Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom.
32401210,Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help.
32401210,The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0).
32401210,Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital.
32401210,Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly.
32401210,Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography.
32401210,The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital.
32401210,Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown.
32401210,These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.
32401211,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the latest pandemic of the digital age.
32401211,With the internet harvesting large amounts of data from the general population in real time, public databases such as Google Trends (GT) and the Baidu Index (BI) can be an expedient tool to assist public health efforts.
32401211,The aim of this study is to apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine the utility of providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics.
32401211,An epidemiologic time series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020, to April 6, 2020.
32401211,BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was used for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain, and the US states of New York and Washington.
32401211,These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19.
32401211,Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports.
32401211,Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia and ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r&gt;0.60, P&lt;.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19.
32401211,GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated real-world confirmed cases by 12 days (r=0.85, SD 0.10 and r=0.76, SD 0.09, respectively, P&lt;.001).
32401211,Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag greater than 1 week compared to new daily cases, while searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19.
32401211,This study demonstrates the utility of digital epidemiology in providing helpful surveillance data of disease outbreaks like COVID-19.
32401211,Although certain online search trends for this disease were influenced by media coverage, many search terms reflected clinical manifestations of the disease and showed strong correlations with real-world cases and deaths.
32401228,Background The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) is quite a challenging experience for the world.
32401228,At the moment of birth, the fetus is prepared to face the challenge of labor and the exposure to the outside world, meaning that labor and birth represent the first extrauterine major exposure to a complex microbiota.
32401228,The vagina, which is a canal for reproduction, is by evolution separated (but not far) from the anus and urethra.
32401228,Passing through the birthing canal is a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of vaginal and gut microorganisms for the vertical transmission of microbiota not only from our mothers and grandmothers but also from earlier ancestors.
32401228,Methods Many national and international instructions have been developed since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan in China.
32401228,All of them pointed out hygiene measures, social distancing and avoidance of social contacts as the most important epidemiological preventive measures.
32401228,Pregnancy and neonatal periods are considered as high risk for Covid-19 infection.
32401228,Results The instructions defined the care for pregnant women in the delivery room, during a hospital stay and after discharge.
32401228,The controversial procedures in the care of Covid-19-suspected or -positive asymptomatic women in labor were: mode of delivery, companion during birth and labor, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and visits during a hospital stay.
32401228,Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm.
32402329,The recent pandemic caused by the novel human coronavirus, referrred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not only is having a great impact on the health care systems and economies in all continents but it is also causing radical changes of common habits and life styles.
32402329,The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown.
32402329,However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
32402329,In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features.
32402329,A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.
32403010,Several SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been developed recently.
32403010,The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
32403010,Two quantitative automated immunoassays (Maglumi™2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed.
32403010,This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers.
32403010,Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan.
32403010,Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records.
32403010,Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples.
32403010,Maglumi™ IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4 % versus 64.3 %).
32403010,Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively.
32403010,The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands.
32403010,The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70 %) without any significant differences.
32403010,The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91 %-94 %) after 14 days.
32403010,This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.
32403010,This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32403911,The infection with the novel SARS Cov-2 corona virus, the cause of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, possessing its origin in the Chinese province Hubei, has reached the extent of a global pandemic within a few months.
32403911,After aerosol infection, most people experience mild respiratory infection with cold symptoms such as cough and fever, and healing within two weeks.
32403911,In about 5% of those infected, however, a severe course develops with the occurrence of multiple sub pleural bronchopulmonary infiltrates and even death as a result of respiratory failure.
32403911,The corona virus pandemic has multiple impacts on social life that have not been seen before.
32403911,For example, the government adopted measures to curb the exponential spread of the virus, which included a significant reduction in social contacts.
32403911,Furthermore, the specialist societies recommended that no elective treatments be carried out during the pandemic period.
32403911,This review article considers epidemiological aspects of novel corona virus infection and presents both the clinical as well the possible economic effects of the pandemic on gynaecology, obstetrics and reproductive medicine in Germany in the past, present and future.
32403911,In addition, useful preventive measures for daily clinical work and the previously known scientific findings dealing with the impact of corona virus on pregnancy and birth are discussed.
32404219,As in other European countries, the current Covid-19 pandemic has not only massively restricted normal life in Germany, it is also having a significant effect on medical treatment, particularly in the areas of child and adolescent psychiatric care, as well as on university teaching.
32404219,The federal structure of Germany and epidemiological differences between individual federal states has had a crucial impact on the regulations issued and their success.
32404219,During the last number of weeks, tele-child-psychiatry and psychotherapy have increased, and outpatient services have been used cautiously and sparingly.
32404219,Medical staff numbers will be augmented by doctors and nurses returning from retirement and also by medical students on a voluntary basis.
32404219,The federal government has warned that discrepancies in education will increase due to the closure of schools.
32404219,Questions of child protection are currently of particular importance in the context of such closures and the non-availability of day-care centres.
32404473,Countries globally are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly two million cases and 120 000 deaths occurring within 4 months of the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in December 2019 in China.
32404473,Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus.
32404473,By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays.
32404473,By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays.
32404473,Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses.
32404473,Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response.
32404473,However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive.
32404473,Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals.
32404473,This review aimed to summarise the current available information for diagnoses of cases and to aid laboratories and healthcare workers to select the best assays and procedures.
32404786,To describe the characteristics of clinical manifestations of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Chongqing.
32404786,All 25 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RNA-PCR) were admitted from the 4 designated treatment hospitals of 2019-nCoV in Chongqing from January 19 to March 12, 2020.
32404786,Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
32404786,The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing.
32404786,Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females.
32404786,The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years).
32404786,All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province.
32404786,These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases.
32404786,No severe or critical cases were identified.
32404786,The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%).
32404786,The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days.
32404786,In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well.
32404786,All Lymphocyte counts were normal.
32404786,There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases.
32404786,There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung.
32404786,All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir.
32404786,The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days.
32404786,There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment.
32404786,All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.
32404786,The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.
32404786,RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.
32405079,Novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide, and tracking laboratory indexes during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 can provide a reference for patients in other countries and regions.
32405079,We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days.
32405079,Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after admission, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased.
32405079,On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values.
32405079,From 8 to 14 days of admission, the patient's condition improved, hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued.
32405079,The number of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP decreased rapidly.
32405079,On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased.
32405079,Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis.
32405079,In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease.
32405079,Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.
32405095,The emergence of the Covid-19 and subsequent pandemic has led to the most substantive large-scale, open, and public social discussion of epidemiology and science in recent history.
32405095,In the United States, extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic.
32405095,We hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment.
32405095,In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event like a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations.
32405095,Data were obtained on March 17-18, 2020, from a sample of 242 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users.
32405095,Respondents completed a 49-question survey consisting of key socidemographic variables, political affiliation, religious commitment, and two iterations of the <i>Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory</i> (one for March 2020, and one for December 2019 using retrospective recall).
32405095,Changes in mean level of trust and interaction with political affiliation and/or religious commitment were assessed using mixed ANOVA via the general linear model.
32405095,On a scale from 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust), the mean level of trust in science and scientists was static; 3.82 in December 2019, and 3.81 in March 2020.
32405095,Conservative political orientation and high religious commitment were associated with significantly less overall trust in science; the interaction effect suggested that liberal trust in science decreased slightly from December 2019 to March 2020, while conservative trust increased slightly.
32405095,Counter to our expectations, the overall level of trust in science remained static after the first several months of Covid-19 in the United States, though there is some evidence that political orientation was associated with magnitude and directionality of change in trust.
32405095,Continued examination of these trends is important for understanding public response to epidemiologic recommendations.
32405152,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32405152,It emerged as a global pandemic early in 2020, affecting more than 2000 countries and territories.
32405152,The infection is highly contagious with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children.
32405152,It spreads through person-to-person contact, via aerosol and droplets.
32405152,The practice of social distancing - maintaining a distance of 1 - 2 meters or 6 feet -- between people has been widely recommended to slow or halt the spread.
32405152,This places orthodontists at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection.
32405152,The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during disease crisis.
32405152,This should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility.
32405152,A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March, 2020 using (CORD-19 2020) dataset<b>,</b> PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics.
32405152,This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures.
32405152,Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak.
32405152,Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required.
32405152,Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings.
32405152,Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging.
32405152,Further studies are required.
32405162,An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world.
32405162,It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious.
32405162,We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research.
32405162,They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs.
32405162,We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules.
32405162,The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days.
32405162,Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients.
32405162,Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically.
32405162,During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one.
32405162,The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range.
32405162,All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection.
32405162,No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test.
32405162,In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.
32405603,The prevalence and prognosis of digestive system involvement, including gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury, in patients with COVID-19 remains largely unknown.
32405603,We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system.
32405603,In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020.
32405603,The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched.
32405603,We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients, and excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (&lt;10 cases).
32405603,Extracted data included author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching; and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases.
32405603,Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates.
32405603,We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2-5; range 0-15; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=74%).
32405603,The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10-21; range: 2-57; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms.
32405603,The pooled prevalence of abnormal liver functions (12 studies, n=1267) was 19% (9-32; range 1-53; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=96%).
32405603,Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1·60 [95% CI 1·09-2·36]; p=0·0020; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=44%) and liver injury (2·20 [1·60-3·02]; p&lt;0·00001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=36%) compared with those with non-severe disease.
32405603,Patients in Hubei province, where the initial COVID-19 outbreak occurred, were more likely to present with abnormal liver functions (p&lt;0·0001) compared with those outside of Hubei.
32405603,Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients.
32405603,10% (95% CI 4-19; range 3-23; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features.
32405603,Patients who presented with gastrointestinal system involvement had delayed diagnosis (standardised mean difference 2·85 [95% CI 0·22-5·48]; p=0·030; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=73%).
32405603,Patients with gastrointestinal involvement had a higher prevalence of complication (OR 2·51 [95% CI 1·62-3·89]; p&lt;0·0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%).
32405603,Our study showed that digestive symptoms and liver injury are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19.
32405603,Increased attention should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients.
32405603,None.
32406852,The Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) is a 2-year training program in applied epidemiology.
32406852,FETP graduates have contributed significantly to improvements in surveillance systems, control of infectious diseases, and outbreak investigations in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR).
32406852,Knowing their instrumental roles during the COVID-19 crisis, this study aimed to assess the awareness and preparedness of FETP graduates in three EMR countries to respond to COVID-19 pandemic.
32406852,An online survey was sent to FETP graduates in 3 countries in the EMR in March 2020.
32406852,The FETP graduates were contacted by email and requested to fill an online survey.
32406852,Sufficient number of responses were received from three countries only including Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen.
32406852,Few responses were received from other countries and therefore they were excluded from the analysis.
32406852,The questionnaire comprised a series of questions pertaining to socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19, and preparedness to respond to COVID-19.
32406852,This study included a total of 57 FETP graduates (20 from Jordan, 13 from Sudan, and 24 from Yemen).
32406852,A total of 31 (54%) graduates had attended training on COVID-19, 29 (51%) are member of a rapid response team against COVID-19 and 54 (95%) had previous experience in response to disease outbreaks or health emergencies.
32406852,The vast majority were aware of the main symptoms, mode of transmission, high risk groups, and aware of how to use personal protective equipment.
32406852,A total of 46 (81%) respondents considered themselves well prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak and 40 (70%) reported that they currently have a role in supporting the country efforts in the management of COVID-19 outbreak.
32406852,The FETP graduates in Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen were fully aware of the epidemiology COVID-19 and the safety measures and they are well positioned to investigate and respond to COVID-19 pandemic.
32406852,Therefore, they should be properly and efficiently utilized by the ministries of health to investigate and respond to the current COVID-19 crisis where the needs are vastly growing and access to outside experts becomes limited.
32407289,As of 12th April 2020, a total of 389 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Jordan.
32407289,To control this imminent threat, Jordan has enforced public health infection prevention and control measures, called for social distancing, seized all forms of inbound and outbound movement/ international travel, and enacted the Defence Law that transferred the authority to Minister of Defence to work and formulate orders according to the situation.
32407289,In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed.
32407289,This viewpoint suggested different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations contribution.
32407289,It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic and financial impacts.
32407289,This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine.
32407289,In specific, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness towards public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation/ active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts.
32407289,It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.
32407507,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV-2 has shown once again that coronaviruses (CoVs) in animals are potential sources for epidemics in humans.
32407507,Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen of swine with a worldwide distribution.
32407507,Here, we implemented and described an approach to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV following its emergence in the pig population.
32407507,We performed an integrated analysis of full genome sequence data from 21 newly-sequenced viruses, along with comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data collected globally over the last 15 years.
32407507,We found four distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV, which differ in their geographic circulation patterns.
32407507,Interestingly, we identified more frequent intra- and inter-lineage recombination and higher virus genetic diversity in the Chinese lineages compared with the US lineage where pigs are raised in different farming systems and ecological environments.
32407507,Most recombination breakpoints are located in the ORF1ab gene rather than in genes encoding structural proteins.
32407507,We also identified five amino acids under positive selection in the spike protein suggesting a role for adaptive evolution.
32407507,According to structural mapping, three positively selected sites are located in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, which is the most likely involved in binding to a carbohydrate receptor, while the other two are located in or near the fusion peptide of the S2 subunit and thus might affect membrane fusion.
32407507,Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission.
32407507,Our findings provide new insights into the evolution and dispersal of PDCoV that contribute to our understanding of the critical factors involved in coronaviruses emergence.
32407507,Coronaviruses (CoVs) exhibit a pronounced propensity for interspecies transmission as illustrated by important emerging viruses in humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS)-CoV, as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 that is causing a major human pandemic.
32407507,A better understanding of the evolutionary process leading to viral emergence may help unravel the principles of cross-species transmission and therefore assist in preventing future introductions into new host populations.
32407507,Here, we examined the evolution and spread of an emerging coronavirus that likely transmitted from birds to pigs and caused sustained epidemics in Asia and the United States.
32407507,We integrated viral full genome sequence analysis and comprehensive surveillance data to examine the evolution of emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and in particular the factors driving ongoing circulation and recent cases in China.
32407507,We found evidence for adaptive evolution of this emerging virus in the absence of vaccine immune pressure, with important amino acids under positive selection, as well as frequent inter- and intra-lineage recombination events in the Asian lineages.
32407507,Breeding patterns and ecological environment could play an important role in swine coronavirus evolution, leading to differences in recombination and population diversity.
32407507,Using phylogeographic approaches, we further shed light on the dispersal history and dynamics of the China lineage of PDCoV.
32407507,Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geographic dispersal of genetic lineages of PDCoV in China and suggests that southern China acted as a source of transmission.
32407507,Modeling how the virus spread in China will allow the prioritization of areas for swine coronavirus surveillance in the future.
32407507,These findings have important implications for preventing the emergence of coronaviruses in livestock and for controlling their spread in Asian countries.
32407893,The transmission of COVID-19 is about to come under control within China, however, an emerging challenge to the Chinese authorities is reverse transmission due to COVID-19 patients/carriers evacuating from overseas to China.
32407893,We analysed the epidemiological characteristics of 311 Chinese citizens evacuated from Iran.
32407893,All confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst the returnees were displayed by the spatial distribution pattern of the extent of COVID-19 infection.
32407893,Characteristics that differed significantly amongst these returnees compared to the original infected cohorts in Gansu were mean age, occupation and sex.
32407893,Differences observed between infected patients and non-patients amongst returnees were age, sex, race, occupation, the use of facemasks, and residential situation in Iran.
32407893,The clinical features that were significantly related to infection were chill, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea.
32407893,Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated that infected returnees had resided within Iranian provinces that had experienced high levels of COVID-19.
32407893,The spatial distribution of the original homes of these returnees before departure for Iran demonstrated that returnees will largely return to northwest China, to regions that have only experienced low levels of infection within China.
32407893,Blocking the reverse transmission of COVID-19 is critical in preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19.
32408119,On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus was declared a global pandemic.
32408119,The disease was named COVID-19 standing for coronavirus disease 2019.
32408119,The objectives were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
32408119,In this prospective descriptive study, 15 confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 between 18th March and April 7, 2020 were followed-up till discharge.
32408119,There were 15 reported patients infected by 3 imported index cases from Europe.
32408119,The mean age of the patients was 28.06 (SD: 16.42 years).
32408119,The patients' age stratification was as follows: 0-5 (2, 13.3%); 6-18 (2, 13.3); 19-50 (10, 66.7%), and 51-64 years (1, 6.7%).
32408119,The patients were male (9, 60.0%) and female (6, 40.0%).
32408119,Most of the patients had mild disease severity (13, 86.7%), followed by mild-moderate (1, 6.7%) and moderate-severe (1, 6.7%).
32408119,The study revealed that 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 9 patients were symptomatic.
32408119,The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%).
32408119,All patients were recovered and discharged over a median of 8 between 8 and 21 days.
32408119,The mean and Std. deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21).
32408119,All COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission.
32408119,The majority of cases were mild illnesses with full recovery.
32408679,The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in different ways.
32408679,Not only are people's lives and livelihoods affected, but the virus has also affected people's lifestyles.
32408679,In the research sector, there have been significant changes, and new research is coming very strongly in the related fields of virology and epidemiology.
32408679,Similar trends were observed after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) episodes of 2003 and 2012, respectively.
32408679,Analyzing 20 years of published scientific papers, this article points out the highlights of coronavirus-related research.
32408679,Significant progress is observed in the past research related to virology, epidemiology, infectious diseases among others.
32408679,However, in research linked to public health, its governance, technology, and risk communication there seem to be gap areas.
32408679,Although the World Health Organization (WHO) global research road map has identified social science-related research as a priority area, more focus needs to be given in the upcoming days for multi, cross and trans-disciplinary research related to public health and disaster risk reduction.
32408729,This paper adds to the series of systematic rapid living reviews, started in April 2020, to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19 pandemic.
32408729,To present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020.
32408729,A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020.
32408729,Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after Covid-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for Covid-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after Covid-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest.
32408729,Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis.
32408729,They consist of 7 guidelines, 1 scoping review, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 descriptive studies (qualitative), 1 case series, 1 case report, and 35 expert opinions.
32408729,This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020.
32408729,The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase.
32408729,Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.
32408808,Was there quality in the Chinese epidemiological surveillance system during the COVID-19 pandemic?
32408808,Using data of World Health Organization's situation reports (until situation report 55), an objective analysis was realized to answer this important question.
32408808,Fulfillment of Benford's law (first digit law) is a rapid tool to suggest good data quality.
32408808,Results suggest that China had an acceptable quality in its epidemiological surveillance system.
32408808,Furthermore, more detailed and complete analyses could complement the evaluation of the Chinese surveillance system.
32409502,Patients with obesity are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections.
32409502,However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear.
32409502,We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China.
32409502,A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen were included.
32409502,Underweight was defined as a BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and obesity as ≥28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
32409502,Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission.
32409502,Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (<i>P</i> = 0.03) and fever (<i>P</i> = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese.
32409502,Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, <i>P</i> = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, <i>P</i> = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and cancer, and drug used for treatment.
32409502,Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, <i>P</i> = 0.003).
32409502,In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19.
32409502,As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.
32409547,We sequenced four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from Malaysia during the second wave of infection and found unique mutations which suggest local evolution.
32409547,Circulating Malaysian strains represent introductions from different countries, particularly during the first wave of infection.
32409547,Genome sequencing is important for understanding local epidemiology.
32410206,Background Clinical characteristics of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present differently within and outside the epicenter of Wuhan, China.
32410206,More clinical investigations are needed.
32410206,Objective The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapeutic methods of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, China.
32410206,Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People's Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China.
32410206,Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis.
32410206,Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included.
32410206,The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32410206,Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments.
32410206,Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men.
32410206,The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days.
32410206,Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19.
32410206,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group.
32410206,Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count.
32410206,The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%).
32410206,Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon α2b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription.
32410206,The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-α2b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously.
32410206,Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.
32410206,We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-α2b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.
32410236,Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like SARS-CoV-2, which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China.
32410236,SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent.
32410236,We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020.
32410236,This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas.
32410236,Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions.
32410236,More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients.
32410236,Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED/inpatients tested were positive.
32410236,The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged &lt;25 years old (2%).
32410236,County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions.
32410236,Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2.
32410236,Data extracted for BSWH from the CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared to 25% in March 2019.
32410236,This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management.
32410236,This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population.
32410236,Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.

32410285,To explore epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 in Chongqing and establish early warning system that provides a feasible protocol for clinical assessment of COVID-19.
32410285,A retrospective cohort study of 133 confirmed COVID-19 cases was conducted from January to March, 2020.
32410285,They were assigned to mild group (n=65) and severe group (n=68).
32410285,Univariate analysis and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent predictors of severe cases.
32410285,An early warning system for COVID-19 was established, with accuracy evaluated by ROC analysis.
32410285,The age of the severe group was significantly elder than that of the mild group (P&lt;0.05).
32410285,There was no significant difference in epidemiological characteristics except age between the two groups (P&gt;0.05).
32410285,Multivariate Logistic regression showed that the age, shortness of breath, lymphocyte count, PCT level, LDH level, APTT level, and CRP level were independent predictors for severe COVID-19.
32410285,COVID-19 prediction model (including independent risk factors) was established, showing a high accuracy and capability for predicting higher risk of severe COVID-19 (with a AUC value of 0.8842, sensitivity value of 84.33%, and specificity value of 96.89%).
32410285,According to the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Chongqing, a positive correlation between age and severity of COVID-19 was found, but no association between epidemiological history and disease severity was seen.
32410285,Prediction model has a high sensitivity and is easy to use, which provides a strong basis for the early clinical evaluation on the severity of COVID-19.

32410319,The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus, that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens global health.
32410319,Emerging evidence and past experience from other coronaviruses suggests that people with underlying liver disease including viral hepatitis could be at risk of disease severity and mortality.
32410319,However, with the present relatively low screening rates for the most prevalent viral hepatitis - Hepatitis B and C, many COVID-19 cases especially in low middle income countries are unlikely to be screened for viral hepatitis coinfection.
32410319,Without active screening, little will be known about the clinical and epidemiological manifestations which could negatively impact public health efforts.
32410319,In this commentary, we call for systematic and integrated screening of Hepatitis B and C for COVID-19 confirmed patients.
32410319,We also call for guidelines for management and treatment as well as research to understand the epidemiology of coinfection This article is protected by copyright.

32410517,The epidemiology of suicide has identified numerous psychiatric and occupational risk factors.
32410517,The circumstances surrounding a suicide are fundamental to determining whether its characteristics will play a crucial role in the decision-making process.
32410517,The state of emergency arising from the Covid-19 pandemic has introduced a new element, given the general concern and feelings of alarm which are global.
32410517,The most suitable forensic method to analyse these cases is the psychological autopsy.
32410517,This study's purpose is to analyse the application of the psychological autopsy method to evaluate the impact of the pandemic where government lockdowns impose restrictions on personal freedom.
32410517,We set out to consider how far this together with other factors may induce suicide.
32410517,The literature does not as yet offer us a retrospective analysis of the influence of the global pandemic state on rates of suicide.
32410517,Accordingly, we report a forensic case and examine the critical issues and problems in the management of these cases.
32411271,On 23rd March 2020 the UK government released self-isolation guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2.
32411271,The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known.
32411271,To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation in a sample of the UK public.
32411271,This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey.
32411271,Sexual activity was measured using the following question: &quot;On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?
32411271,&quot; Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation.
32411271,The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. 868 individuals were included in this study.
32411271,There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years.
32411271,During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week.
32411271,Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing.
32411271,In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%.
32411271,Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption.
32411271,This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing.
32411271,Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings.
32411271,Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic.
32411271,Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.
32412125,In this communication, we present arguments for androgen sensitivity as a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity.
32412125,The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection.
32412125,Further, the model explains the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates among different ethnicities.
32412125,Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor.
32412125,The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.
32412125,TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS-CoV-2 for virus-cell fusion.
32412125,Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility.
32412125,In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms.
32412125,Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity.
32412125,We believe that the evidence presented in this communication warrants the initiation of trials using anti-androgen agents.
32412159,Immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk for complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32412159,However, comprehensive data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are still lacking.
32412159,We performed a multicenter nationwide observational study within the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes of the first microbiologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among SOT recipients.
32412159,Overall, 21 patients were included with a median age of 56 years (10 kidney, 5 liver, 1 pancreas, 1 lung, 1 heart and 3 combined transplantations).
32412159,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (76%), dry cough (57%), nausea (33%) and diarrhea (33%).
32412159,Ninety-five percent and 24% of patients required hospital and ICU admission, respectively, and 19% were intubated.
32412159,After a median of 33 days of follow-up, 16 patients were discharged, 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died.
32412159,These data suggest that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged SOT recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications.
32412159,These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.
32412422,The beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic dates back to December 31, 2019, when the first cases were reported in the People's Republic of China.
32412422,In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020.
32412422,The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis, and online visualization of data.
32412422,Due to an urgent need for a tool that presents important reports based on valid data sources, a team of government experts and researchers focused on the design and development of a web app intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general population.
32412422,The cross-industry standard process for data mining model was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data that provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic.
32412422,Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system; the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders; and data collection, processing, analysis, validation, and visualization.
32412422,The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and maps intended for the general public.
32412422,On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released.
32412422,The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment.
32412422,The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic.
32412422,This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.
32412512,As of March 23, 2020, suspension of non-essential activities was declared in Mexico throughout the country in order to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32412512,To analyze data on the first 1,510 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to describe the geographical distribution of the disease and its transmission dynamics.
32412512,Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic.
32412512,Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males; 44 % of initial cases were imported.
32412512,Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases; however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe.
32412512,In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.
32412693,Northern Italy has been one of the European regions reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
32412693,The pandemic spread has challenged the National Health System, requiring reallocation of most of the available health care resources to treat COVID-19-positive patients, generating a competition with other health care needs, including cancer.
32412693,Patients with cancer are at higher risk of developing critical illness after COVID-19 infection.
32412693,Thus, mitigation strategies should be adopted to reduce the likelihood of infection in all patients with cancer.
32412693,At the same time, suboptimal care and treatments may result in worse cancer-related outcome.
32412693,In this article, we attempt to estimate the individual risk-benefit balance to define personalized strategies for optimal breast cancer management, avoiding as much as possible a general untailored approach.
32412693,We discuss and report the strategies our Breast Unit adopted from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure the continuum of the best possible cancer care for our patients while mitigating the risk of infection, despite limited health care resources.
32412693,IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Managing patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is challenging.
32412693,The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics.
32412693,The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments.
32412693,This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.
32413616,The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the scarcity of evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and the potential interventions to tackle them.
32413616,Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics.
32413616,As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32413616,This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions.
32413616,Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire.
32413616,They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation.
32413616,They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care.
32413616,The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level.
32413616,This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics.
32413616,It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions.
32413616,Still, further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.
32414780,As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies.
32414780,A major challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect.
32414780,By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections.
32414780,Focusing on COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions.
32414780,Thereby, we can quantify the effect of interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers.
32414780,Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.
32415727,SARS-CoV-2 become pandemics and there is still a dearth of data about its the potentially among dermatological patients under biologics.
32415727,We aimed to assess health literacy, disease knowledge, treatment dissatisfaction and biologics attitudes toward COVID-19.
32415727,We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey on 98/105 consecutive dermatological patients treated with biologics-51 suffering from plaque psoriasis, 22 from atopic dermatitis, and 25 from hidradenitis suppurativa.
32415727,An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to (a) epidemiology, (b) pathogenesis, (c) clinical symptoms, (d) preventive measures, and (e) attitudes.
32415727,Patients data and questionnaires were collected.
32415727,Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively.
32415727,Globally, male patients (P = .001) with higher scholarity level (P = .005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19.
32415727,Patients with lower DLQI (P = .006), longer disease duration (P = .051) and lower scholarity (P = .007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy.
32415727,At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation vs discontinuation and modification vs no modification, respectively.
32415727,Dermatologists should promote COVID-19 knowledge to prevent biologics disruption.
32415870,In times of crisis, continuous adaptation is necessary.
32415870,Communication between all members of a research team is key to adapting the development of clinical trials to the context of the epidemiological crisis of coronavirus.
32415870,We are accustomed to performing day-to-day tasks to fulfil protocol requirements with precision.
32415870,To this end, we typically have had protocol-guided face-to-face visits and we have followed a detailed sequenced procedure during each visit.
32415915,In recent months, various public health measures have been implemented throughout the world in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32415915,This outbreak, and the subsequent containment policies, may have a range of potential short- and long-term impacts on the monitoring and surveillance of other conditions, such as birth defects.
32415915,In this commentary, we provide a perspective on these potential impacts on birth defects surveillance and analysis.
32415915,We discuss possible effects on clinical birth defect diagnoses, routine birth defects surveillance system activities, and epidemiologic considerations, as well as opportunities for mitigating the impact of COVID-19.
32415915,Like many other sectors of public health and medicine, birth defects surveillance programs may be faced with organizational and methodological obstacles in the wake of a changing landscape.
32415915,A better understanding of these potential challenges faced by birth defects surveillance programs could facilitate better planning and collaboration across programs to overcome barriers to core activities and to prepare for novel opportunities for research and prevention.
32415992,Today the modern world is facing an unprecedented health crisis.
32415992,The COVID-19 pandemic is putting extensive strain on health care systems, hospitals and medical workers worldwide.
32415992,Epidemiological data are emerging that COVID-19 patients with cardiac risk factors or pre-existing cardiac conditions are at increased risk for complications and mortality from COVID-19.
32415992,As we just begin to understand the pathophysiology underlying the disease, the involvement of the heart, whether through direct myocardial infection and damage or due to cardiac complications, is already evident.
32416154,Since December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a major epidemic threat in China and later spread worldwide.
32416154,During the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, the Chinese Obstetricians and Gynecologists Association (COGA) distributed guidelines regarding care of gynecologic patients.
32416154,These guidelines were developed by the Obstetrics and Gynecology department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and represent an effort to integrate infection control strategy and promote professionalism in medical practice.
32416154,The guidelines represent collaboration with experts from 31 provinces and autonomous regions of mainland China over 2 weeks' time.
32416154,With the implementation of these guidelines no nosocomial infections of COVID-19 have been identified at PUMCH.
32416154,We think these guidelines might be helpful to departments of obstetrics and gynecology internationally during these unprecedented times.
32416154,In our guidelines, we describe basic infection precaution principles, an epidemiologic screening tool, prioritization of surgical procedures, and operating room requirements.
32416154,Using these principles, we then review management of gynecologic patients during the COVID-19 epidemic in the outpatient and operative and non-operative inpatient settings, as well as in clinical trials.
32416629,During severe inflammatory coronavirus infectious disease (CoVID-19) pandemic and based on evidence on COVID-19 epidemiology, patients with primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCLs) have risk for developing complicated COVID-19 infections in consideration of their older age (majority above 60) and their potential underlying predisposing conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes).<sup>1,2,3</sup> Moreover, PCL patients with aggressive biologic behavior should be carefully monitored according to guidelines for patients with neoplastic disease.
32416785,Concerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19; however, epidemiological evidence is lacking.
32416785,We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19.
32416785,In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020.
32416785,As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018).
32416785,We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls.
32416785,The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19.
32416785,To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs.
32416785,We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression.
32416785,The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437.
32416785,We collected data for 1139 cases and 11 390 population controls.
32416785,Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls.
32416785,Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15).
32416785,No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37).
32416785,Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80).
32416785,The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.
32416785,RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.
32416785,Instituto de Salud Carlos III.
32417117,Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, and specially in epidemiological surveillance.
32417117,The COVID19-Tracker web application systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain.
32417117,It collects automatically daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases and mortality, from February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2020 onwards.
32417117,Three applications have already been developed: 1) to analyze data trends and estimating short-term projections; 2) to estimate the case fatality rate; and 3) to assess the effect of the lockdowns on the data trends.
32417117,The application may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain.
32417555,Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak.
32417555,Sewage Epidemiology or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach has been successfully used to track and provide early warnings of outbreaks of pathogenic viruses such as Hepatitis A, Poliovirus and Norovirus.
32417555,In untreated wastewater COVID-19 (excreted via faeces then introduced to wastewater) can survive from hours to days.
32417555,Detection of COVID-19 can be carried out with nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, used for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe.
32417555,New cheaper and faster monitoring tools are being developed to detect Covid-19 in wastewater by biosensors, ELISA, or paper-based indicator methods.
32417555,This will allow to reveal true scale of Covid-19 outbreak associated with population link to a specific wastewater treatment plant.
32417709,The outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a respiratory disease and individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders display worse prognosis through the infection course.
32417709,The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2.
32417709,This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D.
32417709,Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir.
32417709,In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors.
32417709,Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry.
32417709,Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon.
32417709,Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.
32417709,Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.
32417996,To search for evidence base for using BCG in the fight against COVID-19 and the possible impact of these clinical trials on urology practice.
32417996,A literature review about the basis of the ongoing clinical trials using BCG against COVID-19, as well as the use of BCG in urology and if there are any implications of these trials on our practice.
32417996,Based on data from some epidemiological studies, there are some current clinical trials on the use BCG as a possible prophylactic vaccine against SARS CoV-2 which can affect urology practice.
32417996,Urologists are already struggling with the global shortage of BCG which can be even more aggravated by such trials.
32417996,In addition, if the ongoing trials proved the efficacy of BCG as a prophylaxis against COVID-19, this may open the door to more urological research opportunities to question the possibility that intra-vesical BCG, given its systemic immunologic effect, may have been protective to this subgroup of urological patients.
32417996,The ongoing clinical trials using BCG against COVID-19 can affect our urology practice.
32417996,We need to stay vigilant to such impacts: BCG shortage and possible new chances for urology research work.
32418194,As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, crowdsourced digital technology harbours the potential to improve surveillance and epidemic control, primarily through increased information coverage, higher information speed, fast case tracking and improved proximity tracing.
32418194,Targeting those aims, COVID-19-related smartphone and web-based health applications are continuously emerging, leading to a multitude of options, raising ethical and legal challenges and potentially overwhelming end users.
32418194,Building on an existing trustworthiness checklist for digital health applications, we searched the literature and developed a framework to guide the assessment of smartphone and web-based applications that aim to contribute to controlling the current epidemic or mitigating its effects.
32418194,It further integrates epidemiological subject knowledge and a legal analysis, outlining the mechanisms through which new applications can support the fight against COVID-19.
32418194,The resulting framework includes 40 questions across 8 domains on &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;usability&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;information accuracy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;organisational attributes / reputation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;transparency&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;privacy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;user control / self-determination&amp;rdquo;.
32418194,All questions should be primarily answerable from publicly available data, as provided by application manufacturers.
32418194,The framework aims to guide end users in choosing a transparent, safe and valuable application and suggests a set of information items that developers ideally make available to allow a balanced judgement and facilitate the trustworthiness of their products.
32418508,An error in data processing resulted in the tabulation of incorrect crude case fatality rate values, for age groups of 50-59 and above, in Table 5 (Crude Case Fatality Rate of all cases and hospitalised cases, by age group) as originally published in the COVID-19 (Australia) epidemiology report 14.
32418508,The table below provides the corrected values.
32418549,In December, 2019, an infection outbreak occurred in Wuhan of unknown cause, which attracts intense attention.
32418549,Shortly after the virus was identified with the name of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out and an information storm occurred.
32418549,At that time, two important aspects: the stage and the links of epidemic, were unclear.
32418549,Answers to the questions, what are the sources, how do infections occur, and who will be affected should be clarified as the outbreak continues to evolve.
32418549,Furthermore, the epidemic process and the stage of epidemic should be explored and discussed.
32418549,Based on information of SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome(MERS) and COVID-19, the links of epidemic (the sources, the routes of infection, and the susceptible population) will be discussed as well as the role of the natural and the social factors.
32418549,Epidemiology characteristics of patients will be traced based on current information.
32418559,Back-projection is an epidemiological analysis method that was developed to estimate HIV incidence using surveillance data on AIDS diagnoses.
32418559,It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts.
32418559,Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period.
32418559,This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia.
32418559,It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns.
32418559,For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels.
32418559,These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures.
32418559,It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections.
32418559,Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed.
32418559,Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.
32418728,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an optional prescription status that has resulted in frequent use, in particular for the symptomatic treatment of fever and non-rheumatic pain.
32418728,In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections.
32418728,First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic.
32418728,Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk.
32418728,Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on Streptococcus pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy).
32418728,Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication.
32418728,Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate.
32418728,In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
32419272,The pandemic outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread all over the world in a short period of time.
32419272,Efficient identification of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the most important tasks to facilitate all the following counter measurements in dealing with the infectious disease.
32419272,In Taiwan, a COVID-19 Open Science Platform adheres to the spirit of open science: sharing sources, data, and methods to promote progress in academic research while corroborating findings from various disciplines has established in mid-February 2020, for collaborative research in support of the development of detection methods, therapeutics, and a vaccine for COVID-19.
32419272,Research priorities include infection control, epidemiology, clinical characterization and management, detection methods (including viral RNA detection, viral antigen detection, and serum antibody detection), therapeutics (neutralizing antibody and small molecule drugs), vaccines, and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
32419272,In addition, research on social ethics and the law are included to take full account of the impact of the COVID-19 virus.
32419771,In January 2020, the Chinese authorities confirmed the causative agent of an outbreak of cases with pneumonia of unknown etiology that appeared in December 2019.
32419771,The World Health Organization (WHO) called COVID-19 is a new virus of the coronavirus family.
32419771,On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide.
32419771,Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed.
32419771,The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations.
32419771,In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death.
32419771,SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects.
32419771,In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility.
32419771,These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak.
32420305,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become an immense public health burden, first in China and subsequently worldwide.
32420305,Developing effective control measures for COVID-19, especially measures that can halt the worsening of severe cases to a critical status is of urgent importance.
32420305,A 52-year-old woman presented with a high fever (38.8 °C), chills, dizziness, and weakness.
32420305,Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster.
32420305,A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (60.6 ± 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 ± 1.34% lymphocytes).
32420305,Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes.
32420305,Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19.
32420305,Following treatment with early non-invasive ventilation and a bundle pharmacotherapy, she recovered with a good outcome.
32420305,Early non-invasive ventilation with a bundle pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment regimen for the broader population of patients with COVID-19.
32420674,The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2019), reminiscent of the 2002-SARS-CoV outbreak, has completely isolated countries, disrupted health systems and partially paralyzed international trade and travel.
32420674,In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time.
32420674,This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations.
32420674,Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures.
32420674,Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side.
32420777,<b>Introduction:</b> With the emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries, medical resources currently focus on the treatment of confirmed patients and screening of suspected cases.
32420777,Asymptomatic patients may be contagious, which makes epidemic control difficult.
32420777,We describe an asymptomatic patient with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in urine.<b>Case report:</b> An asymptomatic girl was identified during the epidemiological investigation of a confirmed COVID-19 patient.
32420777,When admitted to the hospital on 24 February 2020, she had no clinical manifestations.
32420777,A throat swab was negative for RT-PCR, but urine was positive.
32420777,She was given antiviral and symptomatic supportive treatment.
32420777,On 26 February, a throat swab RT-PCR was positive.
32420777,RT-PCR in throat swabs and urine were negative on 3 and 5 March, and on 9 and 12 March, throat swabs were still negative.
32420777,At follow-up on 26 March, she felt well, throat swab RT-PCR was negative, and isolation was lifted.<b>Conclusion:</b> The urine of asymptomatic patients may be contagious.
32420777,RT-PCR in urine might be a useful supplement in screening when the RT-PCR is negative in throat swabs.
32420935,One of WHO primary function is to control and monitor internationally the spread of infectious diseases of the common killers.
32420935,After SARS-COV, the International Health Regulations (IHR) was adopted in 2005 by all 194 member states to set up national preparedness for an efficient &quot;early alert and response system&quot;.
32420935,COVID-19 is a novel virus with an unpredictable course and many uncertainties about its biological, clinical and epidemiological characteristics.
32420935,COVID-19 is a game changer and calls for a revision of IHR as well as a more biological, clinical and community-cantered preparedness strategy.
32420937,Laboratory medicine provides an almost irreplaceable contribution to the diagnostic reasoning and managed care of most human pathologies.
32420937,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm.
32420937,Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed.
32420937,First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels.
32420937,The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.
32420937,Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far.
32420937,As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.
32420937,Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis.
32420937,The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.
32420941,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32420941,Its outbreak in many states of the world, forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic.
32420941,Currently, COVID-19 has infected 1 991 562 patients causing 130 885 deaths globally as of 16 April 2020.
32420941,The aim of this review is to underline the epidemiological, clinical and management characteristics in children affected by COVID-19.
32420941,We searched Pubmed, from January to April 2020, for the following search terms: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;children&quot;, &quot;SARS-COV2&quot;, &quot;complications&quot;, &quot;epidemiology&quot;, &quot;clinical features&quot;, focusing our attention mostly on epidemiology and symptoms of COVID-19 in children.
32420941,Usually, infants and children present milder symptoms of the disease with a better outcome than adults.
32420941,Consequently, children may be considered an infection reservoir that may play a role as spreader of the infection in community.
32420943,The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is defined as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32420943,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, fatigue, cough, breathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory distress; a small population of patients may have diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
32420943,The highest infection rate occurs in adults; however, neonates, children, and adolescents can also be infected.
32420943,As the outbreak continues to spread worldwide, attention has switched toward determinants of clinical manifes- tations and disease severity.
32420943,The situation surrounding the outbreak is rapidly evolving and the information and recommendations are changing as new information becomes available.
32420943,This paper summarises the cur- rent findings (April 3,2020) from a systematic literature review on the current knowledge of COVID-19 in adolescents (10-19 years according to the WHO definition) and reports the preliminary epidemiological data stated by the Italian National Institute of Health.
32420953,The ongoing 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an enormous challenge for the health systems and the entire societies of the countries involved.
32420953,Since at present the outbreak continues to evolve (April 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern, specifying that public health interventions aimed at the prevention of the further spread of this disease include quarantine.
32420953,Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in the history of mankind.
32420953,The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint.
32420953,One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread.
32420953,With specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still adopt &quot;classical&quot; preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease.
32420953,Only the future will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic.
32420953,However, what in this epidemiological scenario is already known, is that the multi-century international health value of quarantine remains essential and unavoidable.
32421292,The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients.
32421292,The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age.
32421292,These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe.
32421292,Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article.
32421292,The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older.
32421292,The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index ≥40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment.
32421292,Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions.
32421292,While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million.
32421292,That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots.
32421292,For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy.
32421292,The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19?
32421292,(2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made?
32421292,(3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been?
32421292,and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus?
32421292,The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy.
32421292,Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward.
32421292,The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to &quot;shelter in place,&quot; quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals.
32421292,The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it.
32421292,However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy.
32421292,Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity.
32421292,Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population.
32421292,Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year.
32421292,Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.
32422057,Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are being used to &quot;rule out&quot; infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers.
32422057,It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results.
32422057,To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection.
32422057,Literature review and pooled analysis. 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (<i>n</i> = 1330).
32422057,A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32422057,A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset.
32422057,Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4.
32422057,On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%).
32422057,This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21.
32422057,Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based.
32422057,Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission.
32422057,If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

32422201,In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia.
32422201,WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
32422201,An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.
32422201,A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR.
32422201,Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts).
32422201,High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms.
32422201,We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms.
32422201,Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods.
32422201,Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.
32422201,Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations.
32422201,Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4.
32422201,The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3-4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0-5·0).
32422201,Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown.
32422201,One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase.
32422201,Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0-99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2-32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6-8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.
32422201,Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.
32422201,Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred.
32422201,These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

32422983,The current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, which started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, is an ongoing challenge and a significant threat to public health requiring surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand a new, emergent, and unknown pathogen and to develop effective therapies.
32422983,Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident.
32422983,Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools.
32422983,A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;nCov 19&quot;, and &quot;Sars Cov 2&quot;. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: &quot;death&quot;, &quot;died&quot;, &quot;comorbidity&quot;, &quot;cause of death&quot;, &quot;biopsy&quot;, &quot;autopsy&quot;, or &quot;pathological&quot;.
32422983,A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria.
32422983,However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data.
32422983,The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%).
32422983,Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies.
32422983,The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer.
32422983,The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock.
32422983,Only 7 papers reported histological investigations.
32422983,Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them.
32422983,The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection.
32422983,Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients.
32422983,As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary.
32422983,Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32423024,On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic.
32423024,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world.
32423024,COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies.
32423024,There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32423024,However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence.
32423024,Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies.
32423024,Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32423024,Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies.
32423024,This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32423024,All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.
32423094,In December 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in the city of Wuhan, China.
32423094,Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions.
32423094,High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events.
32423094,At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs.
32423094,In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females.
32423094,Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died.
32423094,On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons.
32423094,Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered.
32423094,Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the <i>ACE2</i> gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous.
32423094,Secondly, the higher <i>ACE2</i> expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data.
32423094,Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.
32423094,Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., <i>ABO</i> locus, <i>SRY</i>, <i>SOX3, ADAM17</i>).
32423094,Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death.
32423094,Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32423435,Recently, the World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
32423435,So far, however, limited data are available for children.
32423435,Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children.
32423435,From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected.
32423435,The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated.
32423435,Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side.
32423435,Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type.
32423435,Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes.
32423435,One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins.
32423435,The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various.
32423435,Accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT imaging data.
32424745,A recent outbreak of a novel Coronavirus responsible for a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally.
32424745,The aim of this study was to systematically review main clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric age.
32424745,An electronic search was conducted in PubMed database.
32424745,Papers published between 1 January and 1 May 2020 including children aged 0-18 years were selected.
32424745,Sixty-two studies and three reviews were included, with a total sample size of 7480 children (2428/4660 males, 52.1%; weighted mean age 7.6 years).
32424745,Patients showed mainly mild (608/1432, 42.5%) and moderate (567/1432, 39.6%) signs of the infection.
32424745,About 2% of children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.
32424745,The most commonly described symptoms were fever (51.6%) and cough (47.3%).
32424745,Laboratory findings were often unremarkable.
32424745,Children underwent a chest CT scan in 73.9% of all cases, and 32.7% resulted normal.
32424745,Overall, the estimated mortality was 0.08%.
32424745,A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%).
32424745,Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults.
32424745,Laboratory and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific.
32424745,Larger epidemiological and clinical cohort studies are needed to better understand possible implications of COVID-19 infection in children.What is Known:• A novel Coronavirus has been recently identified as responsible for a new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) spreading globally.
32424745,• There is limited evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection in children.What is New:• Systematically reviewed available evidence showed that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a less severe pattern of disease in comparison to adults.
32424745,• Blood tests and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific in children but may help to identify those who are severely ill.
32425000,Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
32425000,By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32425000,COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement.
32425000,SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection.
32425000,Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact.
32425000,Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic.
32425000,Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development.
32425000,This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.
32425000,We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic.
32425002,A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in Wuhan, China, has been rapidly spreading around the world.
32425002,This study investigates the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Zhejiang Province who did or did not have a history of Wuhan exposure.
32425002,We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan.
32425002,Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.19±16.13) years vs.
32425002,(43.47±13.12) years, P&lt;0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs.
32425002,5.60% exposure, P&lt;0.001).
32425002,The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs.
32425002,18.66%, P&lt;0.001).
32425002,The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs.
32425002,10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs.
32425002,12.15%, P=0.015).
32425002,More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group.
32425002,There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups.
32425002,From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history.
32425224,The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an enormous challenge.
32425224,Given the considerable presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the current population, the pandemic is a health issue that requires an effort to provide better responses to our patients who are more vulnerable to the onset of infection and who are candidates for presenting more severe symptoms.
32425224,This document attempts to address the relationship between COVID-19 infection and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
32425224,To this end, we will briefly analyse whether the epidemiological data support this association and, subsequently, go in depth on the pathophysiological mechanisms that might connect the two diseases.
32425234,The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown.
32425234,We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes.
32425234,Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19.
32425234,We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and utilized multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men).
32425234,Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate).
32425234,SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively.
32425234,Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), ≥2 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7).
32425234,TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2).
32425234,Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established.
32425234,Notably, TNF antagonists do not appear to be associated with severe COVID-19.
32425279,Discovered in 2017, swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), also known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) or porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), is the fifth porcine CoV identified in diarrheal piglets.
32425279,The presumed name &quot;SADS-CoV&quot; may not be appropriate since current studies have not provided strong evidence for high pathogenicity of the virus.
32425279,SeACoV was the most recently recognized CoV of potential bat origin prior to the novel human severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), associated with the pandemic CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32425279,Although SeACoV is recognized as a regional epizootic virus currently, it possesses the most extensive cell species tropism in vitro among known CoVs.
32425279,This review summarizes the emergence of SeACoV and updates the research progress made from 2017 to early 2020, mainly focusing on the etiology, epidemiology, evolutionary perspective, potential for interspecies transmission, pathogenesis and diagnosis.
32425491,In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China.
32425491,Days later, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus.
32425491,This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces was named COVID-19.
32425491,The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector.
32425491,Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic.
32425491,The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.
32425651,COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to manifest with severe acute respiratory syndrome among the adults, however, it offers a convincing indication of less severity and fatality in pediatric age group (0-18 years).
32425651,The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
32425651,According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22<sup>nd</sup> March (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).
32425651,However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available.
32425651,Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.
32425653,Despite its current relatively low global share of cases and deaths in Africa compared to other regions, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has the potential to trigger other larger crises in the region.
32425653,This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria.
32425653,Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa.
32425653,We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature.
32425653,Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa.
32425653,There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases.
32425653,This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility.
32425653,Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed.
32425653,With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities.
32425653,Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children.
32425653,This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region.
32425653,COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.
32426285,Italy is the European country that was hit first and hardest by the COVID-19 epidemic.
32426285,Since February 2020, the outbreak of the epidemic disease in Italy, with fatal outcomes in up to 10% of cases, made it urgent to implement extraordinary measures to avoid a breakdown of the universal Italian national health system.
32426285,The update for April 1, 2020, in Italy recorded 102,669 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with a median patient age of 63 years.
32426285,The deceased patients were older people (median age 80 years) and often had a cancer diagnosis (about 20%).
32426285,Thus, in the extraordinary epidemiological scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, older persons in cancer treatment are at particularly high risk of being severely affected by COVID-19.
32426285,These people face a health- and economics-related emergency that also carries cultural and ethical implications.
32426285,In accordance with the measures adopted by the Italian government to limit viral transmission, several associations of Italian oncologists have taken action to update Elderly Cancer Care programs.
32426285,In view of the newly emerging needs, we herein outline practical suggestions aimed at guaranteeing the best continuity to elderly cancer patients.
32426441,Relying on capacity increases and patient transfers to deal with the huge and continuous inflow of COVID-19 critically ill patients is a strategy limited by finite human and logistical resources.
32426441,Prioritising both critical care initiation and continuation is paramount to save the greatest number of lives.
32426441,It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them.
32426441,It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity.
32426441,Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients.
32426441,Prioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level A) or saturation (level B).
32426441,Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: P1 - high priority, P2 - intermediate priority, P3 - not needed, P4 - not appropriate.
32426441,Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient's wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition.
32426441,Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48 h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease's natural history (ICU days 7 to 10 for COVID-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change.
32426441,For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount.
32426441,Prioritisation strategy is bound to evolve with new knowledge and with changes within the epidemiological situation.
32426529,The shelter-in-place order for Santa Clara County, California on 16 March was the first of its kind in the USA.
32426529,It was unknown what impact this order would have on trauma activations.
32426529,We performed a retrospective analysis of institutional trauma registries among the two American College of Surgeons Level 1 trauma centers serving Santa Clara County, California.
32426529,Trauma activation volumes at the trauma centers from January to March 2020 were compared with month-matched historical cohorts from 2018 to 2019.
32426529,Only 81 (3%) patients were trauma activations at the trauma centers in the 15 days after the shelter-in-place order went into effect on 16 March 2020, compared with 389 activations during the same time period in 2018 and 2019 (p&lt;0.0001).
32426529,There were no other statistically significant changes to the epidemiology of trauma activations.
32426529,Only one trauma activation had a positive COVID-19 test.
32426529,Overall trauma activations decreased 4.8-fold after the shelter-in-place order went into effect in Santa Clara County on 16 March 2020, with no other effect on the epidemiology of persons presenting after traumatic injury.
32426529,Shelter-in-place orders may reduce strain on healthcare systems by diminishing hospital admissions from trauma, in addition to reducing virus transmission.
32426754,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disproportionally strained intensive care services worldwide.
32426754,Large areas of uncertainly regarding epidemiology, physiology, practice patterns, and resource demands for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 require rapid collection and dissemination of data.
32426754,We describe the conception and implementation of an intensive care database rapidly developed and designed to meet data analytic needs in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-the multicenter, international Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study.
32426754,Prospective cohort study and disease registry.
32426754,Multinational cohort of ICUs.
32426754,Critically ill patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.
32426754,None.
32426754,Within 2 weeks of conception of the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study, study leadership was convened, registry case report forms were designed, electronic data entry set up, and more than 250 centers had submitted the protocol for institutional review board approval, with more than 100 cases entered.
32426754,The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study provides an example of a rapidly deployed, international, pandemic registry that seeks to provide near real-time analytics and information regarding intensive care treatments and outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
32426877,Melanoma epidemiology has shown a constant increase in the last few decades even if mortality is low and only a small percentage of patients develop metastatic disease.
32426877,For these patients, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) significantly improves disease outcome with a median survival more than 2 years.
32426877,The same drugs are used as adjuvant treatment in disease-free patients.
32426877,Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic disease with lung manifestations, which can bring severe acute respiratory distress.
32426877,The most important risk factors related to a higher death risk for COVID-19 pneumonia are elderly age and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, previous cancer).
32427166,One of the many questions with respect to controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic is whether existing drugs can be re-purposed (re-positioned) for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19 - or for any future epidemic.
32427166,The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials.
32427166,These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure.
32427166,Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment.
32427166,The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs.
32427166,These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests).
32427166,Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe).
32427166,By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression.
32427166,These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19.
32427166,Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.
32427170,Meteorological and geophysical hazards will concur and interact with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts in many regions on Earth.
32427170,These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems.
32427170,A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas).
32427170,In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations.
32427170,Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions.
32427170,For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities.
32427170,COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types).
32427170,A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards.
32427170,Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies.
32427170,Our recommendations may assist governments and their advisors to develop risk reduction strategies for natural and cascading hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32427202,Uncertainty around the role 'super-spreaders' play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition.
32427202,It is a term that has been much used in relation to COVID-19, particularly in social media.
32427202,On its widest definition, it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people.
32427202,Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others.
32427202,Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings.
32427202,This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic.
32427202,One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders.
32427202,Another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission.
32427202,The author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition.
32429774,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged health care systems and physicians worldwide to attempt to provide the best care to their patients with an evolving understanding of this unique pathogen.
32429774,This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19.
32429774,This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway.
32429774,What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke.
32429774,Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are also at higher risk for morbidity and mortality if infected.
32429774,These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients.In this paper, we review the current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging evidence for a wide range of cardiovascular disease states with special focus on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.
32429774,Our goal is to provide guidance for treatment of the cardiovascular patient with COVID-19 in the face of a rapidly evolving understanding of this virus and its complications.Preamble:Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies are a major cause of inpatient morbidity and mortality.
32429774,This is amplified in critically ill patients.
32429774,COVID-19 patients present special challenges due to rapidly changing clinical status.
32429774,In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients.
32429774,The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology.
32429774,Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations.
32429774,Our deliberations and treatment recommendations are summarized here.Objective:To provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
32430651,SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a spike protein allowing viral binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which acts as a viral receptor and is expressed on the surface of several pulmonary and extra-pulmonary cell types, including cardiac, renal, intestinal and endothelial cells.
32430651,There is evidence that also endothelial cells are infected by SARS-COV-2, with subsequent occurrence of systemic vasculitis, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32430651,Those effects, together with the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; are involved in a worse prognosis.
32430651,In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
32430651,In in vivo studies, ACE-Is and ARBs seem to paradoxically increase ACE-2 expression, which could favour SARS-CoV-2 infection of host's cells and tissues.
32430651,By contrast, in patients treated with ACE-Is and ARBs, ACE-2 shows a downregulation at the mRNA and protein levels in kidney and cardiac tissues.
32430651,Yet, it has been claimed that both ARBs and ACE-Is could result potentially useful in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
32430651,As detected in China and as the Italian epidemiological situation confirms, the most prevalent comorbidities in deceased patients with COVID-19 are hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
32430651,Older COVID-19-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or ACE-Is.
32430651,Another confounding factor is cigarette smoking, which has been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in both experimental models and humans.
32430651,Sex also plays a role, with chromosome X harbouring the gene coding for ACE-2, which is one of the possible explanations of why mortality in female patients is lower.
32430651,Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, an androgen dependent enzyme.
32430651,Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies.
32430651,We claim the need of adequately powered, prospective studies aimed at answering the following questions of paramount importance for cardiovascular, internal and emergency medicine: Do ACE-Is and ARBs exert similar or different effects on infection or disease course?
32430651,Are such effects dangerous, neutral or even useful in older, COVID-19-affected patients?
32430651,Do they act on multiple cell types?
32430651,Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.
32430651,At present, insufficient detailed data from trials have been made available.
32431961,The world is currently witnessing a dramatic disruption of everyday life owing to the rapid progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32431961,As the pandemic evolves, there is an urgent need to better understand its epidemiology, characterize its potential impact, and identify mitigatory strategies to avert pandemic-related mortality.
32431961,There is a need for a tool or algorithm to evaluate the extent to which public health policy and/or economic preparedness measures are effectively averting COVID-19 related mortality.
32431961,We present a simple and yet practical epidemiological tool, the Pandemic Efficiency Index (PEI), that can be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from COVID-19 infection.
32431961,Using the PEI and current COVID-19-related mortality, we determined that so far Germany demonstrates the highest PEI (5.1) among countries with more than 5,000 recorded cases of the infection, indicating high quality measures instituted by the country to avert death during the pandemic.
32431961,Italy and France currently have the lowest COVID-19-related PEIs.
32431961,Epidemics and pandemics come and go, but local, national, and global abilities to determine the efficiency of their efforts in averting deaths is critical.
32432121,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical characteristics and dynamic follow-up changes of high resolution CT (HRCT) in 270 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 146 males and 124 females, with median age of 51 (9,89).
32432121,The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive.
32432121,According to the number of lung segments involved in the lesion, the lesions range from &lt;30% of the lung area (Common type), 30-50% (Severe type), and&gt; 50% (Critical type).
32432121,At the first CT exam, 136 cases (50.37%) of the common type, 89 cases (32.96%) of the severe type and 45 cases (16.67%) of the critical type.
32432121,At the second CT exam, 84 cases (31.11%) of the common type, 103 cases (38.15%) of the severe type and 83 cases (30.74%) of the critical type.
32432121,In the third CT exam, there were 151 cases (55.93%) of the common type, 86 cases (31.85%) of the severe type and 33 cases (12.22%) of the critical type.
32432121,The differences in image typing were statistically significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
32432121,During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.
32433217,Approximately 3 billion people around the world have gone into some form of social separation to mitigate the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32433217,The uncontrolled influx of patients in need of emergency care has rapidly brought several national health systems to near-collapse with deadly consequences to those afflicted by COVID-19 and other critical diseases associated with COVID-19.
32433217,Solid scientific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 remains scarce; there is an urgent need to expand our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology to facilitate precise and targeted treatments.
32433217,The capacity for rapid information dissemination has emerged as a double-edged sword; the existing gap of high-quality data is frequently filled by anecdotal reports, contradictory statements and misinformation.
32433217,This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity.
32433217,Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
32433217,The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
32433217,Furthermore, solutions for enhancing international strategies in translational research, cooperative networks and regulatory partnerships are contemplated.
32433260,During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures to encourage social distancing have been implemented, including cancellation of school and organized sports.
32433260,A resulting change in pediatric fracture epidemiology is expected.
32433260,This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fracture incidence and characteristics.
32433260,This is a retrospective cohort study comparing acute fractures presenting to a single level I pediatric trauma hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic with fractures during a prepandemic period at the same institution.
32433260,The &quot;pandemic&quot; cohort was gathered from March 15 to April 15, 2020 and compared with a &quot;prepandemic&quot; cohort from the same time window in 2018 and 2019.
32433260,In total, 1745 patients presenting with acute fractures were included.
32433260,There was a significant decrease in the incidence of fractures presenting to our practice during the pandemic (22.5±9.1/d vs.
32433260,9.6±5.1/d, P&lt;0.001).
32433260,The presenting age for all fractures decreased during the pandemic (7.5±4.3 vs.
32433260,9.4±4.4 y, P&lt;0.001) because of decreased fracture burden among adolescents.
32433260,There were also a decrease in the number of fractures requiring surgery (2.2±1.8/d vs.
32433260,0.8±0.8/d, P&lt;0.001).
32433260,During the pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at home (57.8% vs.
32433260,32.5%, P&lt;0.001) or on bicycles (18.3% vs.
32433260,8.2%, P&lt;0.001), but a decrease in those related to sports (7.2% vs.
32433260,26.0%, P&lt;0.001) or playgrounds (5.2% vs.
32433260,9.0%, P&lt;0.001).
32433260,There was no increase in time-to-presentation.
32433260,Patients with distal radius torus fractures were more likely to receive a velcro splint during the pandemic (44.2% vs.
32433260,25.9%, P=0.010).
32433260,Pediatric fracture volume has decreased 2.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of cessation of organized sports and decreased playground use.
32433260,In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas.
32433260,Given the rising proportion of bicycling injuries, an emphasis on basic safety precautions could improve public health.
32433260,An observed increase in the prescription of velcro splints for distal radius fractures highlights an opportunity for simplified patient care during the pandemic.
32433260,Level III.
32434058,In order to benefit the public, community workers and scientific community, we hereby present a chronicle of SARS-CoV-2 that leads to the unseen precedent of social distancing and lockdown owing to coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32434058,Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic.
32434058,Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
32434058,We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses.
32434058,The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management.
32434058,We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.
32434058,We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.
32434211,In December 2019, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China<sup>1</sup> and soon spread across the world.
32434211,In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of its epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis.
32434211,Here we analyzed the clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai.
32434211,Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 assembled from 112 quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) showed a stable evolution and suggested two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan.
32434211,Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes.
32434211,Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression.
32434211,High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count.
32434211,The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes.
32434402,The current ongoing pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has globally affected 213 countries and territories with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases and thousands of casualties.
32434402,The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level.
32434402,Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.
32434402,This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans.
32434402,Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed.
32434402,COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world.
32434402,Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32434633,To study the clinical and epidemiological features of children with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32434633,The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed.
32434633,Among the 20 children, there were 7 boys (35%) and 13 girls (65%), aged 8 months to 14 years (mean 8±5 years).
32434633,All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2.
32434633,Nineteen children were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32434633,Nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in all 20 children.
32434633,There were 4 children (20%) of mild type, 16 children (80%) of common type, and no children of severe type or critical type.
32434633,The mean peripheral blood leukocyte count was (6.8±3.5)×10<sup>9</sup>/L, and 7 children had an abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count, with an increase in 5 children and a reduction in 2 children.
32434633,One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×10<sup>9</sup>/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (&gt;400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (&gt;1.6 mmol/L).
32434633,Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children.
32434633,Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation.
32434633,Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests.
32434633,Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.
32434634,To study the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged &lt;18 years.
32434634,A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020.
32434634,Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation.
32434634,Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type.
32434634,Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs.
32434634,The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days).
32434634,Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer.
32434634,Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
32434634,All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered.
32434634,COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results.
32434634,Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.
32434634,Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years.
32435268,Europe is now the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32435268,Many concerns have arisen about the management and treatment of children with cancer while researchers are wondering how to deal with this devastating pandemic.
32435268,In view of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is fundamental to stress that the behavior and hygiene rules adopted by children with cancer must be respected and implemented in order to continue to safeguard their health for the current pandemic.
32436101,While the epidemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, more and more evidences are collected about the presence of neurological manifestations and symptoms associated with it.
32436101,A systematic review has been performed of papers published until 5 April 2020. 29 papers related to neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were examined.
32436101,The results show presence of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations related to coronavirus.
32436101,Neurological manifestations, or NeuroCOVID, are part of the COVID-19 clinical picture, but questions remain regarding the frequency and severity of CNS symptoms, the mechanism of action underlying neurological symptoms, and the relationship of symptoms with the course and severity of COVID-19.
32436101,Further clinical, epidemiological, and basic science research is urgently needed to understand and address neurological sequalae of COVID-19.
32436101,Concomitant risk factors or determinants (e.g. demographic factors, comorbidities, or available biomarkers) that may predispose a person with COVID-19 to neurological manifestations also need to be identified.
32436101,The review shows that although more and more papers are reporting neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19; however, many items remain unclear and this uncertainty calls for a global action that requires close coordination and open-data sharing between hospitals, academic institutions and the fast establishment of harmonised research priorities and research consortia to face the NeuroCOVID-19 complications.
32436355,The pandemic of new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has stressed the importance of effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of clinical worsening and mortality.
32436355,Epidemiological data showing a differential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on women and men has suggested a potential role for testosterone (T) in determining gender-disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes.
32436355,To estimate the association between T level and SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes (defined as conditions requiring transfer to higher or lower intensity of care or death) in a cohort of patients admitted in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 31 male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and recovered in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the &quot;Carlo Poma&quot; Hospital in Mantua were analyzed.
32436355,Several biochemical risk factors (i.e., blood count and leucocyte formula, C- Reactive Protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), Lactic Dehydrogenase (LDH), Ferritin, D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, Interleukin 6 (IL-6)) as well as total testosterone (TT), calculated free T (cFT), Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) were determined.
32436355,Lower TT and cFT were found in the transferred to ICU/deceased in RICU group vs. groups of patients transferred to IM or maintained in the RICU in stable condition.
32436355,Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (i.e. the neutrophil count, LDH and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count.
32436355,Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels.
32436355,A steep increase of both ICU transfer or mortality risk was observed in men with TT&lt;5 nmol/L or cFT&lt; 100 pmol/L.
32436355,Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected men admitted to RICU.
32437003,Italy was the second nation after China to be most involved into the COVID-19 outbreak.
32437003,From the beginning, much attention has been attributed to the importance of epidemiological criteria (such as previous contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases, recent journey across China or the northern Italian regions) in order to assess a suspected patient for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32437003,Despite this, by now evidences do exist about the possibly huge reservoir of asymptomatic patients and its underestimated ability to spread the infection.
32437003,Thus, we do believe that when an infectious disease has a big ratio of asymptomatic cases, as for COVID-19, it is simply not safe to rely on epidemiological criteria and we briefly discuss this issue throughout the few new evidences there are about.

32437017,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, a series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
32437017,We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of all confirmed cases in Qinghai, a province at high altitude.
32437017,The region had no sustained local transmission.
32437017,Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising 4 transmission clusters were identified.
32437017,Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan.
32437017,Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 2 patients showed no abnormalities.
32437017,Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases or diabetes developed severe illness.
32437017,High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both ALT and AST were observed in 3 severely ill patients on admission.
32437017,All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies.
32437017,Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters.
32437017,Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness.

32437033,To investigate olfactory dysfunction (OD) in patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through patient-reported outcome questionnaires and objective psychophysical testing.
32437033,COVID-19 patients with self-reported sudden-onset OD were recruited.
32437033,Epidemiological and clinical data were collected.
32437033,Nasal complaints were evaluated with the sinonasal outcome-22.
32437033,Subjective olfactory and gustatory status was evaluated with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
32437033,Objective OD was evaluated using psychophysical tests.
32437033,Eighty-six patients completed the study.
32437033,The most common symptoms were fatigue (72.9%), headache (60.0%), nasal obstruction (58.6%), and postnasal drip (48.6%).
32437033,Total loss of smell was self-reported by 61.4% of patients.
32437033,Objective olfactory testings identified 41 anosmic (47.7%), 12 hyposmic (14.0%), and 33 normosmic (38.3%) patients.
32437033,There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip.
32437033,A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients reporting OD do not have OD on objective testing.
32437575,Health care workers (HCWs) have high infection risk owing to treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32437575,However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited.
32437575,To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures.
32437575,This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China.
32437575,Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020.
32437575,Confirmed COVID-19.
32437575,Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire.
32437575,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records.
32437575,A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population.
32437575,Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected.
32437575,Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%.
32437575,Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years.
32437575,Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs.
32437575,A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected.
32437575,Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P &lt; .001).
32437575,The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs.
32437575,No environmental surfaces tested positive.
32437575,Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had nonsevere disease, while 1 (0.9%) died.
32437575,The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]).
32437575,Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs.
32437575,In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak.
32437575,That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics.
32437575,Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.
32437754,In the absence of widespread testing, syndromic surveillance approaches may be useful for understanding potential undocumented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States.
32437754,We used publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention FluView Interactive to evaluate its potential for COVID-19 syndromic surveillance.
32437754,Unlike the prior 3 influenza seasons, we found a 76% decrease in influenza positive tests and a 27% increase in influenza like illness during the weeks since COVID-19 outbreaks began in the United States, which suggests FluView's potential utility for COVID-19 syndromic surveillance.
32438005,Mexico declared the first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in February 2020.
32438005,At the time we write this article, our country is facing a community spread phase, expecting a rapid increase in the number of cases and fatalities.
32438005,The Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara has been declared a non-COVID-19 hospital with the mission of providing care to patients already registered and also those transferred from neurosurgical departments of neighboring centers, which have been converted into COVID-19 only hospitals.
32438005,An organized response regarding personnel, surgical case selection, operating room behavior, and facility reorganization were designed to prevent an internal coronavirus outbreak in the neurosurgery department at the Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara.
32438005,Distancing actions by the staff and residents, including ward case discussions, neurosurgery rounds, and classes, will be carried out virtually.
32438005,We classified neurosurgical patients into 4 groups depending on whether their condition demands care in 0-6 hours, 6-48 hours, 48 hours to 14 days, and &gt;14 days.
32438005,Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility.
32438005,Despite not being a COVID-19 center, we consider all patients at the neurosurgical ward and staff members as asymptomatic carriers or infected in the preclinical period.
32438005,Specific measures must be taken to ensure the safety and care of neurosurgical patients and medical staff during the community spread phase.
32438579,There were some family infections of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Taiwan to date.
32438579,This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of different types of family infections with COVID-19 and to share Taiwan's experience.
32438579,We collected cases of family infections of COVID-19 from 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020.
32438579,The data were collected from a series of press conference contents by Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).
32438579,During this period, there were six family infections in Taiwan, including two couple infections, one imported family cluster infection, and three domestic family cluster infections.
32438579,Compared to the former two, the starters (cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed longer symptom-onset to diagnosis (<i>p</i> = 0.02); longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation (<i>p</i> = 0.01); higher first-generation reproduction number (<i>p</i> = 0.03); and more critical presentation (endotracheal tube insertion and intensive care unit (ICU) care) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).
32438579,In addition, compared to the former two, the starters of the latter were older, had no history of travel, and had more underlying diseases and more mortality.
32438579,There are more contacts of domestic family cluster infections, making epidemiological investigations more difficult and expensive.
32438579,However, the second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero.
32438579,Domestic family cluster infections of COVID-19 have different characteristics and outcomes from couple infection and imported family cluster infections in this study.
32438622,The novel Coronavirus 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has surprised health authorities around the world, quickly producing a global health crisis.
32438622,Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
32438622,In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat.
32438622,In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications.
32438876,The recent outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, PR China, was caused by a novel beta coronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
32438876,To summarize chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the early stage of COVID-19 infection and provide a piece of reliable imaging evidence for initial screening and diagnosis.
32438876,From 10 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, we continuously observed chest CT imaging of 14 patients with clinically suspected new coronavirus infection in the two weeks after onset of symptoms.
32438876,Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, reticular pattern, and ground-glass mimic nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded.
32438876,We enrolled 14 patients, of which nine patients had the infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32438876,Five patients were highly suspected of infection.
32438876,All cases had epidemiological evidence.
32438876,GGO was a dominant imaging manifestation in the initial days of infection.
32438876,GGO performance accounts for 40% in 1- 2 days, 90% in 3- 6 days, and 85% in 7- 10 days.
32438876,With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT.
32438876,Consolidation performance accounts for 0% in 1- 2 days, 40% in 3- 6 days, and 71% in 7- 10 days.
32438876,The lesions are mostly near the pleura.
32438876,The number of lesions and the extent of the lesions increased as the disease progressed.
32438876,Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia have characteristic CT features in the initial stage of infection, which can be used as an essential supplement for nucleic acid examination.
32439651,Chest CT may be used as a tool for rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection.
32439651,Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region.
32439651,Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (<i>n</i> = 21) or head trauma (<i>n</i> = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region.
32439651,Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated.
32439651,Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (<i>n</i> = 11), brain contusion (<i>n</i> = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (<i>n</i> = 2), brain metastasis (<i>n</i> = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (<i>n</i> = 8).
32439651,Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients.
32439651,Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection.
32439651,Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative.
32439651,Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%.
32439651,The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high.
32439651,However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19.
32439651,The positive predictive value is poor.
32439651,Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.
32440887,The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is the worst healthcare emergency of this century, and its impact on pediatrics and neonatology is still largely unknown.
32440887,The European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) launched the EPICENTRE (ESPNIC Covid pEdiatric Neonatal Registry) international, multicenter, and multidisciplinary initiative to study the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32440887,EPICENTRE background and aims are presented together with protocol details.
32440887,EPICENTRE is open to centers all over the world, and this will allow to provide a pragmatic picture of the epidemic, with a particular attention to pediatric and neonatal critical care issues.Conclusions: EPICENTRE will allow researchers to clarify the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, refining its clinical management and hopefully providing new insights for clinicians.What is Known:• COVID19 is the new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is spreading around the globe.
32440887,• Majority of data available about SARS-CoV-2 infections originates from adult patients.What is New:• EPICENTRE is the first international, multicenter, multidisciplinary, meta-data driven, hospital-based, online, prospective cohort registry dedicated to neonatal and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32440887,• EPICENTRE will allow to understand epidemiology and physiopathology of COVID19.
32441548,BackgroundNorthern-Italy is one of the epicenters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) pandemic in Europe.
32441548,The impact of the pandemic and the consequent lockdown on medical emergencies other than those SARS-CoV2 related is largely unknown.
32441548,The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiologic impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic on hospital admission for severe emergent cardiovascular diseases (SECDs) in a single Northern Italy large tertiary referral center.
32441548,Methods and Results We quantified SECDs admissions to the Cardiology Division of Udine University Hospital between March 1<sup>st</sup> 2020 and March 31<sup>st</sup> 2020 and compared to those of the same time frame during 2019.
32441548,Compared to March 2019, we observed a significant reduction in all SECDs admissions: -30% for ST segment elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (STE-ACS), -66% for Non STE-ACS and -50% for severe bradyarrhythmia.
32441548,Conclusions A significant decrease in all SECDs admissions has been observed during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and was unlikely caused by a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases.
32441548,Fear of contagion may have contributed to the unpredictable drop of SECDs.
32441548,Social education about early recognition of symptoms of life-threatening cardiac conditions requiring appropriate care in a timely fashion may help to reduce this counter-productive phenomenon.
32441574,Since its outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province China, 2019-coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) had been widely spread all over the world, the control of which calls for a better understanding of its epidemiology and clinical characteristics.
32441574,We included 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University from 23 January 2020 to 11 February 2020, which were retrospectively analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features.
32441574,All the patients were confirmed by nucleic acid detection, the average age of whom was 45.25 years (range, 23-79 years).
32441574,Most patients had a history of Wuhan traveling or had contact with Wuhan travelers or infected cases.
32441574,Obvious family cluster was observed.
32441574,Clinical manifestations included fever (12/12), fatigue (10/12), cough (6/12), sore throat (4/12), headache (3/12), and diarrhea (2/12).
32441574,Only three out of eight patients had pneumonia manifestation on radiography.
32441574,Most patients had a normal white blood cell (WBC) count and normal or reduced lymphocyte (LY) count.
32441574,Pneumonia changes were observed in all the four patients who underwent a chest CT scan.
32441574,Only one elderly patient developed severe pneumonia, while all the rest were mild disease and had a self-limiting course.
32442210,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic of the human respiratory illness COVID-19, resulting in a severe threat to public health and safety.
32442210,Analysis of the genetic tree suggests that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same Betacoronavirus group as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
32442210,Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat.
32442210,The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
32442210,There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
32442210,Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32442265,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the coronavirus disease COVID-19) is highly transmissible among people.
32442265,Asymptomatic infections are also an important source of infection.
32442265,Here, we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32442265,We identified close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in northeast Chongqing who were RT-PCR+ yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections.
32442265,We stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest CT, and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors.
32442265,Between January and March, 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients.
32442265,Of these, 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings.
32442265,The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities.
32442265,Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days (range 1 to 29), and 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (p &lt; 0.05).
32442265,Nine subjects (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively.
32442265,The median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 13 days, compared to 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT (p &lt; 0.05).
32442265,A portion of these asymptomatic individuals, with and without abnormal chest CT scans, were capable of transmitting the virus to others.
32442265,Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential.
32442265,Studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.
32442528,Over 40 000 patients with COVID-19 have been hospitalised in New York City (NY, USA) as of April 28, 2020.
32442528,Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.
32442528,This prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan.
32442528,We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.
32442528,The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death.
32442528,Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.
32442528,The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.
32442528,Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.
32442528,Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill.
32442528,The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51-72), 171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%) patients had obesity.
32442528,As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.
32442528,The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6).
32442528,In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.
32442528,Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.
32442528,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.
32442720,The epidemic of pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its harm degree is defined as a global &quot;pandemic&quot;.
32442720,At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease.
32442720,The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing.
32442720,Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses.
32442720,Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures.
32442720,In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2.
32442720,This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19.
32442720,Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.
32442932,The first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Argentina was reported in Buenos Aires on March 3rd, 2020, in a patient who arrived from Milan.
32442932,The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and course of illness of patients infected with Covid-19 that were hospitalized in a private clinical setting during March 2020.
32442932,Sixty three patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, were admitted to our hospital during March 2020.
32442932,Twenty six of these subjects were diagnosed positive by the RT-PCR for SARS Cov-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen.
32442932,We recorded data about epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, in addition to comorbidities, laboratory and radiological studies were done.
32442932,The median age was 40 years (SD ± 15 years); there was an equal number of men and women; all the patients but one were coming from abroad; the most common symptom was fever (24/26 cases) and lymphopenia (n = 8).
32442932,We found that there were patients in whom fever disappeared within the first 72h (n = 17) and another group in which the fever lasted six or more days (n = 7).
32442932,One patient out of 26 died.
32442932,The population of our study was young and almost all were imported cases, in alinement with the stage of the epidemic at the time when the study was conducted.
32442932,We observed that there were two patterns in the fever curve but the persistence of it did not lead to a worse prognosis.
32442932,Larger population studies are required in order to confirm these clinical findings.
32442932,El primer caso de infección por coronavirus (COVID-19) en Argentina se informó en Buenos Aires el 3 de marzo de 2020, en un paciente proveniente de Milán.
32442932,El objetivo de este trabajo es describir las características clínicas y curso de la enfermedad de una serie de pacientes infectados con COVID-19 en un sanatorio privado durante el mes de marzo del 2020.
32442932,Durante marzo 2020 se internaron 63 pacientes sospechosos de infección por COVID-19.
32442932,Fueron diagnosticados 26 positivos para COVID-19 por hisopado nasofaríngeo, con el método RT-PCR para SARS Cov2.
32442932,Se recopilaron datos sobre las características epidemiológicas, signos y síntomas, así como comorbilidades, laboratorio e imágenes.
32442932,La edad promedio fue 40 años (SD ± 15 años); hubo un igual número de varones; solo 1 caso no venía del exterior.
32442932,El síntoma más frecuente fue la fiebre (24/26 casos) y la linfopenia (8/26).
32442932,En un grupo (n = 17) la fiebre se limitó dentro de las primeras 72 h y en otro, la fiebre duró 6 o más días (7 casos).
32442932,Hubo un fallecido entre los 26 casos.
32442932,La población de nuestro estudio era joven y la mayoría de los casos fueron importados, en concordancia con el estadio de la epidemia en el momento en que el estudio fue realizado.
32442932,Observamos que hubo 2 patrones en la curva térmica pero la persistencia de la fiebre no implicó un peor pronóstico.
32442932,Se necesitan estudios poblacionales más grandes para confirmar estos hallazgos clínicos.
32443640,We applied a generalized SEIR epidemiological model to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the world, with a focus on Italy and its Lombardy, Piedmont, and Veneto regions.
32443640,We focused on the application of a stochastic approach in fitting the model parameters using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solver, to improve the reliability of predictions in the medium term (30 days).
32443640,We analyzed the official data and the predicted evolution of the epidemic in the Italian regions, and we compared the results with the data and predictions of Spain and South Korea.
32443640,We linked the model equations to the changes in people's mobility, with reference to Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports.
32443640,We discussed the effectiveness of policies taken by different regions and countries and how they have an impact on past and future infection scenarios.
32444358,To understand the epidemiology and burden of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) during the first epidemic wave on the west coast of the United States.
32444358,Prospective cohort study.
32444358,Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees.
32444358,Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington).
32444358,Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay.
32444358,The effective reproduction number (<i>R<sub>E</sub></i> ) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region.
32444358,As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington.
32444358,Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days).
32444358,The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%).
32444358,For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days).
32444358,The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients.
32444358,Reductions in <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> were identified over the study period within each region.
32444358,Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high.
32444358,Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing interventions.
32444993,The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available literature to determine what may be considered urgent indications for total hip arthroplasty, in the unprecedented setting of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
32444993,SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently presenting in the form of a global pandemic, referred to as COVID-19.
32444993,In this setting, multiple states have issued executive orders prohibiting &quot;elective&quot; surgery, including arthroplasty, in order to preserve healthcare resources.
32444993,However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective surgery, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely &quot;elective&quot; procedure, versus an &quot;urgent&quot; procedure, particularly regarding hip arthroplasty.
32444993,We reviewed the available literature for articles discussing the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty.
32444993,Based upon the indications discussed in these articles, we further stratified these indications into &quot;elective&quot; versus &quot;urgent&quot; categories.
32444993,In patients presenting with hip arthroplasty indications, the decision to proceed urgently with surgery should be based upon (a) the potential harm incurred by the patient if the surgery was delayed and (b) the potential risk incurred by the patient in the context of COVID-19 if surgery was performed.
32444993,The authors present a decision-making algorithm for determining surgical urgency in three patients who underwent surgery in this context.
32444993,Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors.
32444993,These decisions are best made in coordination with a multidisciplinary committee of one's peers.
32444993,Region-specific issues such as hospital resources and availability of PPE may also inform the decision-making process.
32445580,In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan.
32445580,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described.
32445580,Adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (≥ 5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n=70), severe patients (n=195) and critical patients (n=43).
32445580,Laboratory data, demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records.
32445580,The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity.
32445580,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment.
32445580,Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads.
32445580,The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (p=0.026).
32445580,The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (p&lt;0.001).
32445580,The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was negatively correlated with portion parameters of blood routine and lymphocyte subsets, and was positively associated with laboratory features of cardiovascular system.
32445580,The serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.
32446285,The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the world into the midst of a new pandemic.
32446285,In the human body, the virus causes COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals.
32446285,SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus that causes the disease SARS.
32446285,Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces.
32446285,Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the US and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis.
32446285,Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines.
32446305,The COVID-19 pandemic has currently overtaken every other health issue throughout the world.
32446305,There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues.
32446305,Here we reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB), which still ranks as the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease globally.
32446305,There may be grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped.
32446305,TB control programmes will be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus, such that some activities cannot or will not be prioritised.
32446305,This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes.
32446305,Further, TB patients often have underlying co-morbidities and lung damage that may make them prone to more severe COVID-19.
32446305,The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever.
32446305,Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19.
32446305,Children with TB are a vulnerable group especially likely to suffer as part of the &quot;collateral damage&quot;.
32446305,There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TB-HIV, and this will require unpicking.
32446305,Lessons for COVID-19 could be learned from the vast experience of running global TB control programmes, while the astonishingly rapid and relatively well co-ordinated response to COVID-19 demonstrates how existing programmes could be significantly improved.
32446721,Super-spreading events in an outbreak can change the nature of an epidemic.
32446721,Therefore, it is useful for public health teams to determine if an ongoing outbreak has any contribution from such events, which may be amenable to interventions.
32446721,We estimated the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) and the dispersion factor (k) from empirical data on clusters of epidemiologically-linked COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
32446721,This allowed us to infer the presence or absence of super-spreading events during the early phase of these outbreaks.
32446721,The relatively large values of k implied that large cluster sizes, compatible with super-spreading, were unlikely.
32447059,In Ontario, on March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, a directive was issued to all acute care hospitals to halt non-essential procedures in anticipation for a potential surge in COVID-19 patients.
32447059,This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel, given that these procedures would draw from the same pool of resources required for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32447059,We adapted the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model by adding a cardiac component to determine the impact of various policy decisions on the incremental waitlist growth and estimated waitlist mortality for three key groups of cardiovascular disease patients; coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias.
32447059,We provided predictions based on COVID-19 epidemiology available in real-time, in 3 phases.
32447059,First, in the initial crisis phase, in a worst case scenario, we showed that the potential number of waitlist related cardiac deaths would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if critical cardiac care resources were diverted to the care of COVID-19 patients.
32447059,Second, with better local epidemiology data, we predicted that across five regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures.
32447059,Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial.
32447059,These outputs informed timely, data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the provision of cardiovascular care.
32447496,The sudden onset of smell and taste loss has been reported as a symptom related to COVID-19.
32447496,There is urgent need to provide insight to the pandemic and evaluate anosmia as a potential screening symptom that might contribute to the decision to test suspected cases or guide quarantine instructions.
32447496,Systematic review of the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane databases and preprints up to May 3, 2020.
32447496,Combined search terms included: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;, &quot;anosmia&quot;, &quot;hyposmia&quot;, &quot;olfactory loss&quot;, &quot;smell loss&quot;, &quot;taste loss&quot;, and &quot;hypogeusia&quot;.
32447496,Our search identified 18 reviewed articles and 6 manuscript preprints, including a large epidemiological study, four observational case series, five case-controlled studies, five cross-sectional studies, five case series of anosmic patients and four electronic surveys.
32447496,Great methodological differences were noted.
32447496,A significant prevalence of anosmia is reported in COVID-19 patients.
32447496,Controlled studies indicate that anosmia is more common in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other viral infections or controls.
32447496,Most of the studies reported either smell loss or smell plus taste loss.
32447496,Less severe COVID-19 disease is related to a greater prevalence of anosmia.
32447496,A quick recovery of the smell loss may be expected in most COVID-19 cases.
32447496,Anosmia is more prevalent in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other respiratory infections or controls.
32447742,The month of December 2019 became a critical part of the time of humanity when the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Wuhan, Hubei Province in China.
32447742,As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19.
32447742,The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans.
32447742,In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly.
32447742,Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions.
32447742,The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea.
32447742,However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms.
32447742,It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32447742,Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32447742,Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
32447742,Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32447820,The world entered the year 2020 with reports of the emergence of a new viral illness in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
32447820,In January 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified to be the causative novel coronavirus for the cluster of patients suffering from pneumonia in China.
32447820,The disease was later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
32447820,Several studies, since then, have tried to study and explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2, its structure and pathogenicity, epidemiology, modes of transmission, spectrum of illness and causes of mortality and morbidity.
32447820,The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications.
32447820,With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope.
32447820,This review intends to cover the current known aspects of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-19, based on the available literature.
32447904,<b>Objective:</b> To estimate the infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 under different exposure conditions. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective study was used to conduct continuous quarantine medical observations of close contacts of people infected with COVID-19, collect epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and laboratory test data to estimate the infection rate of close contacts under different exposures. <b>Results:</b> The epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Ningbo showed persistent human-to-human characteristics.
32447904,A total of 2 147 close contacts were tracked and investigated.
32447904,The total infection rate was 6.15%.
32447904,The infection rates of confirmed cases and positive contacts were 6.30% and 4.11%, respectively.
32447904,The difference was not statistically significant (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32447904,Among close contacts of different relationships, friends/pilgrims (22.31%), family members (18.01%), and relatives (4.73%) have a higher infection rate, and close contacts of medical staff were not infected.
32447904,Differences in infection rates among the close contacts were statistically significant (<i>P</i>&lt;0.005).
32447904,Living with the case (13.26%), taking the same transportation (11.91%), and dining together (7.18%) are high risk factors for infection.
32447904,Cross-infection in the hospital should not be ignored (1.94%).
32447904,The median of incubation period is 5 days. <b>Conclusion:</b> The infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases is high, and isolation medical observation measures should be implemented in strict accordance with the close contact management plan. <b>目的：</b> 估算新型冠状病毒肺炎病例密切接触者的感染率，评估不同暴露状况下新型冠状病毒肺炎的发病风险。
32447904,<b>方法：</b> 采用前瞻性研究的方法，对新型冠状病毒肺炎病例和无症状感染者的密切接触者进行持续隔离医学观察，收集流行病学、临床表现和实验室检测资料，估算不同暴露下的密切接触者感染率。
32447904,<b>结果：</b> 宁波市新型冠状病毒肺炎发病流行曲线呈现持续的人传人特征。
32447904,共追踪调查了2 147名密切接触者，总感染率为6.15%，确诊病例、无症状感染者的密切接触者感染率分别为6.30%和4.11%，差异无统计学意义（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）。
32447904,不同关系的密切接触者中，以朋友/香客（22.31%）、家庭成员（18.01%）、亲戚（4.73%）感染较高率，医务人员密切接触者未发生感染，各密切接触者人群感染率差异有统计学意义（<i>P</i>&lt;0.005）。
32447904,与病例同住（13.26%）、乘坐同一个交通工具（11.91%）、聚餐娱乐（7.18%）均是感染高危因素。
32447904,医院诊疗环境下的交叉感染也不容忽视（1.94%）。
32447904,潜伏期中位数为5 d。
32447904,<b>结论：</b> 新型冠状病毒肺炎病例密切接触者的感染率高，需严格按照密切接触者管理方案实施隔离医学观察措施。.
32448490,At the end of the year 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was spreading in Wuhan, China, and the outbreak process has a high speed.
32448490,It was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
32448490,Coronaviruses are enveloped and single-stranded RNA that have several families including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32448490,The pathogenesis mechanism and disease outcomes of SARS and MERS are now clear to some extent, but little information is available for 2019-nCoV.
32448490,This newly identified corona virus infection represents flu-like symptoms, but usually the first symptoms are fever and dry cough.
32448490,There has been no specific treatment against 2019-nCoV up to now, and physicians only apply supportive therapy.
32448490,In the present article, we made an attempt to review the behavior of the virus around the world, epidemiology, a pathway for influx into the host cells, clinical presentation, as well as the treatments currently in use and future approaches; nitazoxanide may be our dream drug.
32448490,We hope that this review has a positive impact on public knowledge for helping to deal with the 2019-nCoV and move one step forward toward its treatment in the near future.
32448805,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to many countries and has been declared a global health emergency.
32448805,Our center is located in the south of Italy where the infection rates were low and the clusters of COVID-19 positive patients were small and inhomogeneous.
32448805,The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic.
32448805,The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments.
32448805,The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency.
32448805,A &quot;clean&quot; team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation.
32448805,Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff.
32448805,Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required.
32448805,Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people.
32448805,Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check.
32448805,This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future.
32448805,In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region.
32448805,These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.
32449614,In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China causing many cases of severe pneumonia.
32449614,World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32449614,The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19.
32449614,As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths.
32449614,The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation.
32449614,The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32449614,Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators.
32449614,The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.
32449614,Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes.
32449614,Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.
32450246,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-2019 is a new global health challenge which causes severe respiratory complications.
32450246,As of May 17th, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 4.6 million people and caused 310,000 deaths, worldwide.
32450246,In order to study potential impact of infection, complete epidemiological information should be reported on regular basis however, data from Pakistan has not yet been published.
32450246,This retrospective study is the first report of epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Faisalabad, Pakistan.
32450246,On April 4th, 2020, 128 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from city Faisalabad were transported to Postgraduate Research Institute, Lahore for further processing.
32450246,RNA was extracted using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit and real-time PCR was performed to quantify COVID-19.
32450246,Our finding showed that overall prevalence of COVID-19 in Faisalabad on April 4th was 17.18% (22 of 128).
32450246,Prevalence was higher in males (n = 17; 77.2%) as compared to females (n = 5; 22.8%) but this gender-wise difference was not statistically significant.
32450246,Patients belonging to age group 37-47 years were found to be most (45.5%) infected with COVID-19.
32450310,This study was designed to assess the impact of public health policy in Australia in response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the delivery of neurosurgical services.
32450310,Being essential services, we postulated that there would not be a decrease in elective and emergency neurosurgical presentations and surgeries.
32450310,This is a prospective, observational, epidemiological study in strict adherence to the STROBE guidelines.
32450310,It is a cross-sectional, multicentric study involving five tertiary neurosurgical centres to capture all public neurosurgical admissions in Queensland during the last three months (Feb-April, 2020) of significant public health policy changes to combat COVID-19.
32450310,An analysis of the 1,298 admissions for the Queensland population of 5.07 million Australians demonstrated a decrease in the number of elective and emergency admissions.
32450310,The decline in elective admissions, particularly degenerative spine, benign neoplasms and vascular pathologies, was a direct response of government strategy to curb activity to urgent surgical interventions only.
32450310,Moreover, a trend towards decline in emergency admissions was also noted, partly explained by fewer trauma, but partly attributed to a decline in vascular pathologies including subarachnoid haemorrhage.
32450310,In comparison to Europe and North America, this study demonstrates the impact of proactive public health measures in Australia that successfully flattened the COVID-19 curve, whilst facilitating ongoing care of the acutely unwell neurosurgical patients.
32450727,The chest CT findings that can distinguish patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from those with clinically suspected COVID-19 but subsequently found to be COVID-19 negative have not previously been described in detail.
32450727,The purpose of this study was to determine the distinctions among patients with COVID-19 by comparing the imaging findings of patients with suspected confirmed COVID-19 and those of patients initially suspected to haveCOVID-19 who were ultimately negative for the disease. 28 isolated suspected in-patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 22, 2020, to February 6, 2020. 12 patients were confirmed to have positive severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA results, and 16 patients had negative results.
32450727,The thin-section CT imaging findings and clinical and laboratory data of all the patients were evaluated.
32450727,There were no significant differences between the 12 confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2-positive) patients and 16 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients in epidemiology and most of the clinical features or laboratory data.
32450727,The CT images showed that the incidence of pure/mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) was not different between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients [9/12 (75.0%) <i>vs</i> 10/16 (62.5%), <i>p</i> = 0.687], but pure/mixed GGOs in the peripheral were more common in patients with COVID-19 [11/12 (91.7%) <i>vs</i> 6/16 (37.5%), <i>p</i> = 0.006].
32450727,There were no significant differences in the number of lesions, bilateral lung involvement, large irregular/patchy opacities, rounded opacities, linear opacities, crazy-paving patterns, halo signs, interlobular septal thickening or air bronchograms.
32450727,Although peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on CT may help distinguish patients with COVID-19 from clinically suspected but negative patients, CT cannot replace RT-PCR testing.
32450727,Peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on-chest CT findings can be helpful in distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from those with clinically suspected COVID-19 but subsequently found to be COVID-19 negative.
32450906,Emerging evidence from China suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is deadlier for infected men than women with a 2.8% fatality rate being reported in Chinese men versus 1.7% in women.
32450906,Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men.
32450906,Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.
32450906,The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men.
32450906,The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China.
32450906,We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging.
32450906,Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies.
32450906,The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.
32450906,The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.
32451162,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised several issues regarding the management of surgical patients.
32451162,The aim of the current study was to clarify the management of oncologic and surgical patients during the pandemic.
32451162,Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers' safety, were included.
32451162,The last date of research for this study was April 4, 2020.
32451162,We analyzed 28 papers.
32451162,Real-time polymerase chain reaction was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and computed tomography scans were considered useful for cases of diagnostic uncertainty.
32451162,Cancer patients and surgical patients were confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and negative outcome.
32451162,To guarantee adequate care to these patients, while minimizing the risk for infection, the early postponing of elective surgery, the creation of COVID-free facilities and the identification of COVID- dedicated operating theaters and teams have been proposed.
32451162,The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers.
32451162,Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer.
32451162,Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting.
32451162,Also, clinicians should value the importance of self-protection and mental health care.
32452539,Months after the outbreak of a new flu-like disease in China, the entire world is now in a state of caution.
32452539,The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
32452539,Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
32452539,This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.
32452539,Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed.
32452587,Epidemiology of Covid-19 and diffusion patterns of the novel coronavirus (SARS - CoV - 2) are still poorly understood, as they differ substantially among countries and even in neighboring regions within the same country.
32452587,It is not clear if differences in viral spreading depends on population age, genetic influences, specific environmental factors (e.g. season of the year), socioeconomic conditions or a combination of these.
32452587,Some Authors hypothesized that differences in models of SARS - CoV - 2 diffusion may be explained also on the basis of ethnic influences (Pareek, Bangash, Pareek, Pan, Sze, Minhas, Hanif, Khunti, 2020).
32452587,Under such perspective, it seems rational to compare the Italian experience to that of Uruguay.
32452644,The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic carries clinical, economic and social burdens that are currently being disclosed.
32452644,The key steps of virus life cycle have been recently clarified, highlighting the role of host type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 serine protease in virus-cell binding and entry, respectively.
32452644,Importantly, major concerns derive from the androgen-dependent tissue-expression of both TMPRSS2 and ACE2, suggesting a differential clinical course of the infection between genders.
32452644,In agreement with this model, available epidemiological data show that the disease in males has an higher risk to display an heavier pattern and associates with both an increased access to critical care unit and higher mortality rate.
32452644,In this opinion article, available evidence linking the androgen activity with the gender differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed, hypothesizing possible therapeutic approaches in male based on the disruption of androgen signaling.
32452644,On these bases, gender-specific recommendations for the management of male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection are warmly suggested, in order to improve the clinical course of the disease.
32452648,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses serious threat to global public health and economics.
32452648,Serial interval (SI), time between the symptom onsets of a primary case and a second case, is a key epidemiological parameter.
32452648,We estimated SI of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China based on 27 records of transmission chains.
32452648,We adopted three parametric models: Weibull, Lognormal and Gamma distributions and an interval censored likelihood framework.
32452648,The three models were compared using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc).
32452648,We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the exponential growth to estimate the reproduction number.
32452648,Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated mean SI at 5.9 days (95%CI: 3.9-9.6) and a standard deviation (SD) at 4.8 days (95%CI: 3.1-10.1).
32452648,Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen at 2.6 (95%CI: 2.4-2.8).
32452648,The SI of COVID-19 is relative shorter than that of SARS and MERS, other two beta coronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission was rapid.
32452648,It is crucial to isolate close contacts promptly to control the spread of COVID-19 effectively.
32453074,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern due to a highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV), actually named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32453074,Despite much emerging data about the epidemiological association between cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19, little is still known atrial fibrillation (AF) and its optimal management in this clinical contest.
32453074,The aim of our review is to describe the pharmacological interactions between cardiovascular drugs more commonly used in AF management and experimental COVID-19 therapies, based on European (EU) and Unites States (US) summaries of product characteristics.
32454545,The German debate about the policy implications of the coronavirus becomes increasingly heated given different views on the mortality rate from SARS CoV-2, as well as the epidemiological and economic impact of lockdown measures imposed by the government.
32454545,Impact analysis applying features of randomised control trials would provide clear evidence.
32454545,However, this is currently unavailable due to a lack of an appropriate control group of countries without measures.
32454545,Thus, polarisation is likely to rise if observed mortality rates remain low.
32455503,Background This article responds to one by Graham Martin and colleagues, who offered a critique of my previous publications on face coverings for the lay public in the Covid-19 pandemic.
32455503,Their paper reflects criticisms that have been made of face coverings policies more generally.
32455503,Method Narrative rebuttal.
32455503,Results I address charges that my coauthors and I had misapplied the precautionary principle; drawn conclusions that were not supported by empirical research; and failed to take account of potential harms But before that, I remind my critics that the evidence on face coverings goes beyond the contested trials and observational studies they place centre stage.
32455503,I set out some key findings from basic science, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, case studies, and natural experiments, and use this rich and diverse body of evidence as the backdrop for my rebuttal of their narrowly framed objections.
32455503,I challenge my critics' apparent assumption that a particular kind of systematic review should be valorised over narrative and real-world evidence, since stories are crucial to both our scientific understanding and our moral imagination.
32455503,Conclusion I conclude by thanking my academic adversaries for the intellectual sparring match, but exhort them to remember our professional accountability to a society in crisis.
32455503,It is time to lay straw men to rest and embrace the full range of evidence in the context of the perilous threat the world is now facing.
32457924,Several reports on epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been published.
32457924,However, mortality and morbidity analyses, important for better understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, are scarce.
32457924,We examine the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients who died of COVID-19.
32457924,The cohort consisted of 11 male and 3 female patients, with 9 patients aged 70 years or above, and nearly all had underlying diseases.
32457924,Fever with bilateral pneumonia was the main manifestation.
32457924,Most patients had consolidations combined with ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest computed tomography scan.
32457924,Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia in 10 patients, high blood glucose in 11, GGT in 5 of the 14 patients, and high LDH in 5 of 6 patients tested.
32457924,In addition, this cohort had high level of cytokines such as interleukin-6 in all 8 patients tested.
32457924,The clinical and laboratory parameters in the cohort of fatal cases may be incorporated into future clinical prognosis models and will be of help in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.
32458598,Currently, the local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been effectively contained in China; however, the epidemic situation of this highly infectious disease is more and more serious outside of China.
32458598,Importation of COVID-19 cases from other countries and territories is therefore becoming a new challenge for the control of COVID-19 in China.
32458598,Malaria was once widely epidemic in China.
32458598,Nevertheless, the local transmission of this parasitic disease has been interrupted in China since the launch of the national malaria elimination programme in 2010, and great successes have been achieved in the management of appropriately 3 thousand malaria cases imported from other countries and territories annually.
32458598,Hereby, the epidemiological characteristics and current epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China were analyzed and compared with malaria.
32458598,Based on the successful experiences from the management of overseas imported malaria in China, the strategy and countermeasures for COVID-19 control were proposed, so as to provide insights into the response to the importation of COVID-19 from other countries and territories and the consolidation of the control achievements in China. <b>［摘要］</b> 目前, 我国新型冠状病毒肺炎本地传播已得到有效控 制, 但境外新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情形势日趋严峻。
32458598,因此, 我国新 型冠状病毒肺炎防控工作面临境外输入的新挑战。
32458598,疟疾曾在我 国广泛流行, 自 2010 年启动消除疟疾行动计划后, 我国不仅阻断 了疟疾本地传播, 对每年 3000 例左右境外输入性疟疾病例的防 控也卓有成效。
32458598,本文通过对当前我国新型冠状病毒肺炎和疟疾 疫情形势及流行特征的比较分析, 结合我国境外输入性疟疾防控 的成功经验, 探讨当前新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控的策略和措 施, 为有效应对境外输入、巩固防控成果提供借鉴。.
32458760,The recently emerged novel coronavirus, &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)&quot;, caused a highly contagious disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32458760,The virus was first reported from Wuhan city in China in December, 2019, which in less than three months spread throughout the globe and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11<sup>th</sup> of March, 2020.
32458760,So far, the ongoing pandemic severely damaged the world's most developed countries and is becoming a major threat for low- and middle-income countries.
32458760,The poorest continent, Africa with the most vulnerable populations to infectious diseases, is predicted to be significantly affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
32458760,Therefore, in this review we collected and summarised the currently available literature on the epidemiology, etiology, vulnerability, preparedness and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa, which could be useful and provide necessary information on ongoing COVID-19 pandemics in the continent.
32458760,We also briefly summarised the concomitance of the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming.
32459192,The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment.
32459192,Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.
32459192,In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers.
32459192,In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
32459192,The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
32459192,This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.
32459192,Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.
32459790,Spain has been one of the countries most severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019.
32459790,This study aims to describe a series of children admitted to a PICU due to coronavirus disease 2019 infection.
32459790,Prospective observational study.
32459790,Tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain.
32459790,Children admitted to the PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020.
32459790,Observational study.
32459790,Epidemiologic data, previous clinical characteristics, support therapy needed, imaging tests, laboratory observations on admission, and pharmacologic therapy.
32459790,Eleven children were admitted to the PICU, with suspected coronavirus disease 2019; the polymerase chain reaction test was positive in seven.
32459790,The median age was 100.7 months (range, 0.5-162).
32459790,Five were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward.
32459790,The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0-9), and Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0-16).
32459790,All children were previously healthy except one (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation).
32459790,Respiratory symptoms and fever were prevalent.
32459790,A chest radiograph led to a pneumonia diagnosis.
32459790,Not all patients presented with lymphopenia on admission.
32459790,D-Dimer and ferritin were elevated.
32459790,All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four.
32459790,Mechanical ventilation was necessary in two patients on the first day of PICU admission.
32459790,Two children required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support.
32459790,Tocilizumab was applied in two intubated children.
32459790,Also, four children received heparin.
32459790,No patients died.
32459790,On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old.
32459790,Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy.
32459790,Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission.
32459790,These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.
32460302,As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the globe, the knowledge of its epidemiology, clinical features, and management is rapidly evolving.
32460302,Nevertheless, the data on optimal fluid management strategies for those who develop critical illness remain sparse.
32460302,Adding to the challenge, the fluid volume status of these patients has been found to be dynamic.
32460302,Some present with several days of malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and consequent hypovolemia requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation, while a subset develop acute respiratory distress syndrome with renal dysfunction and lingering congestion necessitating restrictive fluid management.
32460302,Accurate objective assessment of volume status allows physicians to tailor the fluid management goals throughout this wide spectrum of critical illness.
32460302,Conventional point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) enables the reliable assessment of fluid status and reducing the staff exposure.
32460302,However, due to specific characteristics of COVID-19 (e.g., rapidly expanding lung lesions), a single imaging method such as lung POCUS will have significant limitations.
32460302,Herein, we suggest a Tri-POCUS approach that represents concurrent bedside assessment of the lungs, heart, and the venous system.
32460302,This combinational approach is likely to overcome the limitations of the individual methods and provide a more precise evaluation of the volume status in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32461062,To use mathematical models to predict the epidemiological impact of lifting the lockdown in London, UK, and alternative strategies to help inform policy in the UK.
32461062,A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London.
32461062,The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital.
32461062,We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19.
32461062,Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread.
32461062,While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths.
32461062,However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown.
32461062,In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown.
32461062,This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone.
32461062,A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections.
32461062,This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.
32462378,We retrospectively analyzed the data of 32 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 to clarify the epidemiological characteristics of this special population.
32462378,The data of 32 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19, including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological, were collected from the Blood Purification Department of Wuhan Fourth Hospital from February 3 to 16, 2020.
32462378,Of the 32 patients, 23 were male, and the median age was 58 years; the median dialysis vintage was 33 months.
32462378,Two groups were divided according to the patient's primary renal disease: group 1 (16 patients with diabetic nephropathy), group 2 (12 patients with primary glomerulonephritis, 2 with obstructive kidney disease, 1 with hypertensive renal damage, and 1 with polycystic kidney).
32462378,No significant differences were observed between the two groups in epidemiological characteristics, blood cell counts, and radiological performance.
32462378,Hemodialysis patients are susceptible to COVID-19 at all ages, and patients with diabetes may be a high-risk population (50%).
32462378,Common symptoms included fever (15 cases), cough (21 cases), and fatigue (7 cases).
32462378,The blood lymphocyte count decreased in 84.6% of the patients (median: 0.765 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L).
32462378,Chest CT revealed ground-glass-like lesions in 18 cases, unilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, bilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, and pleural effusion in 2 cases.
32462378,Only 46.875% of the hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had fever in the early stage; and diabetics may be the most susceptible population.
32462378,A decrease in blood lymphocyte count and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scan is beneficial in identifying the high-risk population.
32462468,Since its initial outbreak in China, in December, 2019, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe.
32462468,At the time of writing, on April 29, 2020, infections had been confirmed in more than 200 countries and regions and 3,018,681 infections and 207,973 deaths had been recorded.
32462468,In Japan, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on January 16, 2020, since when, the number of domestic infections and the death toll have reached 13,852 and 389, respectively, representing exponential increases.
32462468,Moreover, both domestically and internationally, the shortage of medical resources and the spread of infection among medical personnel, caused by nosocomial transmissions have become problematic.
32462468,The pathology of COVID-19, including the exact infection route, remains largely unknown.
32462468,Given the unavailability of an effective cure and vaccine, people are required to respond to this adversity without becoming complacent.
32462468,The global efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing endeavors, far from over.
32462468,New epidemiological data and clinical findings are emerging on a daily basis, making it critical to always refer to the latest information.
32463179,Because other coronaviruses enter the cells by binding to dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4), it has been speculated that DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) may exert an activity against SARS-CoV-2.
32463179,In the absence of clinical trial results, we analyzed epidemiological data to support or discard such hypothesis.
32463179,We retrieved information on exposure to DPP-4i among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized for COVID-19 at an outbreak hospital in Italy.
32463179,As reference, we retrieved exposure to DPP-4i among matched T2D patients in the same Region.
32463179,Of 403 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 85 had T2D.
32463179,The rate of exposure to DPP-4i was similar between T2D patients with COVID-19 (10.6%) and 14 857 matched patients in the Region (8.8%), or 793 matched patients in the local outpatient clinic (15.4%), 8284 matched patients hospitalized for other reasons (8.5%), and when comparing 71 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia (11.3%) to 351 matched patients with pneumonia of other etiology (10.3%).
32463179,T2D patients with COVID-19 who were on DPP-4i had a similar disease outcome as those who were not.
32463179,In summary, we found no evidence that DPP-4i might affect hospitalization for COVID-19.

32463221,Higher rates of serious illness and death from coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection among older people and those who have comorbidities suggest that age- and disease-related biological processes make such individuals more sensitive to environmental stress factors including infectious agents like coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32463221,Specifically, impaired redox homeostasis and associated oxidative stress appear to be important biological processes that may account for increased individual susceptibility to diverse environmental insults.
32463221,The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness.
32463221,The hypothesis that glutathione deficiency is the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in COVID-19 patients was proposed on the basis of an exhaustive literature analysis and observations.
32463221,The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.
32463475,Increasing evidence indicates immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) after covid-19, but it remains unclear for how long the protection remains.
32463475,Serology testing seems to have a higher sensitivity than molecular diagnostics from 8 days after onset of symtoms, and should be part of risk assessment and epidemiological studies of COVID-19.
32463475,The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant.
32463475,Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies.
32463475,Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity.
32463475,Carefully selected serological POC tests for sars-cov-2 can be used in large scale testing but should only be used by licensed medical staff able to understand their limitations and interpret the results.
32464084,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still progressing and has been recorded in more than 210 countries and territories worldwide.
32464084,In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first cases of COVID-19 were detected on 5th of March 2020 in the entity of Republic of Srpska and 9th of March 2020 in the entity of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
32464084,Up until the 16th of May 2020, more than 2,200 COVID-19 cases were recorded in both entities, with a mortality rate of 5.8% (131 out of 2231 cases).
32464084,The aim of this ongoing study is to present the current epidemiological and sociodemographic parameters of 380 COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (UCH Mostar) during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32464084,Out of 380 patients, 60 (15.8%) of them required hospitalization.
32464084,The mortality rate was 5% (19/380).
32464084,The highest mortality rate of 15.2% (12/79) was recorded in the patients age ≥65 years.
32464084,In addition to this single-centre experience of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the epidemiological measures imposed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with emphasis on the restrictive ones.
32464084,The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
32464333,Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewage for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).
32464333,During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide.
32464333,Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters.
32464333,To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance.
32464333,Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set.
32464333,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250 ml of wastewaters collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data.
32464333,Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive.
32464333,One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.
32464333,The study confirms that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.
32464367,A comprehensive review of the neurological disorders reported during the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that infection with SARS-CoV-2 affects the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the muscle.
32464367,CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection.
32464367,Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers.
32464367,Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses.
32464367,Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm.
32464367,A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified.
32464367,There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis.
32464367,The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis.
32464367,The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis.
32464367,On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic.
32464367,International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the natural history of this worldwide problem.
32466577,The phylogenetic clustering of 95 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the first 3 months of the pandemic reveals insights into the early evolution of the virus and gives first indications of how the variants are globally distributed.
32466577,Variants might become a challenge in terms of diagnostics, immunology, and effectiveness of drugs.
32466577,All available whole genome sequence data from the NCBI database (March 16, 2020) were phylogenetically analyzed, and gene prediction as well as analysis of selected variants were performed.
32466577,Antigenic regions and the secondary protein structure were predicted for selected variants.
32466577,While some clusters are presenting the same variant with 100% identical bases, other SARS-CoV-2 lineages show a beginning diversification and phylogenetic clustering due to base substitutions and deletions in the genomes.
32466577,First molecular epidemiological investigations are possible with the results by adding metadata as travelling history to the presented data.
32466577,The advantage of variants in source tracing can be a challenge in terms of virulence, immune response, and immunological memory.
32466577,Variants of viruses often show differences in virulence or antigenicity.
32466577,This must also be considered in decisions like herd immunity.
32466577,Diagnostic methods might not work if the variations or deletions are in target regions for the detection of the pathogen.
32466577,One base substitution was detected in a primer binding site.
32468631,The Covid-19 pandemic needs to be considered from two perspectives simultaneously.
32468631,First, there are questions about which policies are most effective and fair in the here and now, as the pandemic unfolds.
32468631,These polices concern, for example, who should receive priority in being tested, how to implement contact tracing, or how to decide who should get ventilators or vaccines when not all can.
32468631,Second, it is imperative to anticipate the medium- and longer-term consequences that these policies have.
32468631,The case of vaccine rationing is particularly instructive.
32468631,Ethical, epidemiological, and economic reasons demand that rationing approaches give priority to groups who have been structurally and historically disadvantaged, even if this means that overall life years gained may be lower.
32469620,In March 2020, the United States experienced an unprecedented event that suddenly demanded that researchers cease all nonessential activities to mitigate the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV2.
32469620,Within the research community, the impact of this cessation on early career investigators was significant, in part because the support systems (<i>i.e.</i>, mentors and institutions) that early career investigators typically rely on were also significantly impacted.
32469620,This article presents the stories of the impact of COVID-19 on early career investigators within the NIH Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health and Women's Reproductive Health Research K12 career development programs.
32469620,We discuss the common challenges that we faced across our respective fields ranging from basic to clinical to epidemiological women's health research, including the impact it had on our career trajectories.
32469620,In addition, we share lessons learned in an effort to strengthen our research workforce and increase our resiliency during this and future challenges.
32469853,The COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) has generated a wide-ranging debate regarding epidemiological forecasts and the global implications.
32469853,With the data obtained from the Chilean Ministry of Health (MINSAL), a prospective study was carried out using the generalized SEIR model to estimate the course of COVID-19 in Chile.
32469853,Three scenarios were estimated: Scenario 1 with official MINSAL data; scenario 2 with official MINSAL data and recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health; and scenario 3 with official MINSAL data, recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health, and without considering deaths in the total recovered.
32469853,There are considerable differences between scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3 in the number of deaths, active patients, and duration of the disease.
32469853,Scenario 3, considered the most adverse, estimates a total of 11,000 infected people, 1,151 deaths, and that the peak of the disease will occur in the first days of May.
32469853,We concluded that the concept of recovered may be decisive for the epidemiological forecasts of COVID-19 in Chile.
32469853,La pandemia de COVID-19 declarada por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha generado un amplio debate respecto de las proyecciones epidemiológicas que tendrá a nivel global en nuestro planeta.
32469853,Con los datos obtenidos del Ministerio de Salud de Chile (MINSAL), se efectuó un estudio prospectivo utilizando un modelo SEIR (Susceptible-Expuesto-Infectado-Recuperado) generalizado con el objetivo de estimar la evolución del COVID-19 en Chile.
32469853,La estimación se realizó bajo tres escenarios con datos oficiales del Ministerio de Salud: escenario 1 solo con datos oficiales; escenario 2 se añade el criterio de recuperados propuesto por organizaciones internacionales de salud y escenario 3 se incorpora el criterio de recuperados propuesto por organizaciones internacionales de salud, sin considerar fallecidos en el total de recuperados.
32469853,Existen diferencias considerables entre el escenario 1 en comparación al 2 y 3 en número de fallecidos, enfermos activos y duración de la enfermedad.
32469853,El escenario 3, considerado el más adverso, estima un total de 11 000 personas contagiadas, 1151 fallecidos y que el máximo de la enfermedad ocurriría durante los primeros días de mayo.
32469853,Se concluye que el concepto de recuperado puede ser decisivo para las proyecciones epidemiológicas de COVID-19 en Chile.
32470151,The wide spectrum of symptoms observed in COVID-19 appears to defy explanation.
32470151,Apart from geographic limitation to people with prior exposure to other coronaviruses and air pollutants, inflammatory comordidities and older ages are also among the main factors of susceptibility to severe illness.
32470151,The unusual epidemiological data pointed out in children and African territories have revealed new insights in host-pathogen interplay with more focus on epigenetic regulation of cognitive compartments belonging to innate immunity.
32470151,Should trained immunity be proven to be involved in timely immune responsiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and that adaptive memory could be detrimental, both treatment regimens and vaccine design will tremendously change accordingly with more focus on upper respiratory tissue innate immunity to subdue this threat underway.

32471302,The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached over five million confirmed cases worldwide, and numbers are still growing at a fast rate.
32471302,Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions.
32471302,In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future.
32471302,While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown.
32471302,Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies.
32471302,We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals.
32471302,We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.
32471513,A cluster of pneumonia cases were reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China in December 2019.
32471513,A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life.
32471513,We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020.
32471513,Respondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire.
32471513,We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status.
32471513,We also investigated respondents' behavior changes.
32471513,Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests.
32471513,In total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained.
32471513,More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%).
32471513,Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities.
32471513,About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia.
32471513,Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status.
32471513,Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities.
32471513,At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection.
32471513,The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%).
32471513,We need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities.
32471513,Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups.
32471513,The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.
32473009,The ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging global public health system.
32473009,Sex-differences in infectious diseases are a common but neglected problem.
32473009,We used the national surveillance database of COVID-19 in mainland China to compared gender differences in attack rate (AR), proportion of severe and critical cases (PSCC) and case fatality rate (CFR) in relation to age, affected province, and onset-to-diagnosis interval.
32473009,The overall AR was significantly higher in female population than in males (63.9 versus 60.5 per million persons; P ˂ .001).
32473009,By contrast, PSCC and CFR were significantly lower among female patients (16.9% and 4.0%) than among males (19.5% and 7.2%), with ORs of 0.87 and 0.57, respectively (both P ˂ .001).
32473009,The female-to-male differences were age-dependent, which were significant among people aged 50-69 years for AR, and in the patients of 30-years or older for both PSCC and CFR (all P ≤ .001).
32473009,The AR, PSCC and CFR varied greatly from province to province.
32473009,However, female-to-male differences in AR, PSCC and CFR were significant in the epicenter, Hubei province, where 82.2% confirmed cases and 97.4% deaths occurred.
32473009,After adjusting for age, affected province and onset-to-diagnosis interval, the female-to-male difference in AR, PSCC and CFR remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analyses.
32473009,We elucidate an age-dependent gender dimorphism for COVID-19, in which the females have higher susceptibility but lower severity and fatality.
32473009,Further epidemiological and biological investigations are required to better understand the sex-specific differences for effective interventions.
32473036,To investigate control measures for COVID-19 pandemic in GIE centers in China.
32473036,This is a retrospective multi-centre research, including seven centers.
32473036,Data collection was from 1st Feb to 31st Mar 2020 and the same period last year.
32473036,There were a total of 28 COVID-19 definite cases in these hospitals.
32473036,Six out of seven GIE centers were arranged to shut down on 1<sup>st</sup> Feb, with a mean shutdown days of 23.6±5.3.
32473036,The actual workloads were only 10.3%-62.9% compared to those last year.
32473036,All centers had a preoperative COVID-19 screening process.
32473036,Epidemiological questionnaire, temperature taking and QR-code of journey were conducted.
32473036,Chest CT scan were conducted during the shutdown period and continued in five centers after return to work.
32473036,Antibody and nucleic acid test were applied in 1-3 centers.
32473036,All endoscopists had advanced PPE.
32473036,Five centers used surgical mask and the rest used N95 mask.
32473036,Six centers used goggles or face shield.
32473036,Five centers selected isolation gowns and the rest selected protective suits.
32473036,The change frequency of these PPE was 4 hours.
32473036,Sterilizing measures were improved in six centers.
32473036,Five centers utilized ultraviolet and six centers strengthened natural ventilation.
32473036,Four and six centers used peracetic acid during the period of shutdown and return to work, alone or matched with OPA or acidified water.
32473036,Many effective control measures were conducted in GIE centers during the outbreak, including patients' volume limitation, preoperative COVID-19 screening, advanced PPE and disinfection methods.
