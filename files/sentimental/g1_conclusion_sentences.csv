32473352, The S protein structure further validated the presence of predicted peptides on the surface, of which 20 are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable epitope binding efficiency.
32473352, The work could be useful for understanding the immunodominant regions in the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially help in designing some peptide-based diagnostics.
32473352, Also, identified T-cell epitopes might be considered for incorporation in vaccine designs.Copyright © 2019.

32472990,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which recently has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having killed almost 250,000 people worldwide as of May 4th 2020.
32472990, Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is now evident that it may also affect the cardiovascular system in multiple ways.The current paper is a review of the most recent literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated main cardiovascular clinical manifestations.Cardiovascular disease represents a prevalent underlying comorbidity associated with increased mortality rates among COVID-19 affected individuals.
32472990, In addition, various cardiovascular manifestations have been linked to the viral insult, including among others acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, acute heart failure, cardiac injury, arrhythmias and acute pulmonary embolism.Further studies are required in order to establish the complicated association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects on the cardiovascular system.
32472990, Our knowledge regarding diagnostic approaches, therapeutic management and preventive measures is constantly enriched throughout an abundance of ongoing research in the respective fields.
32472459, Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19.
32472459, Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach.
32472459, Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients.
32472459, We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points• Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.• No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.• A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.• Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.
32472024, The two regions: Veneto and Lombardy, implemented different strategies to control the viral spread.
32472024, In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated.
32472024, We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact.
32472024, We strongly recommend that decision-makers:ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts;maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services;rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples;equip the population with protective masks.
32471894, Both platforms demonstrate comparable performance; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 hours and 45 minutes, respectively.
32471894, In search for a platform with shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 minutes.
32471894, We present here the results of comparisons between Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media and comparisons between Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media for Cepheid and dry nasal swabs for Abbott ID NOW.
32471894, Regardless of method of collection and sample type, Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 had negative results in a third of the samples that tested positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress when using nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media and 45% when using dry nasal swabs.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32471794, The laboratory findings revealed normal WBC and CRP despite apparent lung infiltrations, and typical observations on CT imaging were important diagnostic clues.

32470885, In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.To determine the analytical performance of the ID NOW assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.Residual NP samples collected in viral transport media were tested by the ID NOW platform in two independent laboratories.
32470885, Results were compared to either the CDC or New York EUA assays, which served as reference methods.Overall agreement of ID NOW was 78.7%. Sensitivity was 71.7% and specificity was 100%. Notably, all false-negative results correlated to those samples that were weakly positive.ID NOW performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has reduced sensitivity for weakly positive samples.
32470885, This sensitivity, among other concerns, should be taken into consideration when using this test for patients with a low suspicion for COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32469732, Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones.
32469732, Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations.The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities.
32469732, Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32468845, The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to emergency radiology practice.
32468845, The continuity of an effective emergency imaging service for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients is essential, while adhering to best infection control practices.
32468845, Under the direction of the Board of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, this general guidance document has been synthesized by collaborative consensus of a group of emergency radiologists.
32468845, These recommendations aim to assist radiologists involved in emergency diagnostic imaging to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and continue to add value to patient care in the emergency setting.
32466862, The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.
32466862, According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.Copyright © 2020 Sociedad Española de Otorrinolaringología y Cirugía de Cabeza y Cuello.

32466577, Variants of viruses often show differences in virulence or antigenicity.
32466577, This must also be considered in decisions like herd immunity.
32466577, Diagnostic methods might not work if the variations or deletions are in target regions for the detection of the pathogen.
32466577, One base substitution was detected in a primer binding site.
32464670, For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
32464670, After the initial rollout and several "hygiene inspections" only minor improvements to the concept were necessary.
32464670, All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.
32464670, Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a dynamic process with regular changes in the development and information status, the operational concept is regularly reviewed for validity and adjusted as necessary.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32463475, The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant.
32463475, Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies.
32463475, Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity.
32463475, Carefully selected serological POC tests for sars-cov-2 can be used in large scale testing but should only be used by licensed medical staff able to understand their limitations and interpret the results.
32462968, Gold nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots in colorimetric and immunochromatographic assays, silica nanoparticles in a polymerase chain reaction and spike protein nanospheres as antigen carriers and adjuvants in vaccine formulations present notable examples in diagnostics and prevention, while uses of nanoparticles in coronavirus infection treatments have been merely sporadic.
32462968, The current absence of antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, might be largely due to the underuse of nanotechnologies.
32462968, Elucidating the interface between nanoparticles and coronaviruses is timely, but presents the only route to the rational design of precisely targeted therapeutics for coronavirus infections.
32462968, Such a fundamental approach is also a viable prophylaxis against future pandemics of this type.
32462770, Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible in order to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic.

32462445, We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP.
32462445, The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary.One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56-0.85).
32462445, This model allowed for the identification of 8-50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients.Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases.
32462445, However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases.• Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans. • ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms. • Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases.
32462398, Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%).
32462398, Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%).
32462398, Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%).According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals.
32462398, New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.
32462267, Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes.
32462267, As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified.
32462267, As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn.
32462267, As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention.
32461502, At any time, the arriving waves of the pandemic are testing the capacity of governments.
32461502, The health services struggle to keep the plateau in a steady-state below 100 deaths per million inhabitants.
32461502, Therefore, it is necessary to increase the alternatives and supplies based on the current and near-future expected demands imposed by the number of deaths by COVID-19.
32461502, Estimating COVID-19 mortality in various scenarios with the gradual release of social constraints will help predict the magnitude of those arriving waves.
32460185, Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump).
32460185, The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of ≥9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.
32460185, Overall, these findings are largely consistent with the results of the first CAS investigation and support the validity of this mental health screener for COVID-19 related research and practice.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32459857, We support the recommendation of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis for inpatients with COVID-19 as a very minimum in the absence of strict contraindications, while recognising that pulmonary thrombotic complications can occur under standard thromboprophylaxis.
32459857, We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with COVID-19 where a discrepant evolution of C-reactive protein and D-dimer is observed.
32459857, Therapeutic levels of anticoagulation are obligatory where new evidence of a macrovascular thrombotic complication has been documented.
32459857, More research to delineate the macro- and microvascular thrombotic complications of COVID-19, and the therapeutic implications for this patient group is required.
32459655, The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for ICU and desired more time for it.
32459655, Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about using mobile phones for remote monitoring, and AI-based intelligent alarm management.This survey study among ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine.
32459655, Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm SOPs, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing digital literacy of ICU staff.
32459655, Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03514173; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03514173.
32459192, In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
32459192, The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
32459192, This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.
32459192, Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.
32459046, Cardiovascular disease and, in particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has emerged as an important consideration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32459046, The diagnosis of VTE using standardized objective testing is problematic in these patients, given the risk of infecting non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and hospital personnel, coupled with the usual challenges of performing diagnostic testing in critically-ill patients.
32459046, Early reports suggest a high incidence of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe illness, that is similar to the high VTE rates observed in patients with other viral pneumonias, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).This article is protected by copyright.

32458125, Ninety-two percent of patients had respiratory symptoms, and 8% of them had digestive symptoms.
32458125, Fever (92%), cough (60%) and fatigue (56%) were the most common symptoms.
32458125, Most patients had a normal or reduced WBC (96%), reduced lymphocyte count (60%), increased CRP (48%) and increased ESR (44%).
32458125, Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the typical radiological finding on chest CT.Characteristic chest CT imaging features could appear earlier than the viral nucleic acid assay results.
32457036, Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.© Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32455796,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the current uncontrolled outbreak of infectious disease, has caused significant challenges throughout the world.
32455796, A reliable rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 is demanded worldwide.
32455796, The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain was one of the most quickly established methods in the novel viral pandemic and was considered as the gold standard for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32455796, In this report, we illustrate our experience of applying a protocol from the Taiwan CDC and achieving assay optimization in the immediate circumstances to meet the urgent medical and public health needs.
32454807, Minor, non-specific changes in biochemical variables were reported.
32454807, Studies that tested breast milk reported negative SARS-CoV-2 results.Given the paucity of studies at this time, vertical transmission cannot be confirmed or denied.
32454807, Current literature does not support abstaining from breastfeeding nor separating mothers and newborns.
32454807, Further evidence and data collection networks, particularly in the Americas, are needed for establishing definitive guidelines and recommendations.
32452739, Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (P < .05).
32452739, Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread.Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 μm under surgical conditions.
32452739, During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing.
32452739, Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.
32452050, SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction.
32452050, There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered.
32452050, Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic.
32452050, In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

32451162, The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers.Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer.
32451162, Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting.

32448757, Consequently, diagnostic cardiovascular evaluations such as echocardiography are a crucial part of the disease management.
32448757, On the other hand, providing safety for the patients and the healthcare personnel is a matter of great concern in the pandemic state.

32448333, Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers.This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy.
32448333, Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay.
32448333, Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery.
32448333, A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations.
32448136, The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically.There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05).
32448136, In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05).
32448136, However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05).
32448136, The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group.CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.
32447742, It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32447742, Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32447742, Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
32447742, Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32447328, Conclusions This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2.
32447328, The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.
32446902, Envelope sequences alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated virus specimens; while the structural mapping of epitopes resulted in the interesting maintenance of the structural folding and epitope sequence localization also in the envelope proteins scoring a lower alignment score.
32446902, In line with the One-Health approach, our evidences provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role of taxonomically related coronaviruses in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.Copyright © 2020 Institut Pasteur.

32446538, The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic.
32446538, In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.Copyright © 2020 IMSS.

32446305, The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever.
32446305, Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19.
32446305, Children with TB are a vulnerable group especially likely to suffer as part of the "collateral damage". There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TB-HIV, and this will require unpicking.
32446305, Lessons for COVID-19 could be learned from the vast experience of running global TB control programmes, while the astonishingly rapid and relatively well co-ordinated response to COVID-19 demonstrates how existing programmes could be significantly improved.
32445165, We consider two different clinical settings, where availability of the different diagnostic strategies differs widely: outpatient and inpatient.
32445165, Our reasoning highlights how challenging a balanced approach to a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms can be.
32445165, At present, clinical workup of COVID-19 remains a hard task to accomplish.
32445165, However, knowledge of the natural history of the disease may aid the internist in putting common and unspecific symptoms into the correct clinical context.
32444412, Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features.
32444412, Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system.In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86).
32444412, Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014).
32444412, Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32443856, In addition, the advent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in high disease burdened low and middle income countries (LMICs) has increased the need for robust EHIS to enable efficient surveillance of the pandemic.
32443856, EHIS has potential to enable efficient delivery of disease diagnostics services at point-of-care (POC) and reduce medical errors.
32443856, This review provides an overview of literature on EHIS's with a focus on describing the key components of EHIS and presenting evidence on enablers and barriers to implementation of EHISs in LMICs.
32443856, With guidance from the presented evidence, we proposed EHIS key stakeholders' roles and responsibilities to ensure efficient utility of EHIS for disease diagnosis and management at POC in LMICs.
32443459, To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results.
32443459, Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32443459, Based on ten studies, we computed a pooled sensitivity of 64.8% (95%CI 54.5-74.0), and specificity of 98.0% (95%CI 95.8-99.0), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias.
32443459, We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.
32443442, Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts.
32443442, The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients.
32443442, Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean ± standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.1, 0.86 ± 0.16 and 0.80 ± 0.1 and a receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.79 ± 0.1.
32443442, The need for ICU treatment is independently associated with affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP, and IL-6.
32443202, While incineration, chemical disinfection, and physical disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastes disinfection.
32443202, In addition, considering the characteristics of various hospital wastes, the classification and selection of corresponding disinfection technologies are discussed.
32443202, On this basis, this study provides scientific suggestions for management, technology selection, and operation of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection in China, which is of great significance for development of national disinfection strategy for hospital wastes and wastewater during COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32442030, CONCLUSION.
32442030, The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.
32441935, The analytical sensitivity of the RT-RAA assay was 10 copies for the S and one copy for the orf1ab gene per reaction.
32441935, Cross-reactions were not observed with any of the other respiratory pathogens.
32441935, A hundred percent agreement between the RT-RAA and real-time PCR assays was accomplished after testing 120 respiratory specimens.
32441935, These results demonstrate that the proposed RT-RAA assay will be beneficial as it is a faster, more sensitive, and more specific tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
32441380, Diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is suboptimal, and some procedural mistakes may account for it.The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner.We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx.
32441380, Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions.
32441380, Regards OPS, gentle anterior tongue depression should be used to avoid swab contamination from the oral cavity during collection of secretions from the posterior pharyngeal wall.
32441380, These procedural tricks would enhance diagnostic reliability.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32440883, Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients.
32440883, Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience.
32440883, The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19.
32440883, We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.
32439651, Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%.The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high.
32439651, However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19.
32439651, The positive predictive value is poor.
32439651, Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.© 2020 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.
32438945, Diagnostic challenges, the effect of phone consultation on the therapeutic alliance, challenges associated with the use of technology and ethical concerns were identified as issues.
32438945, Flexibility in the working day and convenience were identified as possible benefits to telephone consultations.The group who participated in this research study identified a number of challenges to carrying out successful phone consultations.
32438945, This study highlights the need at our clinical site for interventions to address the issues identified by staff.
32438945, The findings also highlight the requirement for larger studies with stronger methodologies to determine the generalisability of our results.
32438898, The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships.
32438898, The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports.
32438898, Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases.
32438898, Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.© Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.
32438868, According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR reports were detected as positive by ddPCR.
32438868, The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively.
32438868, Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR, which still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 5-12 days post discharge.
32438868, Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.
32438677, IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms.
32438677, Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone.
32438677, All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic.
32438677, LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.
32438345, Indeed, while thyroid nodules are very common, only a small percentage are cancerous and, in turn, most thyroid cancers are indolent in nature.
32438345, Accordingly, diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules, thyroid surgery for either benign or malignant thyroid nodules and radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers may be safely postponed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32438345, Appropriate patient counselling, however, is mandatory and red flags should be carefully identified prompting immediate evaluation and treatment as appropriate.
32438345, For these selected cases diagnostic work-up (e.g. ultrasound, scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration), surgery and radioiodine therapy may proceed despite the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, after an individual risk-benefit analysis.
32438340, Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves' ophthalmopathy.
32438340, Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication.
32438340, The usual advice to increase dosage of levothyroxine during pregnancy should be adhered to.
32438340, Many newly presenting and previously diagnosed patients with thyroid dysfunction can be managed through virtual telephone or video clinics supported by a dedicated nurse-led service, depending on available facilities.
32438256, To compare the detection rate, we reviewed numerous literature on pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and analyzed two different ways of diagnosis.
32438256, The results showed that the detection rate of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis was significantly higher than that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (P = 0.00697).
32438256, Still, clinicians should combine radiology and laboratory methods to achieve a higher detection rate, so that instant isolation and treatment could be effectively conducted to curb the rampant spread of the epidemic.Copyright © 2020.

32437124, The thiol-modified ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance.
32437124, Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA-DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs.
32437124, The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/μL of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load.
32437124, Thus, the current study reports a selective and visual "naked-eye" detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, without the requirement of any sophisticated instrumental techniques.
32436845, Eight studies presented independent test data, 5 used disclosed data, and 4 disclosed the AI source codes.
32436845, The number of datasets ranged from 106 to 5941, with sensitivities ranging from 0.67-1.00 and specificities ranging from 0.81-1.00 for prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32436845, Four studies with independent test datasets showed a breakdown of the data ratio and reported prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC).
32436845, These 4 studies showed very high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, in the range of 0.9-0.98, 0.91-0.96, and 0.96-0.99, respectively.
32436441,Based on observations described in our letter, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) anosmia must imperatively be added to the list of specific symptoms of COVID-19 infection, (2) anosmia can serve as a free and specific diagnostic tool for developing countries currently affected by the pandemic, (3) the mechanisms of COVID-19 anosmia seem not to directly involve nasal obstruction but rather seem to be related to damage the olfactory neuroepithelium.
32436355, Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (i.e. the neutrophil count, LDH and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count.
32436355, Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels.
32436355, A steep increase of both ICU transfer or mortality risk was observed in men with TT<5 nmol/L or cFT< 100 pmol/L.Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected men admitted to RICU.This article is protected by copyright.

32435872, Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms facilitate the translation to PoC settings via the miniaturization, portability, integration, and automation of multiple assay functions onto a single chip.
32435872, For this purpose, paper-based assays and microfluidic platforms are currently being extensively studied, and much focus is being directed towards simplifying their design while simultaneously improving multiplexing and automation capabilities.
32435872, Signal amplification strategies are being applied to improve the performance of assays with respect to both sensitivity and selectivity, while smartphones are being integrated to expand the analytical power of the technology and promote its accessibility.
32435872, In this chapter, we review the main technologies in the field of LoC platforms for PoC medical diagnostics and survey recent approaches for improving these assays.
32434888, The virus replicated in ciliated cells and was released apically.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020.
32434888, At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds.
32434888, While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells.

32434706, Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value <30).
32434706, However, for Ct values >30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert.While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations.

32434339, There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85 %), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37 %).
32434339, There was only one PCR positive subject.
32434339, Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals.
32434339, This article shows the pitfalls of the testing methods and highlights the necessity of using a correct testing algorithm, considering the character of the tested population and the expected low prevalence.
32433248, The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care.
32433248, The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics.
32433248, Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount.
32433248, Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.
32433217, This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity.
32433217, Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
32433217, The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
32433217, Furthermore, solutions for enhancing international strategies in translational research, cooperative networks and regulatory partnerships are contemplated.
32432217, Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen.
32432217, Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system.
32432217, A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection.
32432217, In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).
32431287, Public health policies aimed at preventing new COVID-19 cases were very effective in halting the pandemic in Thailand.
32431287, Case fatality in Thailand has been low (1.7%), at least in part due to early stratification according to risk of disease severity and timely initiation of supportive care with affordable measures.
32431287, We present our initial experience with COVID-19 in Thailand, focusing on several aspects that may have played a crucial role in curtailment of the pandemic, and elements of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients, including stratification, isolation, and affordable diagnostic approaches and supportive care measures.
32431287, We also discuss local considerations concerning some proposed experimental treatments.
32429249, This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
32429249, With ongoing treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients other questions will come up.
32429249, While respective guidelines on these topics will serve clinicians in clinical practice, regularly updating all guidelines concerning COVID-19 will be a necessary, although challenging task in the upcoming weeks and months.
32429249, All recommendations during the current extremely rapid development of knowledge must be evaluated on a daily basis, as suggestions made today may be out-dated with the new evidence available tomorrow.
32429101,In this report, updated information and future perspectives about the use of saliva as a sample for laboratory analysis of the Covid-19 are highlighted.
32429101, Saliva can be used for the direct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the quantification of the specific immunoglobulins produced against it, and for the evaluation of the non-specific, innate immune response of the patient.
32429101, Moreover, a deeper knowledge of potential changes in the saliva proteome in this disease may allow the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, or even help our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the disease.
32429101, With the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays, saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis, disease management, and control of Covid-19.
32427569, HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members.
32427569, Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., "already protected", the ones in the acute phase, i.e., "the infectious", and the virus-naive, i.e., "at risk" workers.
32427569, Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

32427216, All patients undergo a clinical and virologic diagnostic process before admittance and receive psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care, possibly beginning under quarantine conditions.
32427216, Furthermore, appropriate general hygiene regulations are explained.
32427216, Finally, what the patients are told is illustrated using a simple schematic aid: distance (minimum 2 m), rubbing (wash hands with soap often and for at least 20 s), avoidance (pass by in a friendly manner), alternative communication, forsaking (shopping is not always necessary), wiping (regularly wipeing of all surfaces by the cleaning personnel as well as tablet and mobile telephone by the patients themselves) and outside activity as much as possible, alone or sitting together (with safety distance).

32427166, By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression.
32427166, These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19.

32427000, Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter, and 76% of all studies were single-center.Conclusion: Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy.
32427000, Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.
32426111, It is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with "exposure risk" to COVID-19 for patients coming to clinic or the hospital.
32426111, If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation.
32426111, However, the COVID-19 outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work-up including potential exposure to COVID-19 versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high-risk, high likelihood World Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.
32426111, This document will highlight some of the issues facing providers, patients, and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in real-time as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and is intended to share expected common clinical scenarios and best clinical practices to help the community at-large.© The Author(s) 2020.
32425657, In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.To determine the analytical performance of the ID NOW assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.Residual NP samples collected in viral transport media were tested by the ID NOW platform in two independent laboratories.
32425657, Results were compared to either the CDC or New York EUA assays, which served as reference methods.Overall agreement of ID NOW was 78.7%. Sensitivity was 71.7% and specificity was 100%. Notably, all false-negative results correlated to those samples that were weakly positive.ID NOW performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has reduced sensitivity for weakly positive samples.
32425657, This sensitivity, among other concerns, should be taken into consideration when using this test for patients with a low suspicion for COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32425251, This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.
32425251, The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.

32425183, In this phase, it is crucial to minimize the risk of infection to limit COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality and the number of new cases.
32425183, Indeed, COVID-19 manifestations may be equivocal, including asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.
32425183, In order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare providers, therefore, it is mandatory to stratify the risk of post-COVID-19 pandemic infection during the clinical and instrumental evaluation of cardiac patients, who are at low risk for COVID-19.
32425183, Here we discuss the most common diagnostic procedures and therapeutic activities, the type of personal protective equipment according to the different tests, the timetable of the different diagnostic examinations, the tele-health services or alternative strategies, and the structural and management requirements, that should be applied to protect patients and healthcare providers in the post-COVID-19 era.
32425014, In patients with COVID-19, the full cardiovascular disease diagnostic algorithm can be hindered by logistic restrain mainly derived from the difficulty of transporting patients in critical conditions to Radiology or Hemodynamics wards.
32425014, The echocardiography in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can help for differential diagnosis of cardiac events, which can be related or unrelated by the infection and can likely impact on short-term prognosis.
32425014, Indeed, transthoracic echocardiography plays a key role in the screen for CV complications of COVID-19 infection: it must be focused cardiac ultrasound study (FoCUS) performed at bedside.
32425014, All transthoracic, transesophageal and stress echocardiograms in patients in which test results are unlikely to change the management strategy should be postponed.
32423899, Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.© Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32423299, However, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, DFL represents a high-risk procedure for patients and otolaryngologists due to the risk of aerosolization.
32423299, In cases where DFL is required, in patients with COVID-19 positivity or unknown COVID-19 status, we describe the use of a modified endoscopy face mask as an adjunct to personal protection equipment to reduce occupational transmission of COVID-19 while performing DFL.
32423299, Our modified endoscopy mask provides an additional barrier against the transmission of airborne pathogens.
32423299, The modified endoscopy face mask may also serve as a useful tool for otolaryngologists as they return to performing more aerosol-generating procedures in the outpatient setting.
32423298,Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery underwent drastic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32423298, Since March 10, the first day of the lockdown in Italy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergency and oncology cases, while outpatient procedures and clinical examinations were temporarily suspended to limit virus diffusion and to reallocate personnel into wards dedicated to COVID-19.
32423298, In our otolaryngology unit, between March 10 and April 28, 2020, we performed 96 surgical procedures; they mainly consisted in diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors of the head and neck (77%), management of acute upper airway obstruction in adults and children (14.7%), drainage of abscesses of the head and neck (6.2%), and treatment of nasal bone fractures (2.1%).
32423298, When comparing these data with those of the same period in 2019 for emergency and oncology procedures, we noticed a drastic reduction of head and neck abscesses and nasal bone fractures, while oncology surgery remained stable.
32422662, Among 84 patients who were initially classified as "outpatients", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days.
32422662, Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19.

32420939, As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease.
32420939, Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection.
32420939, We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function.
32420939, This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.
32420937, Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed.
32420937, First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels.
32420937, The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.
32420937, Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far.
32420937, As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.
32420937, Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis.
32420937, The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.

32419639, The diagnostic potential of these two types of specimens were showed significant difference (positive rate: 78.2% on throat swabs vs. 52.6% on anal swabs, McNemar Test P=0.0091) and exhibited a weak positive consistency (Kappa value was 0.311, P<0.0001) in pediatric patients.
32419639, Furthermore, viral loads detected on both throat and anal swabs also showed no significant difference (P = 0.9511) and correlation (Pearson r = 0.0434, P = 0.8406), and exhibited an inconsistent kinetic change through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32419639, Besides, viral loads in the throat and anal swabs were correlated with different types of immune states, immune-reactive phase, and the resolution phase/immunologic tolerance, respectively.
32419639, These findings revealed that RT-PCR-testing on throat and anal swabs showed significant difference for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlated with different immune state in pediatric patients.

32415767, The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis.
32415767, Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists.
32415767, In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease.
32415767, Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder‑based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ‑of ‑the ‑art cardiovascular services.
32415585, After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively).
32415585, In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%.Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation.
32415585, However, the specificity is low.
32415585, In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.• Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.

32413984, Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability.
32413984, Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences.
32413984, We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively.
32413984, Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32412790, CONCLUSION.
32412790, CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32412790, Chest CT should be considered a supplemental diagnostic tool, particularly for patients who show symptoms.
32412509, Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated.
32412509, The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited.
32412509, Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results.
32412509, Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
32411619, The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations.
32411619, In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs.
32411619, The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings.

32411552, The current diagnostic options include real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a few serology tests, including but not limited to the recently approved five minutes serology tests.
32411552, The disease presents as a lower respiratory tract illness.
32411552, Anecdotal experiences have shown that imaging characteristics are crucial to diagnosis as radiological evidence of disease appears prior to clinical manifestations and tends to evolve over time, which can be useful in predicting the stage of the disease.

32407306, The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32407306, Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death.
32407306, Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5).
32407306, Reporting of excess deaths might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.
32406638, The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased.
32406638, Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels.
32406638, We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings.In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans.
32406638, Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as 'proven COVID-19 patients' using the algorithm.
32406374, The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache.
32406374, This article is a narrative review with the aim of analyzing the current literature on postviral olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.
32406374, Since the initial anecdotal reports from China, international reports on COVID-19 patients have been increasing, describing a 5% to 85% range of loss of smell.
32406374, To date, the literature is widely heterogeneous regarding the loss of smell; therefore, we advise home isolation measures and/or social distancing, and to carry out diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 when possible in those patients with sudden and severe loss of smell who cannot be promptly evaluated.

32404896, All patients recovered gradually.Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population.
32404896, Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity.
32404896, The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected.
32404896, This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
32404797, To overcome the limitations of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab, especially oscillating sensitivity, we added the information obtained from phone calls to discharged patients with negative initial RT-PCR.
32404797, Thus, we included 535 patients with concomitant CXR and RT-PCR on admission (aged 65±17 y; 340 males, 195 females), resulting in 408 RT-PCR positive and 127 negative patients at the composite reference standard.
32404797, Original CXR reports showed an 89.0% sensitivity (95% confidence intervals [CI], 85.5%-91.8%), 60.6% specificity (95% CI, 51.6%-69.2%), 87.9% positive predictive value (95% CI, 84.4%-90.9%), and 63.1% negative predictive value (95% CI, 53.9%-71.7%).
32404797, The adoption of CXR alongside RT-PCR to triage patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a safe and efficient workflow, counteracting possible false negative RT-PCR results.
32404786, The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days.
32404786, There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment.
32404786, All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.
32404786, RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.
32404482, COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, reducing the bacteremia rate to 1.6% when excluded.
32404482, More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation.
32404482, Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial co-infection.
32404482, Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during patient surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days, if necessary, to free additional capacity.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32404481, Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures.
32404481, Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform.
32404481, VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature.

32404302, Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
32404302, In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
32404302, Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
32403995, Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains.
32403995, Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.
32403995, Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2.
32403995, Thus, we aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic antibodies as well as diagnostics.
32403176, Therefore, front-line operations, such as emergency departments (ED), were highly stressed by immediate demand for diagnostic swab-testing, and additional personnel were urgently needed within a short time.
32403176, In the meantime, clinical activities of medical students (MS) were on hold, and teaching had to be restructured to online formats.
32403176, However, we expected that MS would benefit tremendously from learning opportunities through active involvement in this pandemic.This article is protected by copyright.

32402061, Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative.
32402061, The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3d, 25.0% (95% CI; 8.66-49.10) at 3-7d, 56.5% (95% CI; 34.49-76.81) at 3-7d and 85.4% (95% CI; 72.24-93.93) at ≥14d if borderline results were considered positive.
32402061, The qualitative concordance between the assays was 0.83 (95% CI; 0.75-0.91).The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the EI assay.
32402061, However, diagnostic sensitivity was poor in both assays during the first 14 days of symptoms.© 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
32401550, Local hospitals and care facilities are turning to makers to print essential consumable parts, such as simple visors, while in the hardest hit areas, critical pieces of medical technology are being fabricated.
32401550, While important and effective innovations are appearing almost daily, there are also some worrying trends towards hobbyists attempting manufacture of complex medical devices with little understanding of the clinical or scientific rationale behind their design.
32401550, The nature of the open-source community, an area of intensive innovation, fluidity, and experimentation, jars with the exacting standards of medical device regulation.
32401550, Here, we review the involvement of rapid prototyping and the open-source community in the key areas of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostics, critical care technology, and information acquisition and sharing, highlighting where makers and hackers have clashed with medical device regulations, and areas where the system has worked well to facilitate change.
32401064, The current outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) illustrated difficulties in lack of effective drugs for treatment.
32401064, Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for early recognition and treatment of infectious diseases, allowing timely implementation of infection control, improved clinical care and other public health measures to stop the spread of the disease.
32401064, CRISPR-Cas technology speed up the development of infectious disease diagnostics with high rapid and accurate.
32401064, In this review, we summarise current advance regarding diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, in the development of fast, accurate and portable diagnostic tests and highlight the potential of CRISPR-Cas13 in COVID-19 Pneumonia and other emerging infectious diseases diagnosis.
32400924, With contributions from the leadership of the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), Children's Oncology Group (COG), St Jude Global program, and Childhood Cancer International, we have sought to provide a framework for healthcare teams caring for children with cancer during the pandemic.
32400924, We anticipate the burden will fall particularly heavily on children, their families, and cancer services in low- and middle-income countries.
32400924, Therefore, we have brought together the relevant clinical leads from SIOP Europe, COG, and SIOP-PODC (Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) to focus on the six most curable cancers that are part of the WHO Global Initiative in Childhood Cancer.
32400924, We provide some practical advice for adapting diagnostic and treatment protocols for children with cancer during the pandemic, the measures taken to contain it (e.g., extreme social distancing), and how to prepare for the anticipated recovery period.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32400049, Two patients conservatively treated died.
32400049, The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6.
32400049, ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support.Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients.
32400049, Complete patient history and examination, routine ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and careful evaluation of changes in cardiac enzymes should be part of the regular assessment procedures also in dedicated COVID positive units.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32399942, Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the COVID-19 crisis.
32399942, How can we best adapt as physicians and surgeons? What foundational ethical principles and systems of principle application can help guide our decision-making? Fortunately, a large body of work in medical ethics addresses these questions.
32399942, Unfortunately, many surgeons and other health care professionals are probably not as familiar with these concepts.
32399942, This brief communication is intended to provide a concise explanation of ethical considerations which readers may find helpful when addressing allocation of scarce resources and alterations in surgical care brought on by the current pandemic.
32399755, Currently, COVID-19 represents a health emergency worldwide, leading, in severe cases, to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction or failure, and death.
32399755, In the context of limited scientific knowledge and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, guidance is becoming increasingly necessary for pathologists who have to perform postmortem investigations on COVID-19 cases.
32399755, The aim of the present report is to share a procedure applicable to cases of COVID-19-related death, particularly in cases of death without medical intervention and in the absence of an ascertained SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 diagnosis, therefore providing support for diagnostic activity in the present COVID-19 pandemic.
32399755, For this purpose, a standard operating procedure for correct swab collection, autopsy investigation and tissue sampling is provided.
32399515, We speculate that while African nations are currently experiencing much lower rates of COVID-19 relative to other continents, their significantly lower testing rates may grossly underestimate incidence rates.
32399515, Failure to grasp the true picture may mean crucial windows of opportunity shut unutilized, while limited resources are not deployed to maximum effect.
32399515, In the absence of extensive testing data, an overestimation of spread may lead to disproportionate measures being taken, causing avoidable strain on livelihoods and economies.
32399515, Here, based on the African situation, we discuss COVID-19 diagnostic challenges and how they may blunt responses.Copyright: © 2020 Kobia F and Gitaka J.
32398954, CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human deaths worldwide.
32398954, Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020.
32398954, Its risks and pandemic potential have brought global consideration.
32398954, We summarized epidemiology, virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.© The author(s).
32398918, There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out.
32398918, As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling "definitely stressed out" increased.
32398918, Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the "definitely stressed out" group.The psychological impact of the lockdown during COVID 19 on orthopaedic surgeons may become a potential concern that will require addressal through open discussion.diagnostic level 4.© 2020 Delhi Orthopedic Association.

32398273, We provide 106 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured' regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA.
32398273, We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the extended 5' UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3' UTR.
32398273, Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome that have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains.
32398273, These 59 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured' genomic regions may be most easily targeted in primer-based diagnostic and oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.
32397951, In conclusion, this review may provide useful information to develop some strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
32397688, The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32397688, To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
32397688, Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
32397688, Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.
32397487,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global ongoing pandemic.
32397487, Timely, accurate and non-invasive SARS-CoV-2 detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, as well as determination of their immune status, will facilitate effective large-scale pandemic control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32397487, Saliva is a biofluid whose anatomical source and location is of particularly strategic relevance to COVID-19 transmission and monitoring.
32397487, This review focuses on the role of saliva as both a foe (a common mode of viral transmission via salivary droplets and potentially aerosols) and a friend (as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for viral detection and immune status surveillance) in combating COVID-19.
32396550, Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses.
32396550, Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%).
32396550, Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7-22.9).
32396550, As influenza A and B viruses were commonly associated with SARI and are treatable, SARI patients entering these hospitals would benefit if the hospitals were able to adapt onsite molecular diagnostics.
32396505, All assays performed comparably with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretions, serum, and fecal specimens spiked with cultured virus.
32396505, We obtained no false-positive amplifications with other human coronaviruses or common respiratory pathogens.
32396505, Results from all 3 assays were highly correlated during clinical specimen testing.
32396505, On February 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of this panel.
32395964,COVID-19 is associated with a high prevalence of activation of the coagulation cascade.
32395964, It has been suggested that this so-called COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is predictive of a poor outcome and of mortality.
32395964, Consensus documents on how to manage patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are based on the limited number of mainly retrospective studies that is currently available, and for this reason the recommendations are not always consistent with one another.
32395964, In this article, we review the first studies into COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and give the most important do's and don'ts for diagnostics and the daily management of coagulopathy and the prevention of complications in patients with, or with strongly-suspected, COVID-19 in Dutch clinical practice.
32395793, Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests.
32395793, Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management.
32395793, The detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is better used for epidemiological analyses.
32395793, Research should be encouraged to overcome the limits of the currently available diagnostic tests.
32395673, Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32395673, Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
32395673, This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.
32395673, We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.© 2020 The Author(s).
32395494, The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DenseNet model and radiologist were also calculated.The DenseNet algorithm model yielded an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.958-1.0) in the validation set and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.972-0.995) in the test set.
32395494, The threshold value was selected as 0.8, while for validation and test sets, the accuracies were 95% and 92%, the sensitivities were 100% and 97%, the specificities were 90% and 87%, and the F1 values were 95% and 93%, respectively.
32395494, The sensitivity of radiologist was 94%, the specificity was 96%, while the accuracy was 95%.Deep learning (DL) with DenseNet can accurately classify COVID-19 on HRCT with an AUC of 0.98, which can reduce the miss diagnosis rate (combined with radiologists' evaluation) and radiologists' workload.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32393447, The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic.
32393447, In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications.
32393447, In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

32393438, The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify.
32393438, Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type.
32393438, It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.
32393438, The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.© 2020, Zhou et al.
32391662, The results of magnetic bead method for nucleic acid extraction by two different extractors (Sansure Natch CS S12C Fully Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System vs.
32391662, Tianlong NP968-C Nucleic Acid Extractor) were also compared.The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and kappa value were 95.00%, 87.50%, 95.00%, 87.50%and 0.825 for Sansure kit; 90.00%, 87.50%, 94.74%, 77.78%and 0.747 for the Bioperfectus kit, and 82.50%, 81.25%, 91.67%, 65.00%and 0.593 for the BGI kit, respectively.
32391662, The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods were 95.24%, 100.00%, 96.43%and 0.909, respectively, but the one-step cleavage method took only 25 min, while the magnetic bead method required 180 min.
32391662, The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by the two different nucleic acid extractors were 85.00%, 100.00%, 89.29% and 0.764, respectively.The detection efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by the Sansure kit is relatively higher and the one-step cleavage method has advantages of convenient operation and less time consuming.
32391242, Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases.
32391242, Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) were increased in severe patients.
32391242, These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation.Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out.
32391242, Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
32391234, Even though end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and can develop severe to critical disease, there are limited studies and case reports about COVID-19 in ESRD patients.
32391234, We report a case of a 63-year-old gentleman with ESRD on regular hemodialysis.
32391234, We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment.
32391234, He positively responded to a 14-day course of Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Ribavirin, Azithromycin, and Hydroxychloroquine.Copyright © 2020, Alalwan et al.
32390523, The Healthcare System's Administration communicated to all personnel the implementation of a planned 'biological risk protocol' at the Covid-19 hospital, while the Covid-19-free hospital followed regular government recommendations.
32390523, We evaluated the risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients treated for surgical or invasive urologic procedures during the epidemic in the two different hospitals.At the Covid-19 hospital, 12 patients underwent surgery and 51 patients invasive diagnostic procedures between 22 February and 8 March 2020; in the same period, at the Covid-19-free hospital, 21 patients underwent surgery and 56 patients invasive diagnostic procedures.
32390523, We compared the incidence of Sars-Cov-2 infection among the patients who were accessed in the two Urology Units in the period of different restrictive measures after the outbreak of the epidemic.We registered no cases of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients hospitalized in that period in Covid-19 hospital, despite three cases of swab positivity in the Covid-19-free hospital.The early implementation of extraordinary measures to restrict the spread of the virus offers a good protection also in a Covid-19 referral Hospital.
32390523, The adoption of safety measures may be considered even after the end of the pandemic in all the health systems.
32389784, In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections.
32389784, Thus, immunochromatographic tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have their place for the diagnostic panel of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The British Infection Association.

32388698, A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset.
32388698, The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists.
32388698, These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology.
32388698, Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.
32388471, Positive and negative agreement were 100 % and 99.2 % respectively.
32388471, Invalid-rate was 6.3 %.The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay.
32388471, Due to its random-access workflow concept and rapid time-to-result of about 80 min, the system is very well suited for providing fast-tracked SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32387968, Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG.
32387968, The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19.

32386018,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted extensive attention all around the world recently.
32386018, Early screening, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment remain the most effective prevention and control measures.
32386018, Computed tomography (CT) plays a vital role in the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of COVID-19, especially in the early screening, with a higher sensitivity than that of real-time fluorescence RT-PCR.
32386018, The combination of CT and artificial intelligence has the potential to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency.
32386012, The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested.There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination.
32386012, Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19.
32386012, The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign.
32386012, In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942.The standardized imaging diagnosis report mode based on COVID-19 chest image features is effective and practical, which should be popularized.
32385976, However, with predominant respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases, chest imaging using computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in detecting viral lung infection, evaluating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions, and monitoring the disease activity.
32385976, The role of chest CT as a diagnostic tool may be increased when the laboratory testing capacities using RT-PCR prove inaccurate or insufficient during a major outbreak of the disease.
32385976, In these settings, a rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 potentially offered by CT might be an advantage, in addition to obvious benefits of delineating the nature and extent of pulmonary changes.
32385976, In the present paper, we reviewed the diagnostic role of chest CT in COVID-19 patients.
32385648, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively.
32385648, CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation.There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation.
32385648, An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes.
32385648, Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis.• The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions. • An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome. • Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.
32384153, To validate the assay against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total viral RNA derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 positive and 11 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were screened.
32384153, All results were compared to established RT-qPCR assays.The 95% detection probability of the RT-RPA assay was determined to be 7.74 (95% CI: 2.87 - 27.39) RNA copies per reaction.
32384153, The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance.
32384153, The developed RT-RPA assay produced 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to RT-qPCR (n=20).With a run time of 15 to 20 minutes and first results being available in under 7 minutes for high RNA concentrations, the reported assay constitutes one of the fastest nucleic acid based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to date and may provide a simple to use alternative to RT-qPCR for first-line screening at the point of need.© 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
32384019, Conclusions An AI system for detection of COVID-19 on chest radiographs was comparable to six independent readers.
32383370, Their prevalence was significantly more common among females and younger individuals (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively).
32383370, Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks.
32383370, The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms.
32383370, Anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of the disease.© 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.
32383254, Positive, borderline, and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different methods of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer).
32383254, Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner.
32383254, Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.© 2020 The Authors.

32382463, Clinicians should be aware that rhabdomyolysis can be an initial presentation of COVID-19 or can occur at any time during the disease course.
32382463, Patients with rhabdomyolysis should receive aggressive fluid administration to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI).
32382463, However, COVID-19 patients are at risk of worsening oxygenation and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from fluid overload.
32382463, Therefore, cautious fluid administration is needed in COVID-19 patients with rhabdomyolysis.Copyright © 2020, Suwanwongse et al.
32382449, In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.
32382449, The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.© 2020 THE AUTHORS.

32381643, Cohen's kappa analysis rated the strength of agreement between the two platforms as "almost perfect" (κ = 0.922; standard error, 0.051).
32381643, Furthermore, there was no significant difference between corresponding cycle threshold values generated on the two systems (P value = 0.88; Student's t test).
32381643, Taken together, these data imply both platforms can be considered comparable in terms of their clinical performance.

32381642, In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA.
32381642, Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting.
32381642, Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests.
32381642, Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32381641, We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity.
32381641, Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort.
32381641, We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.

32381140, Hospitals, specialties, and professional groups are spurring one another on to adopt progressively more aggressive measures in response to COVID-19 that often exceed federal and international standards.
32381140, Examples include universal masking of providers and patients; decreasing thresholds to test asymptomatic patients; using face shields and N95 respirators regardless of symptoms and test results; novel additions to the list of aerosol-generating procedures; and more comprehensive personal protective equipment including hair, shoe, and leg covers.
32381140, Here, we review the factors underlying this arms race, including fears about personal safety, ongoing uncertainty around how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, confusion about what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure, increasing recognition of the importance of asymptomatic infection, and the limited accuracy of diagnostic tests.
32381140, We consider the detrimental effects of a maximal infection control approach and the research studies that are needed to eventually de-escalate hospitals and to inform more evidence-based and measured strategies.
32380844, This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as "When is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?" or "How should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?" This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided.
32380844, Proposed reporting language is also outlined based on this structure.
32380844, As our understanding of this pandemic evolves, our appreciation for how imaging fits into the workup of patients during this unprecedented time evolves as well.
32380844, Although this consensus statement was written using the most recent literature, it is important to maintain an open mind as new information continues to surface.
32380453, There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
32380453, Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life.
32380453, As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32379727, During 2016-2020, Kenya's DaRRE partners (CDC, the Kenya Ministry of Health [MoH], and Kenya's county public health officials) conceptualized, planned, and implemented key components of DaRRE.
32379727, Activities were selected based on existing capacity and determined by the Kenya MoH and included 1) expansion of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance sites; 2) piloting of community event-based surveillance; 3) expansion of laboratory diagnostic capacity; 4) training of public health practitioners in detection, investigation, and response to respiratory threats; and 5) improvement of response capacity by the national emergency operations center (EOC).
32379727, Progress on DaRRE activity implementation was assessed throughout the process.
32379727, This pilot in Kenya demonstrated that DaRRE can support IHR requirements and can capitalize on a country's existing resources by tailoring tools to improve public health preparedness based on countries' needs.
32379077, While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations.
32379077, Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there are a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings.
32379077, A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations.
32379077, We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.
32378729, An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined.
32378729, More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
32378729, Herewith, presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.
32378729, Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.
32378459, Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses.
32378459, There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among these, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples.
32378459, This article aims to provide an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of nanoparticles as diagnostic or antiviral tools against coronaviruses.
32378459, The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors in this field are also presented.
32377597, Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19.
32377597, Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization.
32377597, Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field.As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
32377597, We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.© 2020 The Author(s).
32377507,There remains diagnostic uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal specimens.

32376700, The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], ±1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, ±3.70%).IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds.
32376700, This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds.
32376700, These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations.
32376700, Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.Copyright © 2020 Mora-Díaz et al.
32376581, Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19.
32376581, The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19.The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05).
32376581, The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05).
32376581, Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.An increased NLR can serve as an early warning signal of severe COVID-19.
32375787, However, despite such efforts, the number of cases and deaths has progressively increased with rising trends in total confirmed cases and deaths, as well as in new daily cases and deaths associated with the COVID-19.
32375787, Iran is a developing country and its economic infrastructure has been hit hardly by embargo and sanctions.
32375787, While developed countries have allocated appropriate funding and are responding adequately to the COVID-19 pandemics, Iran has experienced a serious surge of cases and deaths and should strive to provide additional resources to the health system to make healthcare services more accessible and to increase the fairness of that access.
32375787, All relevant actors and stakeholders should work together to fight this disease.
32374942, A customized Excel Data Tool was created, trialed across professional groups and made freely available for download at www.entintegrate.co.uk/entuk2wwtt, alongside a user guide, protocol, and registration link for the project.
32374942, Stakeholder support was obtained from national bodies.No remote consultations were refused by patients.

32374647, In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure.
32374647, We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols.
32374647, A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist.
32374647, At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.
32374545,The nasopharyngeal smear with PCR analysis is the first diagnostic test proposed to confirm infection with COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2.
32374545, However, its usefulness in emergency centers is limited due to its imperfect sensitivity (56-83 %), limited availability and the time required to obtain results.
32374545, For this reason, the chest CT-scan has been proposed as a rapid triage tool for diagnosis in these suspect Covid-19 patients.
32374545, However, its specificity is limited, exposing to the risk of over-diagnosis, and further data are needed to confirm its usefulness, and to highlight the possible prognostic value of the CT, in detecting early lesions associated with poor outcome, indicating the need for admission to intensive care.
32374537,Since its emergence in December 2019, scientific knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved rapidly but, due to the complexity and novelty of this infection and its political and economic stakes, much remains to be clarified.
32374537, Thousands of studies have already been published and scientific research is constantly evolving.
32374537, In this multitude of information, we offer an update of the knowledge currently available.
32374537, A limitation of the propagation, the understanding of the functioning of the virus and its clinical manifestations, the administration of specific treatments, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are the basis of the fight against this germ, which is still little known today.
32374208, First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers.
32374208, If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created.
32374208, Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients.
32374208, Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance.
32374007,To summarize the current practice and potential strategy in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).PubMed, Web of Science were systematically searched using terms including "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" and "2019-nCoV". After removing duplicates, we then identified articles, letters and commentaries regarding diagnosing COVID-19.Here we summarized relatively mature diagnostic methods like nuclear acid test and computed tomography.
32374007, Besides, new aspects regarding these detection methods like suitable specimens for nuclear acid test, possible use of 18F-FDG PET/CT were also reported.
32374007, Especially, we also presented several novel techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 like lung ultrasound.Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) by National Health Commission is recommended to follow as it provides detailed diagnostic procedures using currently available tools.
32374007, We suggest clinicians further explore the saliva's utility as a specimen for nuclear acid test and the use of lung ultrasound.
32374001, Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms "2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test" were used.
32374001, As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
32374001, We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
32374001, All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
32374000, Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control.
32374000, However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics.
32374000, Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development.
32374000, In this review, we focus on our current understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapeutics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

32370561, Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies.
32370561, A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients.
32370561, Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity.
32370561, Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.
32369770, Here, we summarize some of the diagnostic and management dilemmas for these patients, and we provide guidance on safe and as effective as possible delivery of care in the COVID-19 era.
32369770, We also attempt to address how pituitary services should be remodelled in the event of similar crises, while maintaining or even improving patient outcomes.
32369770, Regular review of these recommendations and further adjustments are needed, depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic status.
32369770, We consider that utilization of successful models of pituitary multidisciplinary care implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should continue after the crisis is over by using the valuable and exceptional experience gained during these challenging times.
32369666, The cumulative incidence of VTE was higher in the ICU (26% (95% CI, 17-37), 47% (95% CI, 34-58), and 59% (95% CI, 42-72) at 7, 14 and 21 days) than on the wards (any VTE and symptomatic VTE 5.8% (95% CI, 1.4-15), 9.2% (95% CI, 2.6-21), and 9.2% (2.6-21) at 7, 14, and 21 days).
32369666, The observed risk for VTE in COVID-19 is high, particularly in ICU patients, which should lead to a high level of clinical suspicion and low threshold for diagnostic imaging for DVT or PE.
32369666, Future research should focus on optimal diagnostic and prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE and potentially improve survival.This article is protected by copyright.

32368994, The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions.
32368994, The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of 'Other' diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc.Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset.
32368994, We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioural problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians.
32368994, It is unclear from the study whether the reduction in admissions was contributed to most by the current pandemic or the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic.'
32368875, A questionnaire should be made for COVID-19.
32368875, In cancer cases requiring urgent treatment, radionuclide treatment (RNT) should be planned according to the COVID-19 test result.
32368875, If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.
32368875, Following imaging procedures, scanners and room surfaces should be cleaned by personnel with proper disinfection training.
32368728, The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74•7% and specificity of 68•7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0•717.
32368728, The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67•9% and specificity of 78•2% (AUC=0•730).
32368728, The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.
32368728, This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Hubei Province (MSTIP).© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

32367319, Thoracic VCAR can generate a clear, fast and concise report that communicates vital medical information to referring physicians.
32367319, In the post-processing phase, software, thanks to the help of a colorimetric map, recognizes the ground glass and differentiates it from consolidation and quantifies them as a percentage with respect to the healthy parenchyma.
32367319, AI software therefore allows to accurately calculate the volume of each of these areas.
32367319, Therefore, keeping in mind that CT has high diagnostic sensitivity in identifying lesions, but not specific for Covid-19 and similar to other infectious viral diseases, it is mandatory to have an AI software that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one.

32363205, The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed.Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission.
32363205, It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later.
32363205, After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus.

32358691, The CXR score was significantly higher in males than in females only in groups aged 50 to 79 years.
32358691, A significant correlation was observed between the CXR score and age in both males and females.
32358691, Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older with coronavirus disease 2019 showed the highest CXR score (median ≥ 8).Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older showed the highest risk of developing severe lung disease.
32358691, Our results may help to identify the highest-risk patients and those who require specific treatment strategies.
32358689, At present, chest-computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32358689, Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units.
32358689, In this short communication, we present our experimental CXR scoring system that we are applying to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to quantify and monitor the severity and progression of this new infectious disease.
32358689, We also present the results of our preliminary validation study on a sample of 100 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection for whom the final outcome (recovery or death) was available.
32357288, These groups include infertility patients (eg, azoospermic and cryptozoospermic) undergoing medical or surgical treatment to improve sperm quantity and quality, as well as males of reproductive age affected by inflammatory and systemic auto-immune diseases who are about to start treatment with gonadotoxic drugs or who are under remission.
32357288, In both scenarios, the "fertility window" may be transitory; postponing diagnostic semen analysis and sperm banking in these men could compromise the prospects of biological parenthood.
32357288, Moreover, we provide recommendations on how to continue the provision of andrological services in a considered manner and a safe environment.

32356761, We shared the lessons learned and the obstacles encountered during real world high-volume screening programs.
32356761, Clinical needs are discussed to identify existing technology gaps in these tests.
32356761, Leverage technologies, such as engineered polymerases, isothermal amplification, and direct amplification from complex matrices may improve the productivity of current infrastructure, while emerging technologies like CRISPR diagnostics, visual end point detection, and PCR free methods for nucleic acid sensing may lead to at-home tests.
32356761, The lessons learned, and innovations spurred from the COVID-19 pandemic could upgrade our global public health infrastructure to better combat potential outbreaks in the future.
32356672, However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable.
32356672, Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure.
32356672, In view of the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), lung point-of-care ultrasound (Lu-PoCUS) is a still underutilized valuable alternative, especially when using pocket devices.
32356672, In this review the current value and role of stethoscope, pulsoxymetry, chest x ray, lung computer tomography and lung point-of-care ultrasound will be determined based on the available literature.
32356641, These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
32356641, Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
32356641, Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
32356641, This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.
32355546, The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated.
32355546, Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity.The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993]. In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result.
32355546, In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970].The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19.

32354113, Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile.
32354113, This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32354113, In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs.
32354113, The applications of nanochemistry and general nanotechnology was also discussed to give the status of nanodiagnostic systems for COVID-19.
32353857, I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis.
32353857, After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations.
32353857, I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in.
32353857, This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases.
32353760, One sample was detected on the SHC laboratory developed test (LDT) and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9.
32353760, Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6.The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

32352917, Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients.
32352917, Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates.
32352917, Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm.
32352917, This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.
32352915,The world is facing an unprecedented global pandemic in the form of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has ravaged all aspects of life, especially health systems.
32352915, Radiology services, in particular, are under threat of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients affected, unless drastic efforts are taken to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus.
32352915, Proactive measures, therefore, must be taken to ensure the continuation of diagnostic and interventional support to clinicians, while minimizing the risk of nosocomial transmission among staff and other patients.
32352915, This article aims to highlight several strategies to improve preparedness, readiness and response towards this pandemic, specific to the radiology department.
32352574, Additional studies are needed to establish whether simultaneous viral infection in SARS-CoV-2 patients could potential drive viral interference or influence disease outcomes.

32350796, According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays.
32350796, In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation.
32350796, Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement.
32350796, Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.
32350226, The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens.
32350226, While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.
32350226, Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
32350226, These indicate that the protocol using the N and N2 sets is comparable to commercially available kits and is reliable for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.
32350048, The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens.
32350048, The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay.
32350048, All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.

32349121, Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
32349121, CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations.
32349121, The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold.
32349121, Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9-11.
32349033, They can also be integrated into point-of-care products.
32349033, Furthermore, environmental biosensors can be designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the ambient air or in the intensive care ventilators.
32349033, Here, we evaluate technical components of biosensors, including the biological targets of recognition, the recognition methods and the signal amplification and transduction systems.
32349033, Effective SARS-CoV-2 detectors can be designed by adequate combination of these technologies.
32349032, Radiographic technologies and tools, including Computed tomography (CT) and Chest X-ray (CXR), were applied for initial screening and follow-up, from which provides detail diagnosis with specific pathologic features for staging and treatment arrangement.
32349032, Although the radiographic imaging is found less sensitive, numerous CT-positive patients were not screened out by RT-PCR initially and later confirmed as COVID-19 positive.
32349032, Besides, the shortage of sampling kits and the longer turn-over time of PCR examinations in some areas were noticed due to logistic issues and healthcare burden.
32349032, In this review, we will discuss the challenges and the future perspectives of using radiographic modalities for COVID-19 diagnosis in view of securing human lives amid the crisis.
32348588, In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate.

32347772, Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772, South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
32347112, The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
32347112, The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
32347112, In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
32347112, Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
32347053, Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design.
32347053, Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.
32347053, In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.
32347053, Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.
32346790, Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT.
32346790, Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature.We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients.
32346790, Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories.
32346790, Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19.The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.• Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. • The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
32346593, The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low.
32346593, There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination.

32346223, Its use is hampered by a lack of data, and by too much data.
32346223, Overcoming these constraints will require a careful balance between data privacy and public health, and rigorous human-AI interaction.
32346223, It is unlikely that these will be addressed in time to be of much help during the present pandemic.
32346223, In the meantime, extensive gathering of diagnostic data on who is infectious will be essential to save lives, train AI, and limit economic damages.© The Author(s) 2020.
32344568, The only reliable test in current use for testing acute infection targets the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and the most widely used method is quantitative fluorescence-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
32344568, Despite its ubiquity, there is a significant amount of uncertainty about how this test works, potential throughput and reliability.
32344568, This has resulted in widespread misrepresentation of the problems faced using this test during the current COVID-19 epidemic.
32344568, This primer provides simple, straightforward and impartial information about RT-qPCR.
32344438, The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively.
32344438, Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale.
32344438, We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system.

32343300, Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days.Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions.The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures).The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female.
32343300, Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties.
32343300, No adverse events occurred.In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated.
32343300, By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.
32342928, Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness.
32342928, Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients.
32342928, Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab.Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield.
32342928, Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others.
32342927, All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples.
32342927, The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed.There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring.
32342927, More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway.
32342927, The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests.
32342570, An understanding of current and developing testing methods is important for interpreting test results.We performed a literature review of current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing highlighting its utility, limitations, and implications for otolaryngologists.The currently accepted RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 has varying sensitivity according to which subsite of the aerodigestive tract is sampled.
32342570, Nasal swab sensitivities appear to be about 70%. Chest CT imaging for screening purposes is not currently recommended.Due to the current sensitivity of RT-PCR based testing for SARS-CoV-2, a negative test cannot rule out COVID-19.
32342570, Full PPE should be worn during high-risk procedures such as aerosol generating procedures even if testing is negative.
32342570, Patients who test positive during screening should have their surgeries postponed if possible until asymptomatic and have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32342566, Olfactory assessment showed variable degree hyposmia in 60 cases and anosmia in two patients.
32342566, Gustatory assessment revealed hypogeusia in 33 cases and complete ageusia in one patient.
32342566, Statistically significant differences in chemosensitive recovery were detected based on age and distance from the onset of clinical manifestations.Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions represent common clinical findings in COVID-19 patients.
32342566, Otolaryngologists and head-neck surgeons must by now keep this diagnostic option in mind when evaluating cases of ageusia and nonspecific anosmia that arose suddenly and are not associated with rhinitis symptoms.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32341143, Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically.
32341143, To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19 positive patients.
32341143, In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Modified CDC), the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular), GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 assay (GenMark) and the Hologic Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic).

32340541, Institutions are faced with the challenge of upholding the standard of care while maintaining safety for health care personnel and patients.
32340541, Due to the common performance of aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures in the upper respiratory tract, otolaryngologists are at uniquely high risk for potential infection.
32340541, When possible, alternative diagnostic and treatment strategies should be pursued.
32340541, For patients suspected of having functional laryngeal abnormalities, transcervical laryngeal ultrasound provides a rapid and noninvasive evaluation of vocal fold motion to inform decisions about safety of feeding, airway, and progression of care.
32339615,National efforts are underway to prepare our health service for the pandemic of COVID-19; however, the efficacy of these interventions is unknown.
32339615, In view of this, we carried out a cross-sectional survey of front line healthcare workers (HCW) at two large acute NHS hospital Trusts in England, to assess their confidence and perceived level of preparedness for the virus.
32339615, We demonstrate that there has been moderate success in readying HCW to manage COVID-19, but that more still needs to be done, particularly in relation to educating HCW about the laboratory diagnostics.Copyright © 2020.

32338347, Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present.
32338347, An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel.
32338347, To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised.
32338347, As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.
32336959, A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
32336959, Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs.
32336959, The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury.

32336317, Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective.
32336317, As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus.
32336317, This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP).

32335089,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 by molecular diagnostic laboratories.
32335089, We developed a multiplex rRT-PCR methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR: the Sarbecovirus specific E gene, the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene, and the human ABL1 gene as an internal control.Good correlation of Cq values was observed between the simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR methodologies.
32335089, Low copies (<25 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method.The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32333222, Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome sequences obtained from infected patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV.
32333222, The possible person-to-person disease rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries.
32333222, Without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs, early detection and isolation become essential against novel Coronavirus.
32333222, In this review, we introduced current diagnostic methods and criteria for the SARS-CoV-2 in China and discuss the advantages and limitations of the current diagnostic methods, including chest imaging and laboratory detection.
32332061, All three assays showed 100% negative percent agreement (NPA).
32332061, In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen (∼17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress (∼46 minutes) and the ePlex (∼1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance.
32332061, The ePlex had the longest time to results and showed a slight improvement in PPA over the ID NOW.

32330291, Sixty-one COVID-19 patients and 64 patients from a control group were tested by iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG.
32330291, All COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction result.
32330291, The highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer's cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes.
32330291, The receiver operating characteristic curves showed area under the curve values of 0.918 and 0.980 for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG, respectively. iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer has shown highly accurate results for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies profile and can be considered an excellent tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32330124,With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment.
32330124, Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment.
32330124, The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response.
32330124, Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.
32329877, However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2.
32329877, Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
32329877, Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.

32329432, Early safe reintroduction of immune individuals into the workforce may be essential to protecting the economic welfare of communities.
32329432, Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing, our primary diagnostic tool to date, has sensitivity and timing concerns, owing to sampling/handling errors, as well as a complex virus-host interaction.
32329432, Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays do not establish immune status once the virus has been cleared.
32329432, Targeted serosurveillance for the determination of individuals' potential for transmissibility, particularly if paired with direct pathogen testing, may aid in "cleared for business" decision-making.

32329026, A matter of debate is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets.
32329026, Thus, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with confirmed COVID-19.A 31-year-old man with fever, myalgia, anosmia, and ageusia was tested and found positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a pharyngeal swab.
32329026, Eight days after he provided semen and urine samples in which viral RNA presence was measured using a Real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting E and S viral genes.Semen and urine samples search for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative.
32329026, Although this should be interpreted cautiously, it may be possible that either the viral clearance kinetics in these matrices matches the progressive clinical recovery of the patient or that the virus was never present in these fluids at the time of the laboratory diagnosis.
32328954, Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality.
32328954, Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged.
32328954, However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city.
32328954, The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.
32327904, Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test.
32327904, It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.©The Author(s) 2020.

32327383, The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies.Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard.
32327383, Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound.Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting.
32327383, However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus.The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.Copyright © 2020.

32327245, The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P < .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation.
32327245, Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity.
32327245, The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%.The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.Copyright © 2018.

32325718, Access to protective equipment was as follows: gel hand sanitizer (n = 889; 95%), disposable gloves (n = 853; 91.1%), disposable gowns (n = 630; 67.3%), disposable surgical masks (785; 83.9%), N95 masks (n = 516; 56.1%), and facial protective shields (n = 305; 32.6%).
32325718, The vast majority (n = 707; 75.5%) had access to personal safety policies and procedures, and 699 (74.7%) participants had access to diagnostic algorithms.
32325718, On a 1-to-10 Likert scale, the participants expressed limited human resources support (4.92 ± 0.2; mean ± SD), physical integrity protection in the workplace (5.5 ± 0.1; mean ± SD), and support from public health authorities (5.01 ± 0.12; mean ± SD).
32325718, Healthcare workers in Latin America had limited access to essential PPE and support from healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32324653, However, if one opts to use the term "COVID-19" in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language.
32324653, In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide.
32324653, Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach.
32324653, The goal of this expert consensus is to help radiologists recognize findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and aid their communication with other healthcare providers, assisting management of patients during this pandemic.
32324451, There is a need for medical and scientific expertise to clinically and sociologically contextualize and interpret diagnostic tests as well as drugs and vaccines that will be deployed in the coming months as part of the planetary collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32324451, In a time of pandemic and facing a novel infectious pathogen, health care workers are in need of planetary scale consultation and support.
32324451, Even creating a small consultation network using mobile applications might offer improved health outcomes.
32324451, The Internet of Things and digital health ought to be considered in concert with telemedicine as part of an effective pandemic response.
32324360, At the initial phase, the atypical presentations of the virus infection are multiplex, peripheral ground glass opacities situated in the right lower lobe of the lung evolving rapidly into a bilateral involvement of the middle and basal zones.
32324360, Along with the progression, the ratio of the consolidation is increasing subsequently deteriorating into fibrosis with reticular pattern.
32324360, Chest ultrasound performed at the bedside has a paramount importance to reduce the possible number of health-care worker contacts in consequence of the strict and special infection control orders established on account of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.

32323974, A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples.
32323974, We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
32323974, One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR.
32323974, Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.
32320809, Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies.
32320809, Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0.
32320809, Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32320375, Emerging infectious diseases by their nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic-treatment-control nexus, and push our concepts of causality beyond the limits of the conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology.
32320375, We need to use contemporary methods of assessing causality to ensure that clinical, laboratory and public health measures draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation.
32320375, The purpose of any aetiological hypothesis is to derive actionable insights into this latest emerging infectious disease.
32320375, This review is an introduction to a conversation with medical microbiologists, which will be supported by a moderated blog.
32320064, Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection.

32318891, However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients.
32318891, Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients.
32318891, The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination.
32318891, Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.
32317810, It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
32317810, The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region.
32317810, Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.
32317810, Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.© Association of Microbiologists of India 2020.
32317409, Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them.
32317409, One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health.
32317409, This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions.
32317409, Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.
32316618, Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
32316618, COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
32316618, Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
32316618, The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32316233, The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min).
32316233, The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min).Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor.
32316233, Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
32316233, To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.
32313822, A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing respiratory syndrome mostly in Hubei Province, China.

32312574, The overlap in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment.
32312574, However, identifying features atypical for COVID-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of Computed Tomography Angiography among these patients.
32312574, Hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13% of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among COVID-19 infections.
32312574, Additionally, the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography (EKG) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with COVID-19 infections.Published by Elsevier Inc.
32312025, Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32312025, In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands.
32312025, While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications.
32312025, Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.
32311437, The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times).
32311437, DISCUSSION|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs).
32311437, Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32310621, Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.
32310621, The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
32310621, In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.
32310621, In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
32306853, This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV).
32306853, Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR.
32306853, Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.
32306853, In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.
32306500, Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate.
32306500, This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models.

32304371, Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence.
32304371, This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents.
32304371, All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.
32304371, Therefore, public health literacy is needed.
32304192, Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk.
32304192, Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended.
32304192, The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented.
32304192, In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole.
32302956, In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied.The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was -1.52.
32302956, With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6-24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2-43.0.The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32302813, Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo.Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection.
32302813, Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection.

32302277, The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019.
32302277, A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with α< 0.05 (95% confidence interval).All six of the questions - 1) "I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;" 2) "I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;" 3) "I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;" 4)"I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;" 5) "I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;" and 6) "I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles" - showed statistical significant change pre and post training.
32302277, Additionally, the final two questions - "I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;" and "This training was valuable" - received high scores on the Likert scale.This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics.
32302277, This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.
32302058, During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
32302058, In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
32302058, In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.

32301749, Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate the validity of the MAGLUMI 2000 Plus CLIA assay for the measurement of specific IgM and IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients, and for obtaining valuable data on the kinetics of both (IgM and IgG) COVID-19 antibodies.
32301749, These data represent a pre-requisite for the appropriate utilization of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
32301745, Conclusions The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs.
32301745, We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.
32301745, The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.
32301647, Conclusion In patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, visual or software quantification the extent of CT lung abnormality were predictors of ICU admission or death.
32301646, Conclusion Outside of China where there is a low-prevalence of COVID-19 (1-22.9%), chest CT screening of patients with suspected disease had low positive predictive value (1.5-30.7%).
32300971, Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417).
32300971, Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000).
32300971, The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits.Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.
32300971, A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19.• Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. • A diagnostic model for COVID-19 was developed and validated using radiological semantic and clinical features, which had an area under the curve value of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) and 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.
32300101, Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice.
32300101, So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time.
32300101, Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination.
32300101, This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.
32298250, On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases.
32298250, Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC.
32298250, Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.
32298250, Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.
32298149, CONCLUSION.
32298149, To date, the radiology literature on COVID-19 has consisted of limited retrospective studies that do not substantiate the use of CT as a diagnostic test for COVID-19.
32298139, Conclusions POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount.
32298139, Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources.
32298139, Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience.
32298139, The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.
32298029, Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer.
32298029, Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.

32297796, Management of ACovCS should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists and cardiologists.
32297796, Priorities for managing ACovCS include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point where intervention may be most effective.
32297796, The aim of this paper is to review the best available data on ACovCS epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.
32297796, From these data, we propose a surveillance, diagnostic and management strategy that balances potential patient risks and healthcare staff exposure with improvement in meaningful clinical outcomes.
32296940, Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial.
32296940, Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
32296940, Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency.
32296940, Key Points • In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. • Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. • Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.
32296837, With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs.

32466738, Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed >30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways.
32466738, Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges.
32466738, It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.
32466536, Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides.
32466536, Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders.
32466536, Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32466536, This review aimed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth summarization of the contribution of graphene-based nanomaterials in liquid biopsy, discussing the remaining challenges and the future trend; moreover, the paper gave the first look at the potentiality of graphene in COVID-19 diagnosis.
32464685, Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a drastic reduction of routine clinical activities and a consequent risk of looser connections between LVAD patients and their referring center.
32464685, Potential deleterious effects of such a situation can be delayed recognition of LVAD-related complications, misdiagnosis of COVID-19 and impaired social and psychological well-being for patents and families.

32462501, Four samples display a Ct < 22.0 for the E and RdRp genes while the N gene was not detected, suggesting a variability of the viral sequence.
32462501, There was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses.
32462501, The Allplex 2019-nCoV appears as a reliable method, but additional evaluations using more samples are needed.
32462501, RT-PCR assays should probably include at least 2 viral targets.
32462289, Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes.
32462289, Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis.
32462289, Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome.
32462289, A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.
32461326, The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU.
32461326, Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient.
32461326, As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home.In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was lower than in previously published studies.

32461285, NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).Conclusion: Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement.
32461285, However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load.
32461285, The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32461068, The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003.Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
32461068, Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak.
32461068, The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p<0.001).Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020.

32460829, At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19.
32460829, All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities.
32460829, In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (> 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.
32460829, Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.
32460457, Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened.A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5).
32460457, Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation.
32460457, During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization.The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis.
32460457, LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.
32460364, Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation.
32460364, Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs. 11%, p-value 0.06).The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common pediatric medical conditions.
32460364, We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.This article is protected by copyright.

32453196, Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia.
32453196, Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger.
32453196, Other viruses were associated with hypoxia more frequently than cases with HCoV; high fever was more common in influenza infections and bronchiolitis in respiratory syncytial virus group.
32453196, Although a slight peak of circulation appears mostly in winter, HCoV has been detected throughout the year as well.HCoV infections represent a small fraction of respiratory infections that require hospitalization in children and their characteristics do not differ greatly from other respiratory viral infections.
32452804, For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline.Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses.
32452804, Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19.

32452700, Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices.
32452700, The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment.
32452700, A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection.
32452700, The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.
32452539, The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
32452539, Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
32452539, This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.

32452195, Decision on delivery mode should be individualised.
32452195, Vertical transmission of coronavirus from the pregnant woman to the fetus has not been proven.
32452195, As the virus is absent in breast milk, the experts encourage breastfeeding for neonatal acquisition of protective antibodies.
32451655, The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients.
32451655, The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country.
32451655, The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively.
32451655, As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic.Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%. The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.

32450712, Although the highest number of new cases per 1 million people in China was 9.8 on February 28, 2020; it was 108.4 on March 21, 2020, in Italy; and this was 16.6 on March 5, 2020, in South Korea.
32450712, On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey.
32450712, The log-cubic model proposed in this study has been set forth to obtain successful results for aforementioned countries, as well as to estimate the course of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32450712, Other factors such as climacteric factors and genetic differences, which may have an impact on viral spreading and transmission, would also have strengthened the model prediction capacity.
32450107, After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223-1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368-1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218-1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273-1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.
32450107, Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935-2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106-5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760-4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344-4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.
32450107, Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32449791, The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms affected were apathy (4.15 (3.78) vs 5.75 (4.02); p=0.002) and anxiety (3.95 (3.73) vs 5.30 (4.01); p=0.006) in MCI patients and apathy (2.35 (2.70) vs 3.75 (3.78); p=0.036), agitation (0.45 (1.14) vs 1.50 (2.66); p=0.029) and aberrant motor behaviour (1.25 (2.86) vs 2.00 (2.93); p=0.044) in AD patients.
32449791, We did not observe differences in EuroQol-5D scores during the reevaluation.
32449791, Approximately 30% of patients and 40% of caregivers reported a worsening of their health status during confinement.We have demonstrated the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5 weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.This article is protected by copyright.

32449614, Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators.
32449614, The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.
32449614, Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes.
32449614, Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.
32449178, According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES=0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES=0.22 and 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES=0.19), negative affectivity (ES = 0.96) and less positive affectivity (ES=0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort.
32449178, Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms [OR=1.94, χ2(1)=10.05, p=.002]. Multiple regression analyses indicated that COVID-19 pregnant women having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms.
32449178, Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.This article is protected by copyright.

32447746, Such central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms linked to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is often life threatening.
32447746, Health care providers currently evaluating patients with neurologic symptoms need consider COVID-19 in any differential diagnosis.
32447746, These considerations will facilitate prompt testing, isolation and prevention of viral transmission speeding best clinical outcomes.
32447746, Graphical Abstract.
32447443, A higher number of daily consultations was performed during 2019 (7.33 vs 2.97, p < 0.001).
32447443, Similarly, the number of daily-invasive procedures was higher in 2019 (p = 0.006), while there was no difference in the number of daily admissions (15 vs 12, p = 0.80).
32447443, On multivariate analysis, the year (2020 vs 2019, OR 2.714, 95% CI 1.096-6.757, p = 0.0297) was a significant predictor of admission.Urgent urology practice was affected during COVID-19 pandemic with a remarkable reduction in urgent urological consultations; furthermore, a higher risk of admissions was observed in 2020.
32447443, The consequences of a potentially delayed diagnosis remain to be determined.
32446037, To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs.
32446037, The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others.The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario.As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes.
32446037, We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32445083, In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging.
32445083, We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer.
32445083, As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed.
32445083, As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries.
32444866, Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery.
32444866, For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.
32444866, The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.

32443834, Visual inspection of EEGs of COVID patients showed a near-physiological pattern with scarce anomalies.
32443834, The distribution of EEG bands was different for the three groups, with COVID midway between distributions of ENC and CRA; specifically, temporal lobes showed different distribution for EEG bands in COVID patients.
32443834, Besides, SSE was higher and hemispheric connectivity lower for COVID.
32443834, We objectively identified some numerical EEG features in severely ill COVID patients that can allow positive diagnosis of this encephalopathy.
32443828,During the COVID-19 emergency, the medical operating protocols have been largely modified for reducing any type of contamination risk, for working in a safe way and for making the patient feel in a safe environment.
32443828, Telemedicine, smart phones and apps could represent important devices for the community, in order to prevent virus trasmission and to perform quick diagnosis and management at medical offices.
32443828, This manuscript could be useful for clinicians with regard to the current state of the effectiveness of the telephone triage in this COVID-19 epidemic period.
32443828, Therefore, it could be an important starting point for future perspectives about telemedicine and virtual patient management.
32442720, In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2.
32442720, This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19.
32442720, Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32440666, GGO score was found to be equally distributed among different sex and age categories; however, the presence of dyspnea on admission was significantly associated with a higher GGO score (p= 0.022).
32440666, Cavitation, reticulation, calcification, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance and nodules were not identified in any of the cases.COVID-19 mainly affects the lower lobes of the lungs.
32440666, GGO and consolidation in the lung periphery is the imaging hallmark in patients with COVID-19 infection.
32440666, Absence of bronchiectasis, solitary nodules, cavitation, calcifications, tree-in-bud appearance, and reversed halo-sign indicates that these features are not common findings, at least in the earlier stages.
32440661, According to the included articles, two children had died, one of which was a 14-year-old boy and his exposure history and underlying disease were unclear, and the other was a male newborn with gestational age of 35 weeks and 5 days, birth weight of 2200, Apgar score of 8, 8 (1 min and 5 min) and his first symptom was increased heart rate.
32440661, No differences were found between male and female children regarding infection with COVID-19.Most pediatrics were infected with COVID-19 due to family cluster or history of close contact.
32440661, Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared to infected adults.
32440661, We should pay special attention to early diagnosis and early treatment in children infected with COVID-19.
32440387, We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1.
32440387, The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2.
32440387, The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can "break" laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature.
32440387, We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.Copyright © 2020, Sibert et al.
32438876, With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT.
32438876, Consolidation performance accounts for 0% in 1- 2 days, 40% in 3- 6 days, and 71% in 7- 10 days.
32438876, The lesions are mostly near the pleura.
32438876, The number of lesions and the extent of the lesions increased as the disease progressed.Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia have characteristic CT features in the initial stage of infection, which can be used as an essential supplement for nucleic acid examination.
32438579, Compared to the former two, the starters (cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed longer symptom-onset to diagnosis (p = 0.02); longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation (p = 0.01); higher first-generation reproduction number (p = 0.03); and more critical presentation (endotracheal tube insertion and intensive care unit (ICU) care) (p < 0.01).
32438579, In addition, compared to the former two, the starters of the latter were older, had no history of travel, and had more underlying diseases and more mortality.
32438579, There are more contacts of domestic family cluster infections, making epidemiological investigations more difficult and expensive.
32438579, However, the second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero.Domestic family cluster infections of COVID-19 have different characteristics and outcomes from couple infection and imported family cluster infections in this study.
32437936, The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described.
32437936, Our patient, a medical person, had viral exanthem distributed in the extremities along with a "Spins and needles sensation," which differs from a previously published paper on cutaneous manifestations.

32437576, Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever.
32437576, Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath.
32437576, Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms.Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread.
32437576, The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.
32437004, Liver injury may be a risk factor for progresses and worsens in patients with COVID-19, and it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of liver injury in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

32435925, The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%).
32435925, Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved.
32435925, The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with "white lungs." The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance.The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved.
32435925, Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption).• The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected. • CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression. • CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.
32434635, Both cases were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32434635, They had obesity and a family history of hypertension.
32434635, Continuous blood pressure monitoring in the resting state during hospitalization showed that blood pressure was above the 95% reference interval of normal value for children of the same age, and the two boys were given calcium channel blockers or β-receptor blockers and were then recovered.
32434635, It is concluded that comprehensive management of children with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, should be taken seriously during the epidemic.
32434634, Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
32434634, All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered.COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results.
32434634, Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.
32434634, Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged <18 years.
32434633, One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×109/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (>400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (>1.6 mmol/L).
32434633, Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children.Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation.
32434633, Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests.
32434633, Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.
32434310, The chest CT findings exhibited no significant differences between the groups.Fever was found to be the most common symptom in COVID-19, and respiratory infection signs were also commonly present.
32434310, Fever and dyspnea were less frequently observed in the patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan, which should be considered in COVID-19 screening programs.
32434310, These results may be attributable to the earlier diagnosis of the disease and the younger age of patients outside of Wuhan although further analysis is needed.
32434310, The role of chest CT in COVID-19 diagnosis is inconclusive based on this study.
32434058, The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management.
32434058, We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.
32434058, We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

32433168, A retrospective review of her clinical and laboratory data was strongly suggestive for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
32433168, PET/CT images demonstrated hypermetabolic diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs with bilateral nodules.
32433168, There was no evidence of pleural effusion or prominent mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
32433168, Radiologists must be aware of COVID-19 presentations on PET/CT scan images during COVID-19 outbreak.
32432996, When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
32432996, Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32432996, Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased.
32432996, Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.
32432804, These are continuing problems as coronavirus epidemics may recur with future impact on blood collection and blood donation screening.

32427924, Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32427924, In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist.
32427924, The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative.
32427924, When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.
32427468, All these findings lead to an implication of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
32427468, Here we provide additional elements that could explain other described signs like appetite loss, vomiting, and nausea.
32427468, For this, we investigated the role of brainstem structures located in the medulla oblongata involved in food intake and vomiting control.
32427468, We also discussed the possible pathways the virus uses to reach the brainstem, i.e., neurotropic and hematogenous (with its two variants) routes.

32425651, The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
32425651, According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22nd March (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).
32425651, However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available.
32425651, Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.© 2020 The Author(s).
32425646, The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test).
32425646, In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p<0.05).
32425646, Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status.The diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients.

32425010, From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute.
32425010, Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses.
32425010, In accordance with the national standard "Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016)," we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.
32425010, Based on the experience we attained from the 12 severe COVID-19 cases in our hospital who underwent endoscopy 23 times in total, the article provides an improved version of endoscopic reprocessing guidelines for bedside endoscopic diagnosis and treatment on COVID-19 patients for reference.
32425000, Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic.
32425000, Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development.
32425000, This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.
32425000, We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic.
32424616, Clinical characteristics and treatment were retrospective analyzed.
32424616, Olfactory disorders are uncommon symptoms of COVID-19 in China.
32424616, Early diagnosis and intervention are keys to the recovery of olfactory disorders.
32424616, Particular attention should be devoted to olfactory dysfunction.
32423842, However, false negative cases are possible.
32423842, We report 4 cases of false negative chest X-Rays, in patients who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 by real-time transverse-transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and executed chest unenhanced CTs just after the X-Rays, demonstrating signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers.

32423435, Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type.
32423435, Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes.
32423435, One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins.The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various.
32423435, Accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT imaging data.
32423324, Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.
32423324, In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding.
32423324, We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.
32423324, It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.
32423291,With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many novel presentations of known conditions are occurring.
32423291, In the pediatric population, new instances of Kawasaki disease have recently been singled out as presenting in conjunction with or soon after diagnosis of COVID-19.
32423291, This poses a novel situation, particularly for otolaryngologists, who may be the first to encounter these patients.
32423291, Otolaryngologists should be cognizant of the coexistence of conditions to allow for timely recognition and optimal management.
32423250, Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment.
32423250, Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death.
32423250, In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
32423250, There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions.This review highlighted the ways in which coronaviruses affect cardiovascular function and interacts with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.
32422983, The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection.
32422983, Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients.
32422983, As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary.
32422983, Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32422376, We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.
32422376, This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe COVID-19 associated with remdesivir therapy.
32422376, Further studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this combination strategy in the treatment of this emerging infection.Copyright © 2020.

32420927,The global context we are experiencing, characterized by the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, imposes strict containment, isolation and physical distance measures, necessary to control and contain the risk of contagion.
32420927, Despite social distances and isolation in this context of threat to Global Health, the sharing of experiences, professionalism, scientific research and Public Health strategies is fundamental.
32420927, Never before has telemedicine played a decisive role in supporting the healthcare organization, The University Hospital Consortium Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental partnership project with West China Hospital of Sichuan University through periodic and scheduled video conferences.The Company Strategic Management, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bari, Medical Executives of the Health Department, of the U.O of Infectious Diseases, Anesthesia and Resuscitation, Pulmonology, Emergency, Hygiene, Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Doctors Resident operating in the COVID Area. are involved in the Experimental Project., all adequately trained and instructed on the operating protocol.From the preliminary data of this study, it appears that the Bari Polyclinic has adopted the same therapeutic strategies started in China in the previous months, believing early diagnosis and treatment to be a strength in the battle against COVID-19.
32420927, The project makes it possible to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, using the experience acquired in the field by Chinese doctors who, first caught by this health emergency, have obtained positive results.
32420788, Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
32420788, These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention.
32420788, In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern.
32420788, Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.
32420073, For confirmed or suspected patients, three-level protection should be performed during the operation.
32420073, Disinfection and isolation measures should be strictly carried out during the operation.

32419694, Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.
32419694, The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission.
32419694, Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.
32419694, This fact necessitates vigilant awareness in clinical investigation, management, and infection control, especially in tropical resource-limited settings.
32418804, Characteristics of the common testing options are discussed including the circumstances where additional testing may be of benefit and considerations for the associated risks.

32418559, These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures.
32418559, It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections.
32418559, Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed.
32418559, Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.
32418377, Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon.
32418377, However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32416785, No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37).
32416785, Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80).
32416785, The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.Instituto de Salud Carlos III.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32414384, Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics.
32414384, Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak.
32414384, China provides solutions by adopting nationwide "pairing assistance" measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area.
32414384, By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing "pairing assistance" is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.
32412551, Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task.
32412551, A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks.Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19.
32412551, A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved.
32412551, Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.© Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering 2020.

32406829, Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers.
32406829, Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.
32406522, Here, we aim to provide an update on the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 presenting the symptoms that can be encountered in infected patients.

32405232, While there are widespread reports of intentional reductions in elective hospitalizations, trends in urgent or emergent hospitalizations including heart failure (HF) hospitalizations have not been adequately characterized.We evaluated trends of HF hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center using electronic health records and discharge database.
32405232, We also compared HF hospitalization trends during the same time frame in 2019 to account for seasonal variation in HF presentations.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our medical center, a mean of 30 patients per week were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF.
32405232, After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Mississippi, there was a sharp 50% decline in the number of HF hospitalizations that declined even further after a "state of emergency" was declared in Mississippi.Based on observations from a large academic medical center, there has been a significant reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for HF during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405232, Further investigation of these trends is warranted to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term HF outcomes.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

32405079, On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased.
32405079, Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis.
32405079, In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease.Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32404799, Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality.
32404799, The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement.
32404799, The extensive pulmonary involvement in some of these pathologies may obscure the typical manifestation of COVID-19, whereas other preexisting pathologies may resemble the atypical or rare CT manifestations of this viral pneumonia.
32404799, Thus, understanding the specific CT manifestations in these special subgroups is essential for a prompt diagnosis.
32403190, Procedures can be carried out in the community and can be conducted safely during the coronavirus pandemic.
32403190, It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy.As colonoscopy services resume, they will likely experience high demand leading to further delays for patients.

32403007, Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa (κ) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load.Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC).
32403007, SC was highly concordant with HC (κ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (κ = 0.959 vs 0.933).
32403007, Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT.Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32402056, Overall, 7 patients (25%) died.
32402056, Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization.In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT.
32402056, Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients.
32402056, Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.
32401931, Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
32401931, Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
32401931, All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
32401931, The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
32401630, Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
32401630, Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19.
32401630, In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.
32399995, The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), p=0.034.
32399995, There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.These results suggest overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.

32397399, Conclusions: TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients.
32397399, Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32397262, Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32397262, Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed.
32397262, In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed.
32397262, If we want to identify "immune" people in order to let them to come back to work, serology is the best (and probably the only) approach.

32396947, Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested.
32396947, Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 0/7 weeks of gestation.
32396947, With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 0/7 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features.

32396101, While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention.
32396101, The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis.
32396101, The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.
32396101, Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.
32396075, Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic collection of CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult.
32396075, To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis.
32396075, The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs.
32396075, Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.
32395966, The degree of frailty, resilience and number of co-morbidities caused COVID-19 to present as acute geriatric syndrome events such as falls, delirium and dehydration in these patients.
32395966, Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population.
32395966, As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32395966, Protocols for diagnosis, and contact isolation measures, should take these atypical presentations into account.
32395897, Here, we review the types, characteristics and shortcomings of various detection methods, as well as perspectives for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
32395897, Clinically, nucleic acid-based methods are sensitive but prone to false-positive.

32395897, Therefore, it is suggested to combine the two methods to improve the detection accuracy of COVID-19.© 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.
32395829, Statements yielding equivocal responses predominantly related to technical and procedure choices, including: decontamination (40-68%), laminar flow systems (13-61%), PPE reuse (58%), risk stratification of patients (21-48%), open vs. laparoscopic surgery (63%), preferential cholecystostomy in biliary disease (48%), and definition of aerosol generating procedures (19%).High levels of consensus existed for many statements within each domain, supporting much of the initial guidance issued by professional bodies, yet several contentious areas arose, which represent urgent targets for investigation to delineate safe COVID-19 related OR practice.

32394687, Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic.
32394687, Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provide close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease.
32394687, Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32394687, Herein we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion.
32393381, The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
32393381, After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
32393381, Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
32393381, Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
32393111, The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited to retort this virus.
32393111, Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies.
32393111, Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32393111, This review discusses in brief about the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the role of animals, the veterinary and associated zoonotic links along with prevention and control strategies based on One-health approaches.
32392948, Conclusions: The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and alveolar interstitial syndrome, and may coexist with small range of pulmonary consolidation.
32392948, The sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound is higher than that of chest X-ray and CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, and could be used in monitoring and evaluation of the disease.
32392282, The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]).
32392282, In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]).
32392282, In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings.Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
32392282, However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.
32391666, With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
32391666, Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged.
32391666, There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization.
32391666, There were no deaths and no medical staff infections.The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.
32391664, No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients.
32391664, The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions.
32391664, CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
32391664, Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.CT images of patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
32391658, We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
32391658, It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32391658, Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
32391658, However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32391657, The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections.
32391657, Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
32391657, The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.
32391657, For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.
32391518, For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.5,6Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission.
32391518, Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive.
32391518, In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32391369, Four studies with 542 Chinese participants were included.
32391369, Two studies reported negative findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, i.e., corticosteroids had a detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
32391369, One study reported no significant association between the use of corticosteroids and clinical outcomes.
32391369, However, one study, on 201 participants with different stages of pneumonia due to COVID-19, found that in more severe forms, the administration of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the risk of death by 62%. The literature to date does not fully support the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19, but some findings suggest that methylprednisolone could lower mortality rate in more severe forms of the condition.Copyright © 2020 Veronese, Demurtas, Yang, Tonelli, Barbagallo, Lopalco, Lagolio, Celotto, Pizzol, Zou, Tully, Ilie, Trott, López-Sánchez and Smith.
32390696, Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals.
32390696, Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario.
32390696, A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers.

32386435,We have read with great interest the articles regarding cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.
32386435, Studies showed 20.4% of COVID-19 patients developed cutaneous manifestations and might be the only presenting symptom.(1) To date, previous cases reported urticaria as one of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19.(2)(1)(3)(4) This atypical symptom might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and virus transmission, especially in countries where cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported widely such as in Indonesia.
32386435, We would like to report a case of urticaria in COVID-19-positive non-ICU hospitalized patient from Indonesia to bring awareness to its cutaneous manifestations.This article is protected by copyright.

32386147, To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability.
32386147, Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia.
32386147, In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes.
32386147, Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.
32386027, Chinese administrations have carried out immediate and prompt measures to stop the spread of the virus.
32386027, Wuhan city has been shut down since Jan. 23, and more than 30 thousand medical workers have been recruited to Hubei province.
32386027, Two temporary hospitals were constructed to treat severe pneumonia patients, and 15 mobile cabin hospitals were built to treat mild pneumonia cases.
32386027, Significant improvement regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and diagnosis and therapy for the COVID-19 has been achieved to stop the spread of the epidemics.
32386019, A total of 5 patients from one family, including 4 adults and 1 child, had a history of human contact in Wuhan, Hubei.
32386019, Four adult patients showed different symptoms, including cough, fever, pharyngeal pain, and dyspnea, while the child patient had no symptoms.
32386019, Laboratory examination showed no abnormality in all the patients except for slight increase in CRP in 2 patients and mild abnormal liver function index in 1 patient.
32386019, The chest CT showed that all patients had abnormal images, with different degrees of manifestations.All patients were finally diagnosed by the nucleic acid test.
32386017, Multiple lesions were found in 71.17% patients and multiple lobules in 86.50% patients.
32386017, Lesions in 53.37% patients were found with bronchial inflation signs and those in 36.20% patients presented with "crazy paving" pattern, while only 7.36% were found with hilar node enlargement and pleural effusion.
32386017, First CT findings of 18 patients were found to be inconsistent with the results of pathogen examination.COVID-19 patients showed specific features in the first chest CT examination.
32386017, The combination of the first chest CT imaging features and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results as well as reexamination if necessary can help to make the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection accurately.
32386015, The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P< 0.01).Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics.
32386015, The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT.
32386015, Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes.
32386015, Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.
32386014, Among the 26 cases of "wrinkling shape" lesions in the second CT examination, except for 11 cases without reexamination, the other 15 patients had different degrees of absorption in the third CT examination.The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule.
32386014, As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion.
32386014, When the lesions show a "wrinkling shape", it is often suggested that the lesions will evolve towards the direction of absorption.
32386014, These characteristics are of great value in assisting clinical diagnosis and dynamically observing changes undersuch condition.
32386011, Chest imaging examination is an important auxiliary examination method in diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386011, To further standardize the imaging examination and diagnosis of COVID-19, Hunan Society of Radiology together with Imaging Technology Professional Committee of Hunan Medical Association reach an expert consensus document on imaging examination, diagnosis, and control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19.
32386011, This document summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging examination procedure, imaging findings, CT staging, the value of imaging examination, and the methods for control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19 during imaging examination.
32386011, Furthermore, it extends the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in children.
32385990, The main subject words were divided into three main categories, namely, CoVs epidemiology, basic research and drug development, in which basic research and drug development were strongly correlated.
32385990, In the subject words breakthrough analysis, there were time-related breakthrough points in 1991, 1996 and 2002, and the "diagnosis" and "sequence" were continuous hot spots.Through the visualization analysis of knowledge graph, the development trend and hot spots of CoVs therapy research could be well observed.
32385990, In this study, the degree of attention in the field of CoVs treatment showed periodic changes, related to the outbreak of new CoVs, and the country, institutions and the author were closely related.
32385990, The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation in order to develop new targets of drug.
32383963, A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy has been carried out.
32383963, Scientific papers currently available via the PubMed NCBI search engine on COVID-19 postmortem diagnosis were also examined.
32383963, Discussion: Throughout the history of medicine, the role of autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated postmortem through autopsy.
32383963, The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.
32383778, Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32383778, However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019.
32383778, We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19.Brief report.A university hospital in Saudi Arabia.A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever.The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up.Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2.The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32383778, Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.© 2020 The American Geriatrics Society.

32381057, Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used.
32381057, The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19).Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05).
32381057, The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854.
32381057, These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score >  2.With a simple and practical scoring system based on CT imaging features, we can make a hierarchical diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 with different management suggestions.
32380051, The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research.
32380051, With regard to infected patients with different stages and syndrome, the preferable potentials and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs were addressed through the comprehensive collection of relevant literatures and on-going clinical trials.
32380051, This study could provide an insight into clinical application and underlying mechanism of recommended CPMs against COVID-19, with the aim to share the Chinese experience in clinical practice and facilitate scientific development of TCM, especially CPMs in the fierce battle of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32379456, Therefore, identification of populations at highest risk of COVID-19 mortality could significantly improve the capacity of healthcare providers to take early action and minimize the possibility of overwhelming care centers, which in turn would save many lives.
32379456, Although several approaches have been used/developed (or are being developed/suggested) to diagnose COVID-19 infection, no approach is available/proposed for fast diagnosis of COVID-19 infections likely to be fatal.
32379456, The central aim of this short perspective is to suggest a few possible nanobased technologies (i.e., protein corona sensor array and magnetic levitation) that could discriminate COVID-19-infected people while still in the early stages of infection who are at high risk of death.
32379456, Such discrimination technologies would not only be useful in protecting health care centers from becoming overwhelmed but would also provide a powerful tool to better control possible future pandemics with a less social and economic burden.
32379104, The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested.
32379104, Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died.
32379104, Results differed among centers.There is a higher mortality rate in patients with a hip fracture and an associated positive test for COVID-19.Prognostic Level IV.
32379104, See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32378854, His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms.
32378854, However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient.
32378854, Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues.
32378854, Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

32377469,Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic is currently one of the most influential topics as it not only impacts the field of medicine but most importantly, it affects the lives of many individuals throughout the world.
32377469, We report an interesting 2019-nCoV case in a tertiary community hospital with the initial concern of acute pyelonephritis without respiratory symptoms that ultimately led to the quarantine of a number of healthcare providers.
32377469, This case emphasizes the importance of radiological evidence in diagnosing 2019-nCoV in the setting of an initial atypical presentation.
32377469, It also serves as an example of how healthcare providers may need to increase their suspicion for COVID-19 to ensure self-protection and prompt diagnosis in the era of an ongoing pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Zhang et al.
32377468, She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
32377468, Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults.
32377468, The patient likely contracted the virus from her parents, who because of the fear of social stigma hide recent history of respiratory illness.
32377468, These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Mansour et al.
32376573, Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea.
32376573, Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments.
32376573, Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (P < 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (P < 0.05).
32376573, The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05).MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.
32376571, In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay.
32376571, We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples.With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively.
32376571, For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%. Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9998-1.000, P < 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation.Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 ℃ for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators.
32376571, Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.
32376546, A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death.
32376546, The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak.
32376546, In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system.
32376546, These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.
32376543, Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia.
32376543, We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia.Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms.
32376543, Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like "crazy-paving" patterns.
32376543, The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a "dandelion clek-like" sign and 37 with a "dandelion seed sign". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.
32376532, To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation.
32376532, For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients.
32376532, During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis.
32376532, In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.

32376306, We also find that the model does not provide reliable estimates in countries that are in the early stages of outbreak.
32376306, We further find that the R2 value be varied and misleading when compared among different curves of the same nonlinear model, as well as the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and nations.We believe that there is potential for our model to contribute to better public health policy combatting COVID-19 by providing a simple logistical framework for retrospectively analyzing the outbreak in regions that have already experienced maximal proliferation in cases.

32376004, If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction.
32376004, Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.Copyright © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris.

32374538, The clinical presentation of COVID-19 range from non-specific symptoms to adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32374538, Diagnosis is based on PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab and emergency treatment rely on oxygen therapy.
32374538, Patient's orientation (home, hospitalization, admission in intensive care unit) is a central aspect of emergency management.
32374538, The shift from a strategy of systematic recognition of potential cases to the one of epidemic mitigation required hospital emergency medicine services to implement crisis management measures, to guarantee admission and hospitalization capacity.
32373999, Many efforts have been applied to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and many scientific studies have been conducted in a short period of time.
32373999, Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32373999, Current researches on potentially effective treatment alternatives are discussed.
32373999, We hope this review can help medical workers and researchers around the world contain the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32373990, This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19.
32373990, The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes.
32373990, A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion.
32373990, Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.
32373061, Acute stroke care requires rapid bedside attendance, imaging, and intervention.

32370128, However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions.
32370128, DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males.
32370128, Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.
32370128, The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados.
32369429, Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
32369429, Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
32369429, Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
32369429, To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
32369240, We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
32369240, Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines.
32369240, During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris.
32369240, The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32369222, Performing a chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease.
32369222, The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc.
32369222, The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition.
32369222, The management of COVID-19 should focus on early diagnosis, immediate isolation, general and optimized supportive care, and infection prevention and control.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32368928, CONCLUSION.
32368928, The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results.
32368928, Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.
32368570, The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.
32368570, COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32368570, COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.

32367888, CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32367749, Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding.
32367749, Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal.
32367749, The phenomenon disappeared after 17 days when the patient was cured.
32367749, This case emphasized the importance of peripheral blood smear and clinical manifestation, especially in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.
32367683, From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19.There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64).
32367683, For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%).
32367683, The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs. 29.7%, p = .02).More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes.
32367683, Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32366759, With the strict prevention and control measures implemented by the Chinese government, the spread of the epidemic in China has come under preliminary control by the end of February, 2020, whereas the situation of some countries outside China is not optimistic and raises great public concern.
32366759, In fighting COVID-19, radiologic examinations played a critical role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and could also help assess disease course and severity.
32366759, There is an urgent need to share useful experience and effective measures internationally.
32366759, This article outlines the collaborative actions and efforts by the Chinese radiology field and the situation of front-line health care workers in radiology departments to present the world with experiences and examples of Chinese radiology during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32366162, Many patients do not own a smartphone or have broadband access.
32366162, This "digital divide" is not fair to our patients in need-especially those with a cancer diagnosis.
32366162, Patients deserve access to care.
32366162, We need to implore insurance companies to provide tablets with wireless capabilities to patients in need.
32365891, This certainly generates insecurity and fear in people, with an important psychological component that is not to be underestimated at this stage of the pandemic.
32365891, The purpose of this article is to highlight all the sources currently present in the literature concerning the persistence of the different coronaviruses in the environment as well as in medical and dental settings.
32365891, As this was a current study, there are still not many sources in the literature, and scientific strategies are moving towards therapy and diagnosis, rather than knowing the characteristics of the virus.
32365891, Such an article could be an aid to summarize virus features and formulate new guidelines and anti-spread strategies.
32365567, This review gives an overview of the field in general and the most notable developments of the last five years, in three parts: 1.
32365567, What can we detect? 2.
32365567, Which detection technologies are used in which setting? 3.

32364528, Evaluating chest CT, clinical symptoms, and laboratory results could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and judge disease progression.
32364358, Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 vírus infection in the general population.
32364358, These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.

32357808, In contrast, N-IgG was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients.
32357808, The increase of S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients.
32357808, N and S specific IgM and IgG increased gradually after symptom onset and can be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32357808, Analysis of the dynamics of S-IgG may help to predict prognosis.
32357575, According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19.
32357575, The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person's vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis.
32357575, The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.
32357575, There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
32357503, Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
32357503, In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
32357503, Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32357503, Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
32357381,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic in March 2020.
32357381, A plethora of respiratory sampling methods for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection has been used and in the current evolving situation, there is no international consensus on the recommended method of respiratory sampling for diagnosis.
32357381, Otolaryngologists deal intimately with the upper respiratory tract and a clear understanding of the respiratory sampling methods is of paramount importance.
32357381, This article aims to provide an overview of the various methods and their evidence till date.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32356760, CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up.
32356760, The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored.
32356760, Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19.
32356760, In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.
32356508, Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP.We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP.
32356508, After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months.
32356508, Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes.In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP.
32356508, These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.
32355837, With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
32355837, Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.

32352933, However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097).CONCLUSIONAll populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk.
32352933, Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia.
32352933, It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible.FUNDINGThis work was supported by National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (no. 2017ZX10103005-007) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2018YFE0204500).
32352309, CONCLUSION.
32352309, We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32352309, In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.
32352202, The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea.
32352202, Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients.The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients.
32352202, Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.This article is protected by copyright.

32351103,COVID-19 infection, a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV virus, and the World Health Organization declared this increasingly spreading disease as a global public health emergency (pandemic).
32351103, In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as the reference standard test.
32351103, In the early stages, thorax CT findings could be present even before the onset of symptoms, thorax CT has quite high sensitivity in COVID-19 patients with false negative RT-PCR results, and it has a great importance not only in diagnosis but also in follow up (6,7).
32351103, We think that it might be beneficial for our radiologist colleagues in the early diagnosis of the imaging features of this disease, by sharing the experiences we have gained by evaluating the typical and relatively atypical CT findings regarding the natural course of the tomographic findings of COVID-19 and when to control CT.
32351037, These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia.
32351037, Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia.
32351037, Time intervals from onset to visit, hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response.

32350794, Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up.
32350794, In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool.
32350794, SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients.
32350794, In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.
32350462, Within 19 days after symptom onset, 100% of patients tested positive for antiviral immunoglobulin-G (IgG).
32350462, Seroconversion for IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially.
32350462, Both IgG and IgM titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion.
32350462, Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections.
32348585,The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to 185 countries with over 2.1 million confirmed cases and 145,000 deaths, as per the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard provided at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.
32348585, Imaging modalities such as chest radiography, thoracic and cardiovascular ultrasound, and computed tomography have roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and therapy of COVID-19.

32348339, We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features.
32348339, We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19.Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization.
32348339, The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23-8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL.These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19.
32348339, But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.Our study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the registration number: ChiCTR2000029829.
32347964,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, important elective procedures, such as screening colonoscopy, have been delayed or cancelled, and there may be a very long waitlist for rescheduling once the moratorium is lifted.
32347964, However, DNA-based stool sample tests may be useful for colorectal cancer screening when colonoscopy is not available.
32347964, The aim of this review is to demonstrate the potential utility of enhanced DNA-based stool testing for colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis during crises that strain available healthcare resources, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32347964, This review shows that DNA-based stool sample tests have the potential to enable colorectal cancer screening to prioritize patients to elective colonoscopy procedures, the continued delay of which during the COVID-19 pandemic has already placed a burden on future elective procedures.
32347761, For the dermatology community, this interruption to the healthcare system can lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.
32347761, Neglecting melanoma during this crisis can result in increased mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs.
32347761, With the COVID-19 pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, it is time for the prospective evaluation of teledermatology.
32347761, However, dermatologists should be cautious and continue seeing patients with pigmented lesions in person due to the necessity of early surgical intervention.
32347618, Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission since being closed to the patient.
32347618, Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital.
32347618, Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of our patients were not screened for COVID-19.
32347618, Our findings support the concerns of elective physician examinations.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32347200,Healthcare workers (n = 803) with mild symptoms were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 90 positive) and asked to complete a symptom questionnaire.
32347200, Anosmia, muscle ache, ocular pain, general malaise, headache, extreme tiredness and fever were associated with positivity.
32347200, A predictive model based on these symptoms showed moderate discriminative value (sensitivity: 91.2%; specificity: 55.6%).
32347200, While our models would not justify presumptive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis without molecular confirmation, it can contribute to targeted screening strategies.
32347067, The sensitivity of this method was satisfactory.
32347067, The results were consistent with those of the COVID-19 detection kit on the market under the same conditions, but the number of cycles required was shortened by about 2.
32347067, Therefore, the optimized assay developed in this study can be used in screening and early clinical diagnosis.
32347067, Our work provides a tool to facilitate rapid clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32346873, As of 8 March 2020, all patients have been discharged.
32346873, The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR: 4.0-9.0 days).
32346873, Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.

32346843, Here, we raise the importance of stringent diagnosis and data collection regarding neurological complications of COVID-19; we urge caution in the over-diagnosis of neurological disease where it does not exist, but equally strongly encourage the concerted surveillance for such conditions.
32346843, Additional to the direct neurological complications of COVID-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32346843, We therefore also outline the specific management of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases in the context of the pandemic.
32346843, This article describes the implications of COVID-19 on neurological disease and advertises the Neurocritical Care Society's international data collection collaborative that seeks to align data elements.

32345728, Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined.Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness.
32345728, Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20%, and 36.4%, respectively).
32345728, Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes.Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness.

32345226, Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests.
32345226, Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients.Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan.
32345226, Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems.
32345226, Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.

32343968, Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking.
32343968, We report two cases of patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated by CRS and were treated with tocilizumab.
32343968, Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
32343968, These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.Published by Elsevier Inc.
32342849, This was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and since then has become widespread globally.
32342849, We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms).
32342849, This is to our knowledge the longest duration of viral shedding reported to date.
32342849, This case demonstrates that viral shedding after COVID-19 diagnosis can be prolonged.
32342543, Droplet contamination was 57.8%, 59.5%, 8.0%, and 0% for operating, first and second assistant surgeons, and scrub nurse respectively.
32342543, Droplet count was highest and most widespread during osteotomies.
32342543, No droplet splash was noted for transoral robotic surgery.Face shield is not a mandatory adjunctive PPE for all head and neck surgical procedures and health care providers.

32342191, In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated.
32342191, At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms.The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management.
32342191, Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.
32342191, Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.
32341722, In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
32341722, Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.

32341519, All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered.
32341519, Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered.
32341519, The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients.
32341519, In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.
32341078, COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were positive for the three patients.The patients were transferred to the COVID-19 centre for disease control at Montpellier University Hospital.
32341078, As of 29 March 2020, two of those patients are still intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the third was discharged home.COVID-19 infections may present as an acute abdominal pain.

32340555, This tool allows health care providers to confidentially submit cases of anosmia and dysgeusia related to COVID-19.
32340555, We analyzed the first 237 entries, which revealed that anosmia was noted in 73% of patients prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6%. Some improvement was noted in 27% of patients, with a mean time to improvement of 7.2 days in this group (85% of this group improved within 10 days).
32340555, Our findings suggest that anomia can be a presenting symptom of COVID-19, consistent with other emerging international reports.
32340555, Anosmia may be critical in timely identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 who may be unwittingly transmitting the virus.
32340096, Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension.

32337664, Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes.
32337664, IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm.
32337664, Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials.
32337664, In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and "Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)" in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.
32337201, Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19.

32337148, The mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular involvement. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical emergency which needs immediate coronary re-perfusion for better patient outcomes.
32337148, Here we present a patient who presented to the emergency room with acute STEMI and later tested positive for COVID-19.
32337148, She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.

32337143, The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
32337143, It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
32337143, Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
32337143, Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.Copyright © 2020, Pal et al.
32335585, Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment.
32335585, Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.
32335585, This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19.

32335173, Our data show that both children and adults with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population.Immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 seem to be few in relation to the overall figures, and to present a favorable outcome as compared to other comorbidities.
32335173, This might be explained by a hypothetical protective role of a weaker immune response, determining a milder disease presentation and thus underdiagnosis.
32335173, Nevertheless, surveillance on this special population should be encouraged.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32333860,A severe form of pneumonia, is the leading complication of the respiratory Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), recently renamed SARS-CoV-2.
32333860, Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction.In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n = 21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n = 54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020).PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR = 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p < 0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r = 0.59, p < 0.001), LDH (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) and PCT (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay.
32333860, In fact patients showing PSP values higher than 250 ng/L (cut-off for risk stratification) did stay in ICU for a significantly longer time (median 17 days, IQR 12-31; p < 0.001) than those exhibiting lower values (median 10 days, IQR 7-18).The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.Copyright © 2020.

32333544, Point-of-care lung ultrasound has multiple advantages, including lack of radiation exposure and repeatability.
32333544, Also, lung ultrasound has been shown to be more sensitive than a chest radiograph in detecting alveolar-interstitial syndrome.
32333544, The utilization of lung ultrasound may also reduce exposure of healthcare workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 and may mitigate the shortage of personal protective equipment.
32333544, Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.
32333248, With accumulated experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently.
32333248, The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children. In the current version, diagnosis and treatement criteria have been optimized, and early identification of severe and critical cases is highlighted.
32333248, The early warning indicators for severe pediatric cases have been summarized which is utmost important for clinical practice.
32333248, This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.
32332765, The fusion proteins are then characterized.
32332765, Both fusion proteins have a high binding affinity for the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit desirable pharmacological properties in mice.
32332765, Moreover, the fusion proteins neutralize virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in vitro.
32332765, As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they have potential applications in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32331845, In this Special Article, we examine the current and expected impact of the pandemic on individuals with ADRD.

32329881, All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab.
32329881, Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers.
32329881, Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.
32329881, Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.
32329659,Concerns about the prevention and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as it is crucial in contagious epidemics that travel and transfer of the patients be minimal for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups.
32329659, Telemedicine or telehealth can play an important role, especially with previous successful experiences in the management of acute infectious respiratory epidemics such as SARS and MERS.
32329659, In order to better control the rapid spread of coronavirus and manage the COVID-19 crisis, both developed and developing countries can improve the efficiency of their health system by replacing a proportion of face-to-face clinical encounters with telehealth.
32329659, Recent technological advancement facilitates this reform, but there is a need for national or state-wide rules and regulations to be adapted accordingly.
32329276, Spike protein is a special structural protein on the surface of coronavirus.
32329276, It contains important information about the evolution of the virus and plays critical roles in the processes of cellular recognition and entry.
32329276, In the past decades, spike protein has always been one of the most important objects in research works on coronaviruses closely related to human life.
32329276, In this review we introduce these research works related to spike proteins, hoping it will provide reasonable ideas for the control of the current pandemic, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32329275, All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention & control, and others.
32329275, The literatures related to SARS-CoV-2 are emerging rapidly.
32329275, It is necessary to sort out and summarize the research topic in time, which has a good reference value for staff in different positions.
32329275, At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the judgment of the quality of literatures.
32326343, While great resources are understandably being dedicated to treatment and diagnosis, more efforts could be dedicated to limit the virus spread.
32326343, Increasing the efficacy of personal protection equipment, developing synergistic antiviral coatings, are only two of the cases discussed.
32326343, This is not the first nor the last pandemic: our nanomaterials community may offer several technological solutions to challenge the ongoing and future global health emergencies.
32326343, Readers' feedback and suggestions are warmly encouraged.
32323011, Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p < 0.05).
32323011, COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05).
32323011, COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05).
32323011, The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.05).Though viral pneumonias generally show similar imaging features, there are some characteristic CT findings which may help differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia.• CT can play an early warning role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the case of no epidemic exposure. • CT could be used for the differential diagnosis of influenza and COVID-19 with satisfactory accuracy. • COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities with peripheral distribution and balanced lobe predomination.
32319971, Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority.
32319971, Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4).
32319971, Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8).
32319971, However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.
32319446, In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19.
32319446, Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention.
32319446, We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities.
32319446, An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.

32318325, Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases.
32318325, Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors.There were more men than women among critically ill patients.
32318325, All of the cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography and the vast majority of patients displayed fever and dry cough.

32317591, The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53-1.08]; range, 0.16-1.40).
32317591, The FIO2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05).
32317591, The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32-45%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones.In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait.
32317591, These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.
32317558, The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions.
32317558, The COVID-19 disease appeared mild, without major respiratory problems, and no obvious neuromuscular deterioration was reported or observed.
32317558, Telerehabilitation provided an opportunity to continue with hand rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery, perform an ad-hoc online evaluation, and advise the patient how to prevent the spread of infection and cope with restrictions limiting outpatient visits.
32317558, This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits.
32317557, As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital.
32317557, Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32317557, Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.
32317557, These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.
32317153, Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally.
32317153, The hospital pharmacy department timely adjusted the work mode, and the formed management practices is a powerful guarantee for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

32316712, Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation.
32316712, During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
32316712, When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them.
32316712, At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.
32315725, The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively.We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness.
32315725, The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32315725, Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32314699,The early shortage of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) tests in the United States led many hospitals to first screen for common respiratory pathogens, and only if this screen was negative to proceed with COVID-19 testing.
32314699, We report a case of a 56-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coinfection with group A Streptococcus.
32314699, The initial testing strategy resulted in delays in both diagnosis and implementation of appropriate precautions.
32314699, Underlined is the importance of testing for both SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory pathogens during the current pandemic.
32314685, The patient's respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals, antibiotics, and intensive supportive care.
32314685, He required intubation and was given a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin to modulate his likely aberrant immune response.
32314685, Subsequently, the patient's clinical status improved, and after 8 days of hospitalization, he was transferred out of the country, where he recovered.
32314685, This was a learning experience for the treating medical staff, the government, and the people of Bhutan.
32314249, In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery.
32314249, Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging.
32314249, Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
32314058,This document from the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) aims to present the main imaging features, and the role of CT scan in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, describing, in particular, the typical findings which make it possible to identify the disease and distinguish it from bacterial causes of infection, and to define which category of patients may benefit from CT imaging.
32314058, The precautions that must be taken when performing scans to protect radiologists and technologists from infection will be described.
32314058, The organisational measures that can be taken within radiology departments in order to cope with the influx of patients, while continuing to manage other emergency and time-sensitive activity (e.g. oncology, other infectious diseases etc.), will be discussed.
32314058, KEY POINTS: • Bilateral ground glass opacities are typical CT manifestations of COVID-19. • Crazy paving and organising pneumonia pattern are seen at a later stage. • Extensive consolidation is associated with a poor prognosis.
32313886, He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant.
32313886, Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD.
32313886, When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected.

32312290, Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO2/FiO2 of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria).
32312290, Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated.
32312290, Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature.The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients.
32312290, When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.
32312064, For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment.
32312064, For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions.
32312064, Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation.
32312064, Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.
32312018, The data of these three aspects will be analyzed synthetically.This study will help us to identify the chest CT features of COVID-19 and its mechanism.This retrospective study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (No. 2020-140).

32311350, At the time of the report, 3 pregnancies were ongoing; of the remaining 48 pregnant women, 46 gave birth by cesarean delivery, and 2 gave birth vaginally; in this study, 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death were reported.Although vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and neonates has been generally good, the high rate of preterm delivery by cesarean delivery is a reason for concern.
32311350, Cesarean delivery was typically an elective surgical intervention, and it is reasonable to question whether cesarean delivery for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was warranted.

32310921, In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital.
32310921, The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments.
32310921, Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.
32310921, A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.
32310920, Bedside pulmonary ultrasound presents an undeniable series of advantages in patients at high risk of infection, and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient, as well as for home delivery of stabilized patients.
32310920, Chest X-ray is characterized by low sensitivity in identifying earlier lung changes.
32310920, Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative, and in the late phase imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach.
32310920, Echocardiography should be limited to patients with hemodynamic instability.
32310916, The highest mortality rate was detected among patients with both progressively incremental troponin levels and a history of cardiovascular disease.
32310916, Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration.
32310916, In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels.
32310916, In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.
32309388, We report the screening and diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital.Developed a procedure for the identification of children cases with COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency department of our hospital, then we observed how this process works.(I) There were 56 cases considered suspected cases, and 10 cases were confirmed as COVID-19. (II) Of the 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in our hospital, 5 were males and 5 were females, aged from 7 months to 11 years, the average age is 6.0±4.2 years, 6 cases were mild pneumonia, the others were upper respiratory tract infection. (III) We followed up 68 patients in isolation at home until symptoms disappeared.
32309388, Non were missed in the patient's first visit.
32309388, The sensitivity of this method is 100% and the specificity is 71.3%.Our screening process works well, and it is also necessary to establish a screening network in the hospital.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32309266, Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.
32309266, Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome.
32309266, In line with the current opinion of the WHO, we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of COVID-19 are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks.
32309266, We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission.The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide.Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies.Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.© EFIM 2020.

32307298, BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).
32307298, Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in HLH patients (Valade et al., 2015).
32307298, OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HLH with neurological involvement to prevent serious complications and demise.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
32307298, All rights reserved.
32307014, To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19.
32307014, Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.
32307014, This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention.
32307014, The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.
32306864, Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases.
32306864, On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers.
32306864, The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period.
32306864, Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design.
32306118, An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.
32306118, Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed.
32306118, Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
32306118, Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.
32306015, However, community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary hospitals with Internet.
32306015, Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare system should promote emergence ehealth.
32306015, Tele-medical diagnosis and referral should be developed by local governments during COVID-19.
32306015, The application of "Internet+medical treatment" in community medical institutions and synergy among various institutions should be promoted.
32305937, Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification.
32305937, Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis.
32305937, In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.
32305937, We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.
32305181, Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients.
32305181, In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations.
32305181, The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.Copyright © 2020.

32302459, During viral outbreaks, pregnancy poses a uniquely increased risk to women due to changes to immune function, alongside physiological adaptive alterations, such as increased oxygen consumption and edema of the respiratory tract.
32302459, The laboratory derangements may be reminiscent of HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, and thus knowledge of the COVID-19 relationship is paramount for appropriate diagnosis and management.
32302459, In addition to routine measurements of D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all patients presenting with COVID-19 as per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidance, monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen levels should be considered in pregnancy, as highlighted in this report.
32302459, These investigations in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID-19 infection, and may warrant pre-emptive admission and consideration of delivery to achieve maternal stabilization.© 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

32301761, Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom.
32301761, Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P < 0.001).
32301761, Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms.We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms.
32301761, These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.
32301692, The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations.
32301692, In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues.
32301692, The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff.
32301692, In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.
32301631, CONCLUSION.
32301631, COVID-19 infection can present primarily with abdominal symptoms, and the abdominal radiologist must suggest the diagnosis when evaluating the lung bases for typical findings.
32301478, If a confirmed case requires laboratory testing, what is the population who are laboratory-tested? Due to limited laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of an emerging epidemic, only "suspected cases" are laboratory-tested in most countries.
32301478, This will result in underdiagnosis of confirmed cases and also raises the question: how is a "suspect case" defined? With the passage of time and increased capability to perform laboratory tests, more people can be screened and the number of confirmed cases will increase.
32301478, What are the technical considerations of laboratory testing? This includes specimen collection (variable collection methods), samples collected (upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory test methods and kits (not all of which may be standardised or approved by authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration).
32301478, Are approved laboratory facilities and trained manpower available, and how are test results interpreted and false-negatives excluded? These issues will affect the accuracy of disease counts, which in turn will have implications on how we mount an appropriate response to the outbreak.
32301198, Hence, the management of these patients with COVID-19 is an area of interest, and a unique approach is warranted.

32301099, There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults.
32301099, There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases.
32301099, The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03).
32301099, Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
32300968, Radiological examinations were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19.
32300968, It is reported that some radiologists and radiological technologists were infected when giving examinations to the patients with COVID-19.
32300968, In order to reduce the infection risk of medical staff in radiology department, we summarized the experience on prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work for radiologists and radiological technologists.
32300968, KEY POINTS: • The novel coronavirus spreads rapidly through droplet and contact transmission. • Radiologists and radiological technologists were possibly infected by patients. • Prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19 are important.
32300823, Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis.
32300823, Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation.
32300823, Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine.Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32300823, Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.
32300673, We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C>T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T>C in ORF8 gene and 29095C>T in the N gene.
32300673, The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
32300673, The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32299304, This 5-item scale, which was based on 775 adults with anxiety over the coronavirus, demonstrated solid reliability and validity.
32299304, Elevated CAS scores were found to be associated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese products.
32299304, The CAS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety using an optimized cut score of ≥ 9 (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity).
32299304, These results support the CAS as an efficient and valid tool for clinical research and practice.
32299201, The national and international institutions of our globe were all communicating and taking precautions in a very fast manner than ever.
32299201, However, this time, unexpectedly, the SARS-CoV-2 contagion was also faster.
32299201, Besides the international organizations like WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, the roles of local authorities, health ministries, disease control centers, health protection agencies, research centers and universities are all very important in different operational levels to control and survive from the pandemic.

32295324, Conclusions: There wasn't any novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis in 81 patients with coronavirus disease-19.(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:).
32295322, Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases.
32295322, The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.
32295188, We performed a narrative review to describe existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective.
32295188, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles.
32295188, Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current state of the art.
32295188, In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and preparedness.
32294858, Conclusion: Most of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection have pulmonary inflammation.CT manifestations include multiple parts, subpleural area or middle and lateral field of lung, ground glass shadow and consolidation, or coexistence.
32294858, Some cases have pleural thickening or interlobular septal thickening.
32294858, CT images can indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide important basis for early detection and disease monitoring.
32294816,The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs.
32294816, One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV.
32294816, Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients.
32294816, The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
32473390, This is one of the suggestive and effective ways to control the spreading of viruses.

32472403, Respondents agree that the switch from minimally invasive to open technique can be considered as a valid option for cases with a high technical complexity.
32472403, Several issues merit specific attention: screening for virus positivity should be universally performed; only expert surgical teams should operate on positive patients and specific technical measures to lower the biological risk of contamination during surgery must be followed.
32472403, Future studies specifically designed to establish the true risks in minimally invasive surgery are suggested.
32472403, Furthermore, a standard and univocal process of prioritization of patients from Regional Healthcare Systems is advisable.
32470577, Promising drug-like compounds were identified, demonstrating better docking score and binding energy for each druggable targets.
32470577, After an extensive screening analysis, three novel multi-target natural compounds were predicted to subdue the activity of three/more major drug targets simultaneously.
32470577, Concerning the utility of natural compounds in the formulation of many therapies, we propose these compounds as excellent lead candidates for the development of therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020.

32466623, Paired FEV1 measurements were included if the measurement on the home monitor was performed on the same day as the FEV1 measurement on the pneumotachometer during a two monthly clinical visit.
32466623, Bland-Altman plots and linear mixed model analysis were used.
32466623, The mean difference (home measurement was subtracted from clinical measurement) in FEV1 was 0.18 L in CF (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.27 L; p < 0.001) and 0.12 L in asthma (95%CI 0.05-0.19 L; p < 0.001).
32466623, FEV1 measurements at home were significantly lower than clinically obtained FEV1 measurements, which has implications for the application of this technique in the daily clinical situation.
32466199, In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters.
32466199, The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one.
32466199, Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE.
32466199, In addition, the priority of two variables, urban parameter, and relative humidity, were the highest to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32462316, Orchitis has been reported as a possible complication of SARS-CoV infection, but similar findings have not been reported for SARS-CoV-2.
32462316, Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome.
32462316, Finally, available data do not support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma seminal fluid of infected subjects.Data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological consultation and evaluation of gonadal function including semen analysis should be suggested.
32462316, Studies in larger cohorts of currently infected subjects are warranted to confirm (or exclude) the presence of risks for male gametes that are destined either for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen or for assisted reproduction techniques.
32461973, Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain.
32461973, Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target.
32461973, Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Miyssa I.

32442035, A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
32442035, Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
32442035, Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
32442035, Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.World Health Organization.

32421497,The global COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the largest clinical and operational challenges faced by emergency medicine, and our EDs continue to see increased volumes of infected patients, many of whom are not only ill, but acutely aware and fearful of their circumstances and potential mortality.
32421497, Given this, there may be no more important time to focus on staff-patient communication and expression of compassion.However, many of the techniques usually employed by emergency clinicians to provide comfort to patients and their families are made more challenging or impossible by the current circumstances.
32421497, Geriatric ED patients, who are at increased risk of severe disease, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of isolation.Despite many challenges, emergency clinicians have at their disposal a myriad of tools that can still be used to express compassion and empathy to their patients.
32421497, Placing emphasis on using these techniques to maximize humanism in the care of COVID-19 patients during this crisis has the potential to bring improvements to ED patient care well after this pandemic has passed.

32323016, The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefits of laparoscopic techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization.
32323016, Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status.
32323016, Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open.
32323016, All emergent endoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic should be considered as high risk and PPE must be used by all endoscopy staff.

32306836, Computer simulation is particularly suitable to complement experiments to elucidate conformational changes at the molecular level which are related to inhibition process of the COVID-19.
32306836, Therefore, computational simulation is essential tool to elucidate the phenomenon.
32306836, The structure-based virtual screening computational approach will be used to filter the best drugs from the literature, the investigate the structural variation of COVID-19 with the interaction of the best inhibitor is a fundamental step to design new drugs and vaccines which can combat the coronavirus.
32306836, This mini-review will address novel coronavirus structure, mechanism of action, and trial test of antiviral drugs in the lab and patients with COVID-19.
32302284, They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques).
32302284, Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions.
32302284, Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input.
32302284, Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal.
32297723, At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32297723, Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
32297723, Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
32297723, Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
32350047, While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays.
32350047, The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning, given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen and the acceptable specimen types.
32350047, An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate, or perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate.
32350047, Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role in during our global response to this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Theel et al.
