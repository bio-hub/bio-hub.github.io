32473600, In addition, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) are even more exposed, due to increased contact with the population in hospitals and emergency services.
32473600, OMFS should be able to identify a suspected case of COVID-19, its symptoms, risk groups, disease severity, laboratorial and computed tomography alterations, and treatment guidelines.
32473600, In the present study, the authors performed a nationwide survey with Brazilian OMFS to evaluate the knowledge of these professionals about the pandemic status of the COVID-19.
32473600, A total of 142 OMFS replied the survey and the results brings light to an incomparable health public problem that the OMFS in Brazil are no able to protect itself, diagnose the suspicious and probable cases, request and interpret the correct laboratorial examinations for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients.
32473600, The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to generate mild as well as critical courses.
32473600, Complications on the intensive care units include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac, and kidney injury as well as shock.
32473600, Here, we present the first case report of a successful treatment of a COVID-19 patient presenting with adult respiratory distress syndrome plus refractory combined cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock, which could be successfully stabilized after implantation of a percutaneous ventricular assist device plus an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32473600, Although such intense treatment might not be feasible in case of a health care disaster as described for the hot spots of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might encourage treatment of younger patients on intensive care units not overcrowded by critically ill patients.
32473600, No related serious adverse events were reported and mild adverse events resolved spontaneously.
32473600, A trend was found of improved radiographic findings, pulmonary function (lung compliance, tidal volumes, PaO2 /FiO2 ratio, alveolo-capillary injury), and inflammatory biomarker levels.

32473600, Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients.
32473600, The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind.
32473600, Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged.The use of taxis in emergency inguinal hernia is a useful first line of treatment in areas or situations where surgical care is not immediately available, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Emergency surgery remains the mainstay of management in the strangulated hernia setting.
32473600, Drugs that have been used in rheumatology for decades seem to be effective in this infection and are for the most part being studied.
32473600, The rational use of these anti-rheumatic drugs is based on the cytokinic storm (hyperproduction of IL1, IL6, TNF α) in the body by COVID-19 in its severe form.
32473600, In this review, the authors make the difference between the infectious and auto-inflammatory part of COVID-19; the disease does not seem to be a risk factor for admission to the intensive care unit for patients suffering from inflammatory rheumatism; however, the poverty of studies on this subject should be noted.
32473600, The authors also review anti-rheumatic drugs while studying COVID-19 treatment.
32473600, Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19.
32473600, Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach.
32473600, Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients.
32473600, We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points• Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.• No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.• A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.• Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.
32473600, We analyse the impact of the pandemic on the conduct of phase I-II trials for paediatric cancer during the first month of state of alarm in Spain.A questionnaire was sent to all five ITCC-accredited Spanish Paediatric Oncology Early Phase Clinical Trial Units, including questions about impact on staff activities, recruitment, patient care, supply of investigational products, and legal aspects.All units suffered personnel shortages and difficulties in enrolling patients, treatment continuity, or performing trial assessments.
32473600, Monitoring activity was frequently postponed (73%), and 49% of on-going trials interrupted recruitment.
32473600, Only two patients could be recruited during this period (75% reduction in the expected rate).The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted clinical research practice and access to innovation for children with cancer.
32473600, Structural and functional changes are under way to better cope with the expected future restrictions.
32473600, Remarkably, among spectrum of potential mitigation strategies, the Chinese government has implemented all-out lockdowns on large geographical areas, unprecedented in the modern era.
32473600, This inevitably undermined the right to healthcare of many who now faced great difficulty in getting treatment, especially those with cancer or other life-threatening issues.
32473600, We elaborate and discuss the medico-legal and human rights consideration triggered by the lockdowns, the unprecedented mass quarantine of Hubei province in China, and the suspension of normal healthcare services.
32473600, We argue that the same challenge will now be faced by other countries, particularly the USA, Italy, Spain, and France, as the epicentres of COVID-19 has shifted to Europe and the Americas.
32473600, At this time of uncertainty, oncologists are struggling to provide appropriate care to cancer patients.
32473600, They have to weigh risk and benefit of giving cancer treatment vs chances of getting them infected with COVID-19.
32473600, As cancer patients are immunocompromised and there are high chances of exposure during hospital visits and if they get infected, outcome can be fatal.
32473600, So through the column of this article, we would like to provide basic guideline in management of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies.
32473600, In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]).
32473600, On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome.
32473600, Finally, age (OR 2.48 [1.74, 3.53]), treated obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 2.80 [1.46, 5.38]), and microvascular (OR 2.14 [1.16, 3.94]) and macrovascular complications (OR 2.54 [1.44, 4.50]) were independently associated with the risk of death on day 7.In people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19, BMI, but not long-term glucose control, was positively and independently associated with tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days.clinicaltrials.gov NCT04324736.
32473600, The number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (on average 81%; p < 0.001), whereas the number of patients treated on average per week via telephone and via Internet increased (on average 979% and 1561%; both p < 0.001).
32473600, Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (p < 0.001).
32473600, No differences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged.
32473600, Results imply an undersupply of psychotherapy in the COVID-19 lockdown and that further changes are necessary to cover the increased need for timely psychotherapy in times of COVID-19.
32473600, Fenretinide is endowed with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties other than efficacy in obesity/diabetic pathologies.
32473600, Its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, in particular, could likely have utility in multimodal therapies for the treatment of ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Moreover, fenretinide administration by pulmonary delivery systems could further increase its therapeutic value by carrying high drug concentrations to the lungs and triggering a rapid onset of activity.
32473600, This is particularly important in SARS-CoV-2 infection, where only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention.
32473600, The STREAM Clinical Trial is the largest trial for MDR-TB ever conducted.
32473600, Currently operating in seven countries, the trial had 126 participants on treatment and 312 additional participants in active follow up as of March 31, 2020.
32473600, Areas of particular concern during this global emergency include treatment continuity, supply chain management and participant safety monitoring.
32473600, This commentary highlights some of the challenges faced due to the pandemic and the steps taken to protect the safety of trial participants and the integrity of the trial.
32473600, Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses.
32473600, In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results.
32473600, Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate.
32473600, Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 µM, respectively.
32473600,Excess ascorbate (as expected in intravenous treatment proposed for COVID-19 management, for example) oxidizes and/or degrades hemoglobin and albumin, as evidenced by UV-vis spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry.
32473600, It also degrades hemoglobin in intact blood or in isolated erythrocytes.
32473600, The survival rates and metabolic activities of several leukocyte subsets implicated in the antiviral cellular immune response are also affected.
32473600, Excess ascorbate is thus an unselective biological stress agent.
32473600, Breast cancer (BC) is a multifactorial pathology for which there is a continuous need to identify novel drugs.
32473600, Here, I reviewed the possible roles of both axes of the RAS endocrine network as potential druggable pathways in BC.
32473600, Remarkably, the analysis of the current knowledge of the different GPCRs of the RAS molecular system not only confirms that AT1R could be considered a drug target and that its inhibition by losartan and candesartan could be useful in the treatment of BC, but also identifies Mas-related GPCR member D (MRGD) as a druggable protein.
32473600, Overall, the RAS of GPCRs offers multifaceted opportunities for the development of additional compounds for the treatment of BC.
32473600, Although a higher respiratory rate was observed at admission in nonsurvivors, symptoms at presentation were similar between both groups.
32473600, Patients who died were more anemic, lymphopenic and showed higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 at their first tests.

32473600, Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor.
32473600, Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others.
32473600, We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk.
32473600, Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.
32473600, An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein.
32473600, Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies.
32473600, SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples.
32473600, The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.Published by Elsevier B.V.
32473600, Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging.
32473600, Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.
32473600, The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Levels of 7 cytokines were significantly decreased in the ruxolitinib group in comparison to the control group.Although no statistical difference was observed, ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement.
32473600, Significant chest CT improvement, a faster recovery from lymphopenia and favorable side-effect profile in ruxolitinib group were encouraging and informative to future trials to test efficacy of ruxolitinib in a larger population.

32473600, Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3).Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose.
32473600, At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units.Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood.
32473600, Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other.
32473600, Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.
32473600, Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well.This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis.
32473600, Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier.
32473600, The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported.Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms.
32473600, Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.
32473600, Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation.Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020).
32473600, Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact.
32473600, In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations.Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the visitation scheme which may otherwise have put an overwhelming burden on the ACIM.

32473600, Immunotherapy restores immunological activity against cancer cells and it has become a standard treatment for several cancers.
32473600, We carried out an examination of available data concerning with the effects exerted by both SARS-CoV-2 and the most widespread immunotherapy treatments on the immune system in order to hypothesize mechanisms underlying potential and mutual interaction.
32473600, We provided an analysis of laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32473600, We finally focused on implications of immunotherapy treatments in clinical practice.
32473600, Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations.
32473600, Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions.The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations.
32473600, Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Clinical prudence is required in advocating HCQ as a therapeutic armamentarium in COVID-19.
32473600, This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) compared with the placebo group (26%); however, more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%).Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe COVID-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation.
32473600, There is limited safety data for remdesivir, which should be obtained in further studies.
32473600, The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed.
32473600, Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.
32473600, Despite the very fast and large flow of scientific data on possible treatment solutions, none have yet demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
32473600, This work represents an exhaustive and critical review of all available data on potential treatments for COVID‑19, highlighting their mechanistic characteristics and the strategy development rationale.
32473600, Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, and target based methods are the most used strategies to advance therapeutic solutions into clinical practice.
32473600, Current in silico, in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding proposed treatments are summarized providing strong support for future research efforts.
32473600, Most of the data points to the very challenging nature of treating such patients.
32473600, Their overall outcomes seem to be worse than in the general population, and it may be difficult to differentiate which potential complications are a result of the primary oncologic disease versus the infection.
32473600, Management presents its own set of challenges, including but not limited to, deciding whether postponing cancer treatment until the infection resolves is going to benefit the patient and how to organize all aspects of patient care when social contact is as limited as it is for patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19.
32473600, We believe that as more data becomes available, it is going to be necessary to publish detailed guidelines on how to approach this unique clinical challenge.Copyright © 2020, Cancarevic et al.
32473600, Performing appendectomy in acute appendicitis patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is challenging, as it involves considerable operative risks for the patients and risks for health care professionals (HCPs) exposed to COVID-19.
32473600, Medical management eliminates the morbidity and mortality associated with surgery but involves significant risks of treatment failures that, in turn, may lead to perforation, peritonitis, and death. We are reporting a case of a middle-aged man with multiple co-morbidities, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and acute appendicitis.
32473600, Our patient received intravenous antibiotics for seven days with a significant improvement in symptoms.
32473600, Our case report illustrates the implementation of successful conservative treatment for acute appendicitis in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020, Suwanwongse et al.
32473600, Viral RNA copy number dropped by 50-66% after 80°C heating for 20 min.
32473600, Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min.
32473600, These results indicated that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false negative results especially in weakly positive cases.
32473600, Thus, TRIzol is recommended for sample inactivation in comparison to heat inactivation as Trizol has the least effect on RNA copy number among the tested methods.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32473600, The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion.After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient.
32473600, Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55 × 104 to 1.39 × 103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion.With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries.
32473600, The successful treatment of this 100-year-old patient using convalescent plasma suggests that we should consider adding convalescent plasma in th management of the elderly.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Although there is as yet no evidence that the virus causing COVID-19 might have negative effects on IVF outcomes, fertility treatments have been postponed in order to support healthcare systems by avoiding placing them under additional stress.
32473600, The possibility of the virus affecting sperm function and egg performance cannot be excluded.
32473600, In addition, an indirect effect of the virus on gametes and embryos during their manipulation cannot be ruled out.
32473600, This commentary aims to provide some ideas on the possible effect of the virus on gametes and embryos, as well as how it could affect the normal functioning of the embryology laboratory.Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32473600, Five received intravenous alteplase.
32473600, All patients had mechanical thrombectomy.
32473600, Nine patients achieved successful recanalization (mTICI2B-3), none experienced early neurological improvement, 4 had early cerebral reocclusion, and a total of 6 patients (60%) died in the hospital.Best medical care including early intravenous thrombolysis, and successful and prompt recanalization achieved with mechanical thrombectomy, resulted in poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
32473600, Although our results require further confirmation, a different pharmacological approach (antiplatelet or other) should be investigated to take in account inflammatory and coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19.
32473600, Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care.
32473600, MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments.
32473600, For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment.
32473600, The indications proposed in this protocol could support clinicians for the temporary management of ECC until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends.
32473600, Key ethical, quality, and safety guidance for the selection of donors, the collection and processing of blood, and the transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma should be followed.
32473600, Governments should be reminded that an adequate supply of quality and safe blood components for transfusion is essential to meet the primary healthcare needs of the population.

32473600, For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
32473600, After the initial rollout and several "hygiene inspections" only minor improvements to the concept were necessary.
32473600, All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.
32473600, Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a dynamic process with regular changes in the development and information status, the operational concept is regularly reviewed for validity and adjusted as necessary.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of angiotesnin II and, in addition, they might even be involved in preventing the cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function.
32473600, AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe.
32473600, Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600, However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS.In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19.
32473600, In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection.

32473600, Without approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines to this ongoing global threat, type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are currently being evaluated for their efficacy.
32473600, Both the role of IFNs and the use of recombinant IFNs in two related, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been controversial in terms of their protective effects in the host.
32473600, In this review, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of both type I and type III IFN-mediated innate antiviral responses against human coronaviruses and discuss the potential use of IFNs as a treatment strategy for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Off-label treatment with tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of NK cells.In conclusion, the association between IL-6 serum levels and the impairment of cytotoxic activity suggests the possibility that targeting this cytokine may restore anti-viral mechanisms.This study was supported by funds of Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine of University of Florence (ex-60%) derived from Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca (Italy).
32473600, In this commentary, the authors describe the ethical rationale and implementation details for the creation of a novel, multidisciplinary treatment prioritization committee, including physicians, frontline staff, an ethicist, and an infectious disease expert.
32473600, Organizational obligations to health care workers also are discussed.
32473600, The treatment prioritization committee sets a threshold of acceptable harm to patients from decreased cancer control that is justified to reduce risk to staff.
32473600, The creation of an ethical, consistent, and transparent decision-making process involving such frontline stakeholders is essential as departments across the country are faced with decisions regarding the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with cancer.© 2020 American Cancer Society.
32473600, These differences centre on the nature of their health services; the extent of attention given to older people (and the circumstances that can relate to them); the different geographies (notably concerned with rurality) and the changes to funding frameworks that impact on these.
32473600, Common to all three countries is the value attributed to maintaining quality safeguards in the wider context of their health services but where such services are noted as sometimes having precluded significant telehealth use.The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing changes and may help to establish telehealth more firmly in its aftermath.
32473600, Some of the changes may not be long-lasting.
32473600, However, the momentum is such that telehealth will almost certainly find a stronger place within health service frameworks for each of the three countries and is likely to have increased acceptance among both patients and healthcare providers.
32473600, Chloroquine interacts with multiple cardiac ion channels including the hERG potassium channel that is essential for normal electrical activity in the heart.
32473600, A reduction in hERG channel potassium current is the principle cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome.
32473600, Azithromycin also can cause modest QT interval prolongation, but not through potent hERG channel blockade, rather when used chronically through an increase in peak and late cardiac sodium current to cause potential loading of cardiomyocytes with sodium and calcium to produce calcium overload.
32473600, How should we proceed with the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially combined with azithromycin, for COVID-19 given that these agents bring some cardiac toxicity risk and their mechanisms for cardiac toxicity may not be the same? Is combining different and potentially additive mechanisms of cardiotoxicity wise? How great the risk is relative to the benefit in critically ill COVID-19 patients will need to await the outcome of ongoing, controlled clinical trials.
32473600, Specifically, impaired redox homeostasis and associated oxidative stress appear to be important biological processes that may account for increased individual susceptibility to diverse environmental insults.
32473600, The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness.
32473600, The hypothesis that glutathione deficiency is the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in COVID-19 patients was proposed on the basis of an exhaustive literature analysis and observations.
32473600, The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.
32473600, There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department.
32473600, In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients.There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic.
32473600, The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients.
32473600, The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.
32473600, Current policy has significant implications for increased cost and harm to both these patients and the US healthcare system.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600, In this work, we have utilized docking and simulation methods to identify small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins, which are essential for virus assembly and budding.
32473600, A total of 70 compounds from an Indian medicinal plant source (Azadirachta indica or Neem) were virtually screened against these two proteins and further analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations, which resulted in the identification of a few common compounds with strong binding to both structural proteins.
32473600, The compounds bind to biologically critical regions of M and E, indicating their potential to inhibit the functionality of these components.
32473600, We hope that our computational approach may result in the identification of effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 assembly.
32473600, The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2µM and 30µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin respectively.
32473600, Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than uridine monophosphate (UMP).
32473600, Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å2 by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide.
32473600, However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.Abbreviation: COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease 2019; PCA: Principal Component Analysis; MD: Molecular Dynamics; MM/PBSA: Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area; nCoV: Novel Coronavirus; PME: Particle-Mesh Ewald; RMSD: Root Mean Square Deviations; RMSF: Root Mean Square Fluctuations; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2; SASA: Solvent Accessible Surface Area; SPC: Simple Point Charge.
32473600, Gold nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots in colorimetric and immunochromatographic assays, silica nanoparticles in a polymerase chain reaction and spike protein nanospheres as antigen carriers and adjuvants in vaccine formulations present notable examples in diagnostics and prevention, while uses of nanoparticles in coronavirus infection treatments have been merely sporadic.
32473600, The current absence of antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, might be largely due to the underuse of nanotechnologies.
32473600, Elucidating the interface between nanoparticles and coronaviruses is timely, but presents the only route to the rational design of precisely targeted therapeutics for coronavirus infections.
32473600, Such a fundamental approach is also a viable prophylaxis against future pandemics of this type.
32473600, We have summarized several recommendations here, hoping to help surgeons from related departments across the world.

32473600, There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32473600, These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease.
32473600, Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, There were insufficient data to compare across treatments.
32473600, Many treatments have been administered to the first 9152 reported cases of COVID-19.
32473600, These data serve as the basis for an open-source registry of all reported treatments given to COVID-19 patients at www.CDCN.org/CORONA.
32473600, Further work is needed to prioritize drugs for investigation in well-controlled clinical trials and treatment protocols.
32473600, All medical staff should undergo rigorous training on infection control and the use of high-quality personal protection equipment.
32473600, Cardiologists should promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritize outpatient contacts, and avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers.
32473600, A much conservative approach for emergent cardiac patients is recommended, and invasive interventions are reserved for high risk hemodynamically unstable patients.
32473600, During the pandemic, the most important principles of treatment should be controlling the spread of infection as the first priority, prompt assessment of patient risk, recommending conservative medical therapy rather than invasive interventions, and strict infection control measures to limit infection spread within the hospital and to healthcare workers.
32473600, Patients with SSc need a close follow-up with a regular screening of organ involvement and frequent intravenous treatments.
32473600, All SSc patients have been educated about ministerial directives to limit COVID-19 spread.
32473600, The organization of our Scleroderma Unit has been quickly rethought to assure SSc patients assistance in safety for them and for health-care workers during urgent visits or infusion therapies.
32473600, Using electronic way of communication with frequent virtual contact and guarantying home deliveries of some therapies, we allowed a continuity of care also outside the Hospital.
32473600, Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes.
32473600, Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis.
32473600, Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome.
32473600, A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.
32473600, Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes.
32473600, As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified.
32473600, As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn.
32473600, As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention.
32473600, Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed.
32473600, Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested.
32473600, Finally, this assessment process could help the government and policymakers to judge the public perceptions to deal with COVID-19 pandemic in densely populated lower-middle-income and limited-resource countries like Bangladesh.© 2020 The Author(s).
32473600, We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R0t .The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R0t is still larger than the threshold 1.
32473600, The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan.
32473600, Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP.
32473600, Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Yu Zhao et al.
32473600, Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain.
32473600, Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target.
32473600, Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Miyssa I.

32473600, At any time, the arriving waves of the pandemic are testing the capacity of governments.
32473600, The health services struggle to keep the plateau in a steady-state below 100 deaths per million inhabitants.
32473600, Therefore, it is necessary to increase the alternatives and supplies based on the current and near-future expected demands imposed by the number of deaths by COVID-19.
32473600, Estimating COVID-19 mortality in various scenarios with the gradual release of social constraints will help predict the magnitude of those arriving waves.
32473600, Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.
32473600, Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself.
32473600, The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation.
32473600, The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death.
32473600, In this review we will discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multi-organ damage.Copyright © 2020.

32473600,As the Covid-19 pandemic escalates worldwide it is apparent that many patients with more severe illness will also experience delirium.
32473600, These patients pose a particular challenge in the application of optimal care due to issues with infectious risk, respiratory compromise and potential interactions between medications that can be used to manage delirium with antiviral and other treatments used for Covid-19.
32473600, We describe a guidance resource adapted from existing guidelines for delirium management that has been tailored to the specific challenge of managing delirium in patients with Covid-19 infection.
32473600, Issues around the assessment and treatment of these patients are examined and distilled into a simple (one-paged guidance resource that can assist clinicians in managing suspected delirium.
32473600, The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment.
32473600, After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment.
32473600, Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition.
32473600, This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.
32473600, At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19.
32473600, All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities.
32473600, In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (> 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.
32473600, Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.
32473600, Conclusions: Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients.
32473600, Recognition and antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.
32473600, We examined the in vitro activity of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2, at concentrations which can be used to treat coronavirus-19 patients with little concern of toxicity.Lopinavir/ritonavir (7/1.75 μg/mL), hydroxychloroquine base (1 or 2 μg/mL), or a combination thereof were administered 1 hour after the inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 to Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05.
32473600, We examined cytopathic effects of virus 48 hours after administration of the respective treatments and measured viral loads at three time points (0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared the results obtained from the different antiviral regimens tested.The severity of cytopathic effects was lower in lopinavir/ritonavir-treated cells, and viral load was significantly reduced in this group compared with the control group (p < 0.001).
32473600, However, hydroxychloroquine did not show significant inhibitory effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytotoxicity or on viral load at either concentration.Lopinavir/ritonavir showed significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at its usual plasma concentration.
32473600, However, the in vitro antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine at concentrations commonly used in humans was minimal, whether used alone or in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.
32473600, Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened.A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5).
32473600, Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation.
32473600, During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization.The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis.
32473600, LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.
32473600, Australia has the highest incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in the world.
32473600, NMSC is predominantly a cancer of the middle aged or elderly and accounts for considerable consulting and treatment time in most radiation oncology departments.
32473600, Many patients also suffer from medical co-morbidity, an important factor in any treatment decision.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, In 57% of patients, the immunosuppressive therapy was not changed and only 3 patients were treated with chloroquine.
32473600, Most patients recovered without experimental anti-viral therapy.Modification of the immunosuppressive regimen alone could be a therapeutic option for SOT recipients suffering from moderate to severe COVID-19.

32473600,Since there is still no definitive conclusion regarding which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most effective and safe in viral respiratory infections, we decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections so that we can reach a conclusion on which NSAID is best choice for COVID-19.A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020.
32473600, Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included.Six clinical trials were included.
32473600, No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections.
32473600, Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections.
32473600, In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalization in patients with pneumonia due to influenza.Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence.
32473600, Naproxen may be a good choice for future clinical trials.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation.
32473600, Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs. 11%, p-value 0.06).The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common pediatric medical conditions.
32473600, We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation.
32473600, Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections.
32473600, Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54% in the 10-day group.
32473600, After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P = 0.14).
32473600, The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%).In patients with severe Covid-19 not requiring mechanical ventilation, our trial did not show a significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir.

32473600, Even assuming that only half are, at least 7% of Italians and 10% in Lombardy had been affected by Covid-19.
32473600, To these, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases have to be added.
32473600, These estimates are at least one or two orders of magnitude larger than official registered cases.
32473600, This has major implications for cancer prevention, management and treatment.
32473600,As a result of the coronavirus disease pandemic, commercial hand hygiene products have become scarce and World Health Organization (WHO) alcohol-based hand rub formulations containing ethanol or isopropanol are being produced for hospitals worldwide.
32473600, Neither WHO formulation meets European Norm 12791, the basis for approval as a surgical hand preparation, nor satisfies European Norm 1500, the basis for approval as a hygienic hand rub.
32473600, We evaluated the efficacy of modified formulations with alcohol concentrations in mass instead of volume percentage and glycerol concentrations of 0.5% instead of 1.45%. Both modified formulations met standard requirements for a 3-minute surgical hand preparation, the usual duration of surgical hand treatment in most hospitals in Europe.
32473600, Contrary to the originally proposed WHO hand rub formulations, both modified formulations are appropriate for surgical hand preparation after 3 minutes when alcohol concentrations of 80% wt/wt ethanol or 75% wt/wt isopropanol along with reduced glycerol concentration (0.5%) are used.
32473600, In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.
32473600, Evidence was conflicting and insufficient regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on such outcomes as all-cause mortality, progression to severe disease, clinical symptoms, and upper respiratory virologic clearance with antigen testing.
32473600, Several studies found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine developed a QTc interval of 500 ms or greater, but the proportion of patients with this finding varied among the studies.
32473600, Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation.
32473600, An observational study that compared adults with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine phosphate 500 mg once or twice daily with patients not receiving chloroquine found minor fever resolution and virologic clearance benefits with chloroquine.There were few controlled studies, and control for confounding was inadequate in observational studies.Evidence on the benefits and harms of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 is very weak and conflicting.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
32473600, In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
32473600, The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
32473600, This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.
32473600, Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.
32473600, Here, we applied a molecular docking method to study the binding stability of these drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32473600, It appeared that the ligand-protein binding stability of the alliin and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex was better than others.
32473600, The results suggested that alliin may serve as a good candidate as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32473600, Therefore, the present research may provide some meaningful guidance for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace.
32473600, In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients.
32473600, In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state.
32473600, Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
32473600,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed health care, challenged by resource constraints and fears of transmission.
32473600, We report the surgical practice pattern changes in a Head and Neck Surgery department of a tertiary cancer care center and discuss the issues surrounding multidisciplinary care during the pandemic.We report data regarding outpatient visits, multidisciplinary treatment planning conference, surgical caseload, and modifications of oncologic therapy during this pandemic and compared this data to the same interval last year.We found a 46.7% decrease in outpatient visits and a 46.8% decrease in surgical caseload, compared to 2019.
32473600, We discuss the factors involved in the decision-making process and perioperative considerations.Surgical practice patterns in head and neck oncologic surgery will continue to change with the evolving pandemic.
32473600, Despite constraints, we strive to prioritize and balance the oncologic and safety needs of patients with head and neck cancer in the face of COVID-19.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32473600, In summary, ACEI/ARB therapy did not aggravate disease severity of COVID-19.
32473600, Besides, ACEI/ARB therapy can decrease the mortality of COVID-19.
32473600, Current evidence suggested that RAAS inhibitors should be continued in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
32473600, Future well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
32473600, Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32473600, Currently, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, two chloroquine derivatives, are under clinical use.
32473600, Although these two agents exhibit similar mechanisms of drug actions, there is a difference between these two chemicals in terms of target populations, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions.
32473600, This paper summarizes the currently available data and experiences from clinical treatment for malaria with chloroquine drugs, so as to provide insights into the more rational use of chloroquine agents for the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, There are ongoing concerns on the use of laparoscopic procedures, related to the possible contamination of the staff working in the operation room.

32473600, Therefore, the ongoing care of patients receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin is likely to be compromised amid this unprecedented crisis.
32473600, This article discusses a stepwise algorithm for the management of outpatient warfarin therapy.
32473600, Alternative management strategies are presented and discussed, including alternative pharmacological therapy options and self-monitoring.
32473600, Our algorithm aims to help clinicians safely optimize the treatment of patients requiring anticoagulation therapy in the context of the global response to the current pandemic.
32473600, Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression.
32473600, We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision.
32473600, This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.
32473600, We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
32473600, Using bromhexine at a dosage that selectively inhibits TMPRSS2 and, in so doing, inhibits TMPRSS2-specific viral entry is likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, We propose the use of bromhexine as a prophylactic and treatment.
32473600, We encourage the scientific community to assess bromhexine clinically as a prophylactic and curative treatment.
32473600, If proven to be effective, this would allow a rapid, accessible, and cost-effective application worldwide.
32473600, Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19+ patients.
32473600, This has made a strong impact on inpatient management, with the need of a dedicated staff, patient isolation and restrictive visiting hour policies.
32473600, On the other hand, outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contacts between patients and the hospital personnel, with considerable consequences on post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice.In this review, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the orthopaedic practice.
32473600, Particular attention will be dedicated to opportune surgical indication, perioperative care and safe management of both inpatients and outpatients, also considering repercussions of the pandemic on resident education and ethical implications.
32473600, Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection.
32473600, Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs.
32473600, Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication.
32473600, Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, A comparison was performed between the clinicopathological features of the patients in each group as was the changing incidence of AA.A total of 378 patients were identified, 237 in Group A and 141 in Group B (62.7% vs. 37.3%).
32473600, Following the onset of COVID-19, the weekly incidence of AA decreased by 40.7% (p = 0.02).
32473600, There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the length of preoperative symptoms or surgery, need for postoperative peritoneal drainage or the distribution of complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis.The significant decrease in the number of patients admitted with AA during the onset of COVID-19 possibly represents successful resolution of mild appendicitis treated symptomatically by patients at home.
32473600, Further research is needed to corroborate this assumption and identify those patients who may benefit from this treatment pathway.
32473600, The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ.
32473600, Infusions of epinephrine titrated to treat unstable hypotension, as well as potassium for severe hypokalemia may be required.
32473600, Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease.
32473600, Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution.
32473600, The patient showed no response to steroid therapy and died on the eighth day of admission.COVID-19 may be associated with an acute severe encephalopathy and, in this case, was considered most likely to represent an immune-mediated phenomenon.

32473600, Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in pre-clinical studies, without causing NP-C disease.
32473600, Inhibition of NPC1 may impair viral SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via several lipid-dependent mechanisms, which disturb the microenvironment optimum for viral infectivity.

32473600, A total of 100 μM of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV.
32473600, Interestingly, the combination of 100 μM of HCQ and 104 U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-ω (rfIFN-ω, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection.
32473600, Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-ω are applicable for treatment of FIP.
32473600, Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.
32473600, Beneficial effects of the combined therapy were also seen in TCM syndrome score of cough (MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.34 to -1.03, p < 0.001), fever (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.45, p < 0.001), dry and sore throat (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.20, p = 0.009), and fatigue (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.17, p = 0.007).
32473600, The overall risk of bias of the included studies was unclear.
32473600, No serious adverse events were reported.Significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine were found, and revealed the potential role of herbal medicine in treating COVID-19.
32473600, More high-quality RCTs are needed to further validate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600,The recent novel coronavirus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has developed into an international pandemic affecting millions of individuals with hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.
32473600, The highly infectious nature and widespread prevalence of this disease create a new set of obstacles for the bladder cancer community in both delivering and receiving care.
32473600, In this manuscript, we address the unique issues regarding treatment prioritization for the patient with bladder cancer and how we at City of Hope have adjusted our clinical practices using a team-based approach that utilizes shared decision making with all stakeholders (physicians, patients, caregivers) to optimize outcomes during this difficult time.
32473600, In addition to taking standard precautions for minimizing COVID-19 risk of exposure for those entering a healthcare facility (screening all personnel upon entry and donning facemasks at all times), we suggest the following three measures: (1) delay post-treatment surveillance visits until there is a decrease in local COVID-19 cases, (2) continue curative intent treatments for localized bladder cancer with COVID-19 precautions (i.e., choosing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) over dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (ddMVAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and (3) increase the off-treatment period between cycles of palliative systemic therapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.
32473600, Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor.
32473600, Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents.
32473600, In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
32473600, Conclusions: The clinical course of COVID-19 can exacerbate rapidly from mild to critical with lung, liver and heart injuries.
32473600, Steadily increased inflammation indices are suggestive of irreversible disease progression and worse outcome.
32473600, In the early stages of the disease, the progress of the disease should be closely observed and evaluated, and the factors related to the progress of the disease should be identified and managed.
32473600, Patients with preexisting cardio-vascular conditions are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms and worse outcome.
32473600, Data also suggest that cancer patients are particularly vulnerable, but differences between tumor entities and cancer treatments may exist.

32473600, Further structural studies revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct interface-residue competition.
32473600, Our results suggest CB6 deserves further clinical translation.
32473600, In the absence of vaccines or direct therapy for COVID-19, extracorporeal therapies could represent an option to prevent organ failure and improve survival.
32473600, The enormous demand in care for COVID-19 patients requires an immediate response from the scientific community.
32473600, Thus, a detailed review of the available technology is provided by experts followed by a series of recommendation based on current experience and opinions, while waiting for generation of robust evidence from trials.© 2020 S.

32473600, There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches.
32473600, Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.
32473600, Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity & mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis & osteoarthritis patients alike.
32473600, Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells.
32473600, Our review suggests that more samples should be taken and saved systematically, following minimum standards, and data be made available, to maximize healthspan & minimize frailty, leading to savings in health care, gains in quality of life, and preparing us better for the next pandemic, all at the same time.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, We have developed guidelines at our academic cancer center to standardize management of patients with lung cancer across our health care system and provide guidance to the larger oncology community.
32473600, We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression.
32473600, We recognize that our recommendations may change over time based on clinical resources and the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, In principle, however, treatment paradigms must continue to be individualized, with careful consideration of risks and benefits of continuing or altering lung cancer-directed therapy.
32473600, Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia and hypotension resolved.
32473600, Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-α, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations.
32473600, This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade.
32473600, The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with MIS-C temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation.
32473600, The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).
32473600, Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list.
32473600, The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately.
32473600, The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.
32473600, This may include decreased mobility, reduction in overall health status and increase of opioid use with the associated risks.The article is the work of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) COVID-19 Task Force to evaluate the policies set forth by federal, state, and local agencies to reduce or eliminate elective procedures for those patients with pain from spine, nerve and joint disease.
32473600, The impact of these decisions, which were needed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, led to a delay in care for many patients.
32473600, We hence review an emergence plan to reinitiate this pain-related care.
32473600, The goal is to outline a path to work with federal, state, and local authorities to combat the spread of the pandemic and minimize the deleterious impact of pain and suffering on our chronic pain patients.The paper sets forth a strategy for the interventional pain centers to reemerge from the current pandemic and to set a course for future events.
32473600, The Ironbound Initiative, a student group at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey, has partnered with Mantena Global Care, a Brazilian CBO in Newark, to facilitate dissemination of COVID-19-relevant information.
32473600, Medical student volunteers, removed from their clinical duties, serve as virtual patient navigators, using social media to reach community members with the goals of improving awareness of precautions to take during the pandemic and of increasing access to needed medical care.
32473600, These students have collaborated with colleagues in other disciplines to provide necessary legal guidance to community members fearful of seeking care because of their immigration status.
32473600, The authors urge other academic institutions across the country to recruit multidisciplinary teams of medical, health professional, and law students invested in their local communities and to empower students to partner with CBOs, immigrant community leaders, faith-based organizations, hospitals, and local authorities to support these vulnerable communities during this crisis.
32473600, There was no significant delay in arrival to the operating room for patients undergoing point-of-care screening immediately prior to their procedure (P = .92).Currently, few studies address preoperative screening for COVID-19.
32473600, A substantial proportion of individuals in this cohort tested positive, and both protocols identified positive cases.
32473600, The major strengths of the point-of-care protocol are ease of administration, avoiding subsequent exposures after testing, and relieving strain on "COVID-19 clinics" or other community testing facilities.Preoperative screening is a critical aspect of safe surgical practice in the midst of the widespread pandemic.
32473600, Rapid implementation of universal point-of-care screening is possible without major workflow adjustments or operative delays.
32473600, Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices.
32473600, The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment.
32473600, A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection.
32473600, The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.
32473600, The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
32473600, Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
32473600, This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.

32473600, Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed.
32473600, In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a significant reduction in healthcare (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignancies of the musculoskeletal system.
32473600, Delaying or stopping these treatments is life-threatening or can cause severe morbidity, pain, and loss of function.
32473600, Although the coronavirus disease causes severe medical complications, serious collateral damage including death due to delayed or untreated sarcomas should be avoided.
32473600, The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients.
32473600, The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country.
32473600, The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively.
32473600, As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic.Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%. The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.

32473600, We agree with the authors that, despite conflicting clinical data to date, it is possible that HCQ may have a protective effect in the setting of COVID-19.
32473600, More importantly, we agree that optimal HCQ dosage and timing is a critical underpinning for clinical trials.
32473600, However, we highlight several considerations regarding treatment with high dose HCQ.
32473600, This may result in underutilisation of available resources.

32473600, The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men.The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China.
32473600, We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging.
32473600, Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies.The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.
32473600, The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.
32473600, Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature.
32473600, In the context of COVID-19, clinicians will have to determine whether liver injury is related to an underlying liver disease, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, direct effect of the virus, or a complicated disease course.
32473600, Recent studies proposed several theories on potential mechanisms of liver injury in these patients.
32473600, This review summarizes current evidence related to hepatobiliary complications in COVID-19, provides an overview of the available case series and critically elucidates the proposed mechanisms and provides recommendations for clinicians.
32473600, Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19.
32473600, We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents.

32473600, Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.
32473600, The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes' function and platelet adhesion.

32473600, One or sum of diverse mechanisms might work against the viral infections and help prevent more deaths.
32473600, Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.

32473600, After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223-1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368-1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218-1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273-1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.
32473600, Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935-2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106-5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760-4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344-4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.
32473600, Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Apparently there is no feedback control over the antibody production.
32473600, The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype associated negative control of antibody production.
32473600, Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, knowing the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells.
32473600, The use of these two immunotherapeutic tools is understandable on the grounds of basic immunology, whose knowledge may direct the medical community in efforts to fight the virus.
32473600, The interaction between immunosuppression and new antiviral drugs in the treatment of transplanted patients contracting COVID-19 has not yet been fully investigated.

32473600, Mortality was associated with older median age, adjusted by staging and histology (74 vs 63.5 years old, OR 1.06, p = 0.03).
32473600, Patients who combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin presented 3/18 deaths, regardless of age, staging, histology, cancer treatment and comorbidities (OR 0.02, p = 0.03).Cancer patients are vulnerable to Covid-19 with an increase in complications.
32473600, Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is presented as a good treatment option.
32473600, Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified.
32473600, Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients' with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology.
32473600, The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease.
32473600, The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.
32473600, Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus.
32473600, The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied.
32473600, These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations.
32473600, Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

32473600, In particular, influenza virus, coronavirus, and other respiratory viruses circulate in nature in various animal species and can cause severe and rapidly spread human infections.
32473600, Although scientific advancements have allowed for rapid progress to be made to understand the pathogenesis and develop therapeutics after each viral pandemic, few effective methods to treat virus-induced ALI have been described.
32473600, Recently, stem cell therapy has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases, including ALI.
32473600, In this review, we detail the present stem cell-based therapeutics for lung injury caused by influenza virus and the outlook for the future state of stem cell therapy to deal with emerging influenza and coronaviruses.
32473600, The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital.
32473600, One interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once half of the total number of events required has been observed.This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19.

32473600, Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers.This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy.
32473600, Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay.
32473600, Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery.
32473600, A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations.
32473600, The pharmacophore model and molecular docking study are used to explore the structural properties of the compounds and the ligand-receptor (PDB_ID: 6LU7) interactions respectively.
32473600, MM_GBSA study gives the binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex and ADME property analysis explains the pharmacological property of the compounds.
32473600, The resultant best molecule (CQD15) further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study which explains the protein stability (RMSD), ligand properties as well as protein-ligand contacts.
32473600, Outcomes of the present study conclude with the molecule CQD15 which shows better interactions for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine.
32473600, Additionally, we analyzed the intervention scheme of acupuncture for COVID-19 developed by China Association of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and supplemented the protocol of the intervention with auricular acupuncture.
32473600, It was proposed that the advantages of acupuncture and moxibustion should be fully displayed while Chinese herbal medications have been applied in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, During treatment, acupuncture physicians should be rationally allocated to a certain proportion so as to adequately utilize comprehensive therapeutic approaches and guarantee people's safety to the greatest extent.
32473600, Eventually, the clinical therapeutic effect may be improved, the national resources be economized on and the COVID-19 epidemic be conquered early.
32473600, The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications.
32473600, With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope.

32473600, It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32473600, Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32473600, Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
32473600, Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32473600, Significant difference was detected between the quality groups in terms of views per day (p = 0.004).
32473600, No significant difference was detected in comments per day (p = 0.139) and like ratio (p = 0.232).Besides high-quality videos, there were substantially low-quality videos that could cause misleading information to spread rapidly during the pandemic.
32473600, Videos from trustworthy sources such as universities, academics, and physicians should be kept in the foreground.Key Points•Web-based platforms have become an important source of health-related information.
32473600, One of the most important online sources is YouTube because it is easy accessible and free.•Of the videos evaluating the link between COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high quality.•The main sources of high-quality videos were academics/universities and physicians.•The most frequently discussed topics in videos were the place of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 and whether to continue the use of existing rheumatological drugs.
32473600, There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies.
32473600, Following the spike in public interest, the average number of new trials increased tenfold with respect to antimalarial therapies.The relatively small sample sizes and the number of independent trials investigating similar therapies are concerning.
32473600, Resources may not be being allocated based on scientific merit and may be driven by public consciousness and speculation.
32473600, Moving forward, a concerted effort focused on implementing large, well-coordinated and carefully designed multi-armed clinical trials will help to ensure that the most promising therapeutic options are rigorously studied and clinically meaningful results produced.
32473600, Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering.
32473600, This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration.
32473600, A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, In this review, the features of SARS-CoV-2 will be addressed, as well as the reasons why it poses a particular challenge to diabetic patients.
32473600, We will also highlight the recent treatment strategies being explored to control this pandemic.
32473600, Emerging evidence demonstrates that the correct management of diabetes in those patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance for the viral disease progression, therefore, the importance of blood glucose control will also be addressed.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes.
32473600, COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%).
32473600, Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality due to COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic.
32473600, In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.Copyright © 2020 IMSS.

32473600, The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74).
32473600, However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01).
32473600, Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin.
32473600, This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.
32473600, Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces.
32473600, Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the US and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis.
32473600, Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, The average length of stay (LOS) and the time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 10.57 and 6.39 days, respectively.
32473600, None of the factors was associated with LOS or time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance.The severity of COVID-19 in pediatric cases were milder than adults.

32473600, To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs.
32473600, The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others.The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario.As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes.
32473600, We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated COVID-19 disease are straining healthcare systems around the world with large numbers of patients becoming ill in a very short period of time, overwhelming healthcare systems in many countries.
32473600, Several drugs are being repurposed into clinical trials in COVID-19 patients, ranging from drugs already well established in other diseases, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ ritonavir, azithromycin and tocilizumab/sarilumab, to those such as remdesivir still in development for their initial indication (1).
32473600, The opportunities for clinical pharmacology to contribute to the development of new treatments have already been described by others in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2).This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group.
32473600, Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P<0.001).
32473600, The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04).
32473600, Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

32473600, Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission.
32473600, Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.
32473600, The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges.
32473600, However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.
32473600, Penile cancers should undergo penectomy, while clinically negative groins can be kept on surveillance.
32473600, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided and adjuvant therapy should be deferred.
32473600, We need to tailor our treatment strategies to the prevailing present conditions, so as to fight and defeat both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer.
32473600, Protection of health care workers, judicious use of available resources, and a rational and balanced outlook towards different malignancies is the need of the hour.
32473600, Each recommendation is earmarked as enduring if intended to outlast the pandemic, and limited if intended only during the duration of the pandemic.

32473600, Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate.
32473600, The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period.
32473600, Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay.In a one-month period (3/27/20-4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites.This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic.
32473600, The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.
32473600, Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery.
32473600, For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.
32473600, The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.
32473600, The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.

32473600, In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, p < 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group.
32473600, COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, p < 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, p < 0.001).
32473600, In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p = 0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p = 0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p = 0.009) on admission.COVID-19 patients admitted with neurologic disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.© 2020 American Academy of Neurology.
32473600, One nonrandomized study (n = 40) on convalescent plasma in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) provided uninformative results regarding mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 0.01 to 1.70).
32473600, Pooled estimates from 4 RCTs on influenza (n = 572) showed no convincing effects on deaths (4 RCTs, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.81), complete recovery (2 RCTs, odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.64) or length of stay (3 RCTs, mean difference -1.62, 95% CI -3.82 to 0.58, d).
32473600, The quality of evidence was very low for all efficacy outcomes.
32473600, Convalescent plasma caused few or no serious adverse events in influenza RCTs (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.29, low-quality evidence).Studies of non- COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections provide indirect, very low-quality evidence that raises the possibility that convalescent plasma has minimal or no benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 and low-quality evidence that it does not cause serious adverse events.Joule Inc. or its licensors.

32473600, In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model.
32473600, While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi.
32473600, Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection.
32473600, As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.Copyright © 2020 Park et al.
32473600, The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes.
32473600, In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs).
32473600, In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs.
32473600, Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.
32473600, Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts.
32473600, The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients.
32473600, Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean ± standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.1, 0.86 ± 0.16 and 0.80 ± 0.1 and a receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.79 ± 0.1.
32473600, The need for ICU treatment is independently associated with affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP, and IL-6.
32473600, While incineration, chemical disinfection, and physical disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastes disinfection.
32473600, In addition, considering the characteristics of various hospital wastes, the classification and selection of corresponding disinfection technologies are discussed.
32473600, On this basis, this study provides scientific suggestions for management, technology selection, and operation of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection in China, which is of great significance for development of national disinfection strategy for hospital wastes and wastewater during COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600,The pharmacological and immunological properties of interferons, especially those of interferon beta, and the corresponding treatment strategies are described, and the results of studies with different interferons in coronavirus infections are analysed.
32473600, Furthermore, the data obtained with high-dosed native interferon beta in life-threatening acute viral diseases as well as the results of clinical pilot studies with high-dosed recombinant interferon beta-1a are provided because they serve as the rationale for the proposed therapeutic regimen to be applied in acute viral infections.
32473600, This regimen differs from those approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and consists of interferon beta-1a administered as a 24 hour intravenous infusion at a daily dose of up to 90 µg for 3-5 consecutive days.
32473600, Since under this regimen transient severe side effects can occur, it is analysed which patients are suitable for this kind of treatment in general and if patients with severe coronavirus infections could also be treated accordingly.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD.
32473600, Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment.
32473600, Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%.Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring.
32473600, Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.
32473600, A non-systematic review of the medical literature was performed.
32473600, Information about their safety and efficacy as antimalarials, antivirals, as well as in the long-term treatment of rheumatic diseases was collected.
32473600, We found an anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of longterm cardiovascular events, a very infrequent heart disease due to a lysosomal effect of the drug, and at the hemodynamic level hypotension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation, exacerbated when combined with azithromycin.
32473600, However, the rate of adverse cardiac events of hydroxychloroquine (and chloroquine) was low.
32473600, In conclusion, given the high prevalence and fatality of cardiovascular disease, even a small negative impact on the efficacy of its care will translate into large numbers of people affected in Argentina.
32473600, It is necessary to inform the authorities and educate the public so cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors remain a health priority, as long as resources exist and minimizing the risk of contagion and spread of the virus.
32473600,The current Covid-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to global well-being and its mental health consequences are just becoming understood.
32473600, While the crisis has led to a temporary halt in a lot of ongoing or planned psychiatric research, this pandemic is a natural experiment that can help the field to repurpose research to better understand the causes, presentations and outcome trajectories as well as treatments in psychiatry.
32473600, Inter-disciplinary collaborations between researchers are needed to rapidly develop and share the emerging new knowledge of the mental health implications of Covid-19, This will help mount an effective response to the current as well as future pandemics.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.
32473600, The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6).
32473600, In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment.
32473600, Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development.
32473600, According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Although most cases are mild, a subset of patients develop a severe and atypical presentation of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised by a cytokine release storm (CRS).
32473600, Paradoxically, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS.
32473600, We hypothesize that the intrinsic circadian clock of the lung and the immune system may regulate individual components of CRS and thus chronotherapy may be used to effectively manage ARDS in COVID-19 patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3'UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms.
32473600, Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions.
32473600, Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene could similarly be modulated using SSOs to exclude critical domains required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Strategies can also be designed to deliver these SSOs directly to the lungs in order to minimize the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.© 2020 The Author(s).

32473600, Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat.
32473600, The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
32473600, There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
32473600, Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32473600, Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells.
32473600, These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) properties.

32473600, In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury.
32473600, In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange.
32473600, Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab).
32473600, In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.© 2020, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

32473600,In response to the rapid spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), healthcare systems should establish procedures for early recognition and management of suspected or confirmed cases.
32473600, We describe the various steps taken for the development, implementation, and dissemination of the interdisciplinary COVID-19 protocol at Jackson Health System (JHS), a complex tertiary academic health system in Miami, Florida.
32473600, Recognizing the dynamic nature of COVID-19, the protocol addresses the potential investigational treatment options and considerations for special populations.
32473600, The protocol also includes infection prevention and control measures and routine care for suspected or proven COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients.
32473600, Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience.
32473600, The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19.
32473600, We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.
32473600, The effect of many of the drugs used for treatment of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) on COVID-19 is not clear.
32473600, We also do not have data on the impact of this autoimmune disease, which may involve the mucous membranes, on the acquisition or course of COVID-19.
32473600, We are currently in the midst of a pandemic and evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on the population of susceptible patients suffering from auto-immune diseases like pemphigus is essential.
32473600, The evidence on best ways to manage patients with underlying conditions, such as pemphigus, during the outbreak of COVID-19 is evolving and the data is updated every day.
32473600, According to the included articles, two children had died, one of which was a 14-year-old boy and his exposure history and underlying disease were unclear, and the other was a male newborn with gestational age of 35 weeks and 5 days, birth weight of 2200, Apgar score of 8, 8 (1 min and 5 min) and his first symptom was increased heart rate.
32473600, No differences were found between male and female children regarding infection with COVID-19.Most pediatrics were infected with COVID-19 due to family cluster or history of close contact.
32473600, Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared to infected adults.
32473600, We should pay special attention to early diagnosis and early treatment in children infected with COVID-19.
32473600, As a result, all non-emergent surgeries have been suspended in order to provide hospital beds and other resources for COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Additionally, ambulatory efforts to avoid treatment-related morbidity are critical for keeping patients out of emergency departments and hospitals.
32473600, In this review article, we discuss evidence-based radiation therapy approaches for curable cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, We focus on three scenarios of cancer care: 1) radiation therapy as an alternative to surgery when immediate surgery is not possible, 2) radiation therapy as a 'bridge' to surgery, and 3) radiation options definitively or postoperatively, given the risk of hospitalization with high-dose chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020, Parashar et al.
32473600, Other causes of myoclonus were ruled-out, and none of them had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia.
32473600, All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy.Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a postinfectious/immune-mediated disorder.
32473600, However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb.

32473600, Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been practiced in many sepsis patients with AKI.
32473600, Still, the timing and dosing need further robust evidence.
32473600, In addition to the traditional CRRT, the high-throughput membrane with adsorption function and cytokine adsorption column are two representatives of recently emerging novel membrane technologies.
32473600, Their potential in removing inflammatory factors and other toxins prospects for the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32473600, On the other hand, oral iron is recommended in patients with mild anemia and inactive disease.
32473600, However, during the current coronavirus pandemic, hospital activities have significantly changed, and all non-essential procedures, including non-urgent iron infusions, have been rescheduled.
32473600, Oral iron, including both the traditional formulations with ferrous iron and the new ferric iron complexes, could constitute a valid alternative for anemia treatment.
32473600, For this reason, we conducted a literature review, to summarize the scientific evidence on oral iron therapy in IBD patients with anemia.
32473600, As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation.
32473600, Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy.
32473600, Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment.
32473600, The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.
32473600,The novel Coronavirus 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has surprised health authorities around the world, quickly producing a global health crisis.
32473600, Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
32473600, In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat.
32473600, In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications.
32473600, The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction.
32473600, In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors.
32473600, CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources.
32473600, Although the data come from a very small cohort, our protocol seems related to a low mortality.
32473600,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious threat to public health and local economies around the globe.
32473600, This has created an urgent need to identify effective medications for its prevention and treatment (1).
32473600, Among these treatments, the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic derivate of chloroquine, has become a common practice among clinicians, including pediatricians, despite lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy for this indication (especially for pediatric patients) at present time (2).This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Moreover, different OA treatments such as NSAIDs, paracetamol, corticosteroids, opioids or other molecules have a wide array of iatrogenic effects, potentially increasing COVID-19 secondary infection incidence or complications.
32473600, In this review we critically analyse the evidences on either negative or positive effect of drugs commonly used to manage OA in this particular scenario.
32473600, This would provide orthopaedic surgeons at first, and physicians, pharmacologists and clinicians at general, a comprehensive description about the safety of the current pharmacological approaches and a decision making tool to treat their OA patients as the coronavirus pandemic continues.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, The virus gains access to the respiratory epithelium through cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32473600, The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus is unlikely to mutate without loss of pathogenicity and thus represents an attractive target for antiviral treatment.
32473600, Inhaled modified recombinant human ACE2, may bind SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate lung damage.
32473600, This decoy strategy is unlikely to provoke an adverse immune response and may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups.
32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic requires us to rethink how virtual approaches might work for people who use alcohol and other drugs.
32473600, Are virtual clinics only suitable for clients with whom clinicians have already formed a therapeutic relationship? How well would virtual clinics work for new clients presenting to services, for clients in acute distress, and for those with complex problems? Addressing the sustained change required to maintain substance-free lives or a safe substance-use life requires robust psychotherapeutic approaches, which have traditionally been delivered through physical contact, whether they are one-to-one or group-based interventions.
32473600, The challenge during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic is to deliver effective talking therapies while avoiding physical contact.
32473600, How then should services continue to offer counselling and support in such an environment? How can we learn from the COVID-19 situation to deliver treatment to individuals who may have difficulties attending traditional clinic-based care, such as those in more rural areas with transport difficulties? This article focuses on identifying practical issues and providing some solutions.
32473600, The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues.
32473600, Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the second turn of RNA.
32473600, Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged 'sliding poles'. These sliding poles can account for the known processivity of the RdRp that is required for replicating the long coronavirus genome3.
32473600, Our results enable a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)4.
32473600, Indeed, while thyroid nodules are very common, only a small percentage are cancerous and, in turn, most thyroid cancers are indolent in nature.
32473600, Accordingly, diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules, thyroid surgery for either benign or malignant thyroid nodules and radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers may be safely postponed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32473600, Appropriate patient counselling, however, is mandatory and red flags should be carefully identified prompting immediate evaluation and treatment as appropriate.
32473600, For these selected cases diagnostic work-up (e.g. ultrasound, scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration), surgery and radioiodine therapy may proceed despite the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, after an individual risk-benefit analysis.
32473600, Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves' ophthalmopathy.
32473600, Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication.
32473600, The usual advice to increase dosage of levothyroxine during pregnancy should be adhered to.
32473600, Many newly presenting and previously diagnosed patients with thyroid dysfunction can be managed through virtual telephone or video clinics supported by a dedicated nurse-led service, depending on available facilities.
32473600, A total of 11 studies included accounting for 2084 COVID-19 patients.The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients with a mean age>50 years was 13.2%, whereas studies with relatively younger patients (mean age <50 years) had a pooled prevalence of 9.0% CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients was found to be 13.2% with studies including relatively elderly patients showing higher rates of diabetes.

32473600, The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%).
32473600, The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in severe patients (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P<.0001).
32473600, The median length of hospitalization was 17 (14-19) days, and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 (6-10) days.Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, and provide an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, This paper explores the risks of COVID-19 incurred while striving to uphold the standard of care in head and neck oncology.
32473600, The ethical problems are assessed from the perspective of the patient with cancer, health-care provider, and other patients within the health-care system.

32473600,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic is causing an increased need for mechanical ventilation for a significant percentage of people who present to the hospital for treatment.
32473600, This increase in demand could surpass the supply of ventilators and lead to an increase in mortality due to a lack of ventilator vacancies.
32473600, There is significant evidence that osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) can alleviate pulmonary symptoms and aid in quicker recoveries from various respiratory ailments.
32473600, OMM has the potential to play a significant role in helping reduce a patient's need for mechanical ventilation by delaying the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome stemming from SARS-Cov2 infections.
32473600, The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
32473600, The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT.
32473600, The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.
32473600, The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.
32473600,COVID-19 is an emerging disease of public health concern.
32473600, While there is no specific recommended treatment for COVID-19, nitric oxide has the potential to be of therapeutic value for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32473600, However, inhaled nitric oxide has not yet been formally evaluated.
32473600, Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the large numbers of hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support, clinical use of inhaled nitric oxide may become an alternate rescue therapy before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32473600, It may be happening to you now; it may be on the horizon in the coming weeks.
32473600, In this context, SAGES put together this document addressing concerns on clinician stressors in these times of uncertainty.
32473600, We chose to focus on the emotional toll of the situation on the clinician, protecting vulnerable persons, reckoning with social isolation, and promoting wellness during this crisis.
32473600, At the same time, the last part of this document deals with the "light at the end of the tunnel," discussing potential opportunities, lessons learned, and the positives that can come out of this crisis.
32473600, In addition, the tolerability of lithium as an antiviral agent should be addressed.
32473600, In fact, treatment with lithium requires continuous monitoring of its serum levels in order to prevent acute toxicity and long-term side effects, most notably affecting the kidney and thyroid.
32473600, Yet lithium reaches heterogeneous but bioequivalent concentrations in different tissues, and the anatomical compartment of the viral infection might underpin a different, lower need for tolerability concerns which need to be addressed.Lithium presents a clear antiviral activity demonstrated at preclinical level, but that remains to be confirmed in clinical settings.
32473600, In addition, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of lithium may provide an insight for its possible use as antiviral agent targeting specific pathways.
32473600, Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day).
32473600, The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation.
32473600, The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
32473600, These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.
32473600, The prevention of nosocomial spread is paramount to proper control of COVID-19 and is reviewed.
32473600, Currently, treatment is supportive.
32473600, Researchers are working to develop vaccines and identify effective antiviral interventions.
32473600, Those recently discussed in the literature are briefly reviewed.
32473600, In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes.
32473600, Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly.
32473600, On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies.
32473600, Hence, the opportunity of the COVID 19 crisis should be taken to make a significant step forward in the care for diabetes patients.
32473600, Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7.
32473600, ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys.
32473600, ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection.

32473600, A total of 8 patients received combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicines and western medicines.
32473600, From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method.
32473600, D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT(computed tomography) progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients, in our study, more 50% of patients had elevated levels of these indicators, but only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. 5 (56%) ordinary type patients had been discharged, while the 1 (11%) critical type patient died 3 days after admission.
32473600, Cancer comorbidity seems to have no direct relationship with severe events, and the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine may be effective in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NICP).© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600, We outline a model of hyperacute stroke evaluation in an adapted stroke code protocol and novel methods of stroke patient management.The overall goal of the model is to preserve patient access and outcomes while decreasing potential COVID-19 exposure to patients and healthcare providers.
32473600, This model also serves to reduce the use of vital PPE.
32473600, It is critical that stroke providers share best practices via academic and vetted social media platforms for rapid dissemination of tools and care models during the COVID-19 crisis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Both cases were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, They had obesity and a family history of hypertension.
32473600, Continuous blood pressure monitoring in the resting state during hospitalization showed that blood pressure was above the 95% reference interval of normal value for children of the same age, and the two boys were given calcium channel blockers or β-receptor blockers and were then recovered.
32473600, It is concluded that comprehensive management of children with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, should be taken seriously during the epidemic.
32473600, Wuchang PFTH is the first one to put into clinical practice and the last one suspended in Wuhan.
32473600, The National Emergency Medical Rescue Team of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, together with other 13 medical teams (841 medical staff in total), have fulfilled the task for the treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients, without any medical staff infected.
32473600, The first author of the article was the only pediatrician working in the Wuchang PFTH.
32473600, The author describes and summarizes the features/functions, management/operations, and advantages/challenges of the PFTH, in order to provide reference for medical institutions and relevant departments to deal with public health emergencies.
32473600, The benefits of the lockdown for service users is also discussed.
32473600, Many found the cessation of visits from family members with whom they had an ambivalent relationship.
32473600, The lockdown improved relationships between patients on the unit and encouraged a greater feeling of community.
32473600, The lockdown has also emphasised the importance of team self-awareness and an awareness of the nature of the treatments offered.
32473600, The covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the delivery of these services, such as undetected cases or long delays to treatment.
32473600, Furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic will likely increase the mental health needs of communities, including the incidence of psychotic disorders.
32473600, In this perspective piece, we provide suggestions as to how early intervention for psychosis services can adapt within this environment, such as utilizing novel technologies.
32473600, Finally, we argue that despite the economic consequences of the pandemic, the funding for mental health services, including early intervention services, should be increased in line with the need for these services during and beyond the pandemic.
32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the traditional practice of psychiatric assessment and treatment via face to face interaction.
32473600, Telepsychiatry, the delivery of psychiatric care remotely through telecommunications technology, is an existing and under-utilised tool that may help to minimise disruption to patient care.
32473600, Technological advancement is at a stage where it can facilitate widespread use of this practice; however concerns that limited its expansion previously were not unfounded.
32473600, This article discusses the use of telepsychiatry in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level.
32473600, Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans.
32473600, Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed.COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world.
32473600, Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32473600, Just as coronavirus itself the reports about the disease have massively spread through media and public contributing to overall public fear and stress.
32473600, This promotion of non-scientific evidence and misinformation through social media might have also a devastating impact on the individuals immune system.
32473600, Data regarding the mortality rates of COVID-19 have achieved unprecedented media and public engagements, however, the true facts about the disease prevention, immunomodulation and novel treatments are often left unsaid.
32473600, We present the most recent facts about COVID-19 disease and its interactions with the immune system.
32473600, Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found.
32473600, Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes.
32473600, The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities.
32473600, Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.
32473600, Hopefully, the efforts of clinical researchers in the fight against the SARS Cov-2 will result into the identification of effective treatments.
32473600, To make this possible, clinical research should be oriented by guidelines for more harmonized high-quality studies and by a united commitment of the scientific community to share personal knowledge and data.
32473600, Allergists and clinical immunologists should have a leading role in this unprecedent challenge.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes.
32473600, Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression.
32473600, High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count.
32473600, The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes.
32473600, In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining life-saving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32473600, The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screened for COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, He had been trying to connect to a community buprenorphine/naloxone provider, but access was limited due to COVID-19, so he was using diverted buprenorphine/naloxone to reduce opioid use.
32473600, He was restarted on his previous dose of 12/3 mg daily which was continued via phone follow-up 16 days later.COVID-19-related regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation via telemedicine.
32473600, We describe 2 cases where telemedicine was combined with street outreach to connect patients experiencing homelessness with OUD to treatment.
32473600, These cases highlight an important opportunity to provide access to life-saving OUD treatment for vulnerable patients in the setting of a pandemic that mandates reduced face-to-face clinical interactions.
32473600,: The United States is currently in the midst of 2 public health emergencies: COVID-19 and the ongoing opioid crisis.
32473600, In an attempt to reduce preventable harm to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), federal, state, and local governments have temporarily modified law and policy to increase access to OUD treatment and divert some individuals at high risk away from the correctional system.
32473600, In this Commentary, we briefly describe how people with OUD are at increased risk for COVID-19, discuss existing policy barriers to evidence-based prevention and treatment for individuals with OUD, explain the temporary rollbacks of those barriers, and argue that these changes should be made permanent.
32473600, We also suggest several additional steps that federal and state governments can urgently take to reduce barriers to care for individuals with OUD, both during the current crisis and beyond.
32473600, As the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic proceeds, many efforts are being dedicated to the development of diverse treatment strategies.
32473600, Increasing evidence showed potential therapeutic agents directly acting against SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as interferon, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, viral entry blockers, neuraminidase inhibitor, vaccine, antibody agent targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, natural killer cells and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking inhibitor.
32473600, To date, several direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have demonstrated promising in vitro and clinical efficacy.
32473600, This article reviews the current and future development of direct acting agents against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients.
32473600, In addition to the high risk of cluster infection and compromised immunity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), an atypical disease presentation could also make the medial system neglect these patients during CVOID-19 pandemic.
32473600, To avoid COVID-19 transmission among dialysis patients, the major societies of nephrology around the world have provided their guidelines of screening, dialysis facilities adjustment, and health education, respectively.
32473600, In this review, we summarized the main contents and difference of these guidelines and addressed the prompt management for ESRD patients to reduce the risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, The pathophysiology of COVID-19 critical illness is being revealed on a day to day basis at the frontlines of care in the intensive care unit with this new disease.
32473600, High density consolidations in the bronchial tree and in the pulmonary parenchyma have been described in the advanced phase of the disease.
32473600, Our team has observed impeded ventilation in intubated patients who are several days into the critical course due to what seems to be tissue sloughing with resultant endotracheal tube obstruction and the consequences thereof.
32473600, Caregivers need to be aware of this pathological finding, recognize, and to treat this aspect of the COVID-19 critical illness course, which is becoming more prevalent.
32473600, The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care.
32473600, The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics.
32473600, Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount.
32473600, Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.
32473600, This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity.
32473600, Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
32473600, The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
32473600, Furthermore, solutions for enhancing international strategies in translational research, cooperative networks and regulatory partnerships are contemplated.
32473600, We urgently need to find treatment and vaccine to stop the epidemic.
32473600, Vaccine development is in progress, but any approved and effective vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 12 to 18 months.
32473600, The World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have issued instructions and strategies for containing COVID-19 outbreak to the general public, physicians, travelers and injured patients to follow so that the transmission to a healthy population can be prevented.
32473600, In this review, we summarize demographic data, clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes and finally prevention and control of this serious pandemic.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
32473600, The median stroke onset-to-door time was ≈1-hour longer in COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 (154 versus 95 minutes, P=0.12), and the proportion of individuals with onset-to-door time within 4.5 hours was significantly lower (55% versus 72%, P=0.024).
32473600, Significantly fewer cases of transient ischemic attack presented to the hospital during COVID-19 (4% versus 16%, P=0.016), despite no increase in referrals to the transient ischemic attack clinic.
32473600, Inpatient stroke pathways and treatment time metrics nevertheless did not differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05 for all comparisons).During the early containment phase of COVID-19, we noted a prolongation in stroke onset to hospital arrival time and a significant reduction in individuals arriving at the hospital within 4.5 hours and presenting with transient ischemic attack.
32473600, Public education about stroke should continue to be reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols.
32473600, One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them.
32473600, It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation.
32473600, We therefore strongly encourage other hospitals to adopt simulation training to prepare their medical teams for code strokes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, These mechanisms are interconnected and have profound therapeutic implications involving extracorporeal removal of inflammatory cytokines.
32473600, Dialysis patients, and children, in particular, should be classified as "at high risk" of contracting the disease.
32473600, Infections are one of the most frequent causes of death in children with chronic renal failure who undergo dialysis.
32473600, The reasons for this particular susceptibility are to be found in the compromised immune system, secondary to chronic malnutrition, immunosuppressive therapy, and uremia, frequent contact with healthcare personnel and other patients attending the dialysis unit and in need of the presence of other family members during treatment.
32473600, CONCLUSION: At the current level of disease in the United States, all three models have sustained major system stress in continuing reduced operation.
32473600, However, the small clinic model may not perform if either the current level of infections is maintained for long or staff becomes unavailable due to health issues.

32473600, Conclusion: In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.Copyright © 2020 Lu, Gong, Peng, Zeng and Liu.
32473600, However, when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning are unsuccessful, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) may be used.  We present a case of a 41-year-old female, with no significant medical history and no recent history of exposure to sick contacts, presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, severe shortness of breath, and flu-like symptoms with a positive COVID-19 test.
32473600, Ultimately, she worsened on mechanical ventilation and prone positioning and required VV-ECMO.
32473600, The use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 infected patients is still controversial.
32473600, While some studies have shown a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment, such as in our case, the lack of large sample size studies and treatment alternatives places healthcare providers against a wall without options in patients with severe refractory ARDS due to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Douedi et al.
32473600, Public health policies aimed at preventing new COVID-19 cases were very effective in halting the pandemic in Thailand.
32473600, Case fatality in Thailand has been low (1.7%), at least in part due to early stratification according to risk of disease severity and timely initiation of supportive care with affordable measures.
32473600, We present our initial experience with COVID-19 in Thailand, focusing on several aspects that may have played a crucial role in curtailment of the pandemic, and elements of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients, including stratification, isolation, and affordable diagnostic approaches and supportive care measures.
32473600, We also discuss local considerations concerning some proposed experimental treatments.
32473600, The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world.
32473600, The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths.
32473600, Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority.
32473600, However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.
32473600, This review provides a basis for further research and development of clinical applications of curcumin for the treatment of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.

32473600, Another confounding factor is cigarette smoking, which has been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in both experimental models and humans.
32473600, Sex also plays a role, with chromosome X harbouring the gene coding for ACE-2, which is one of the possible explanations of why mortality in female patients is lower. Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, an androgen dependent enzyme.
32473600, Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies. We claim the need of adequately powered, prospective studies aimed at answering the following questions of paramount importance for cardiovascular, internal and emergency medicine: Do ACE-Is and ARBs exert similar or different effects on infection or disease course? Are such effects dangerous, neutral or even useful in older, COVID-19-affected patients? Do they act on multiple cell types? Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.
32473600, At present, insufficient detailed data from trials have been made available.
32473600, In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these drugs against COVID-19.
32473600, Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them.
32473600, COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations.
32473600, Moreover, herein, we describe current evidence that may be changed in the future.
32473600, At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (P < 0.001).
32473600, Despite that all patients were on standard treatment for Covid-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization.
32473600, In a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, both patients with hyperglycemia and patients with diabetes had a higher risk of severe disease than those without diabetes and with normoglycemia.
32473600, Cox regression analysis evidenced that patients with hyperglycemia treated with insulin infusion had a lower risk of severe disease than patients without insulin infusion.Insulin infusion may be an effective method for achieving glycemic targets and improving outcomes in patients with Covid-19.© 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.
32473600, For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7 d.p.o), Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001).
32473600, The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% 2 weeks later, respectively.
32473600, When the same antibody type was detected, no significant difference was observed between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other forms of immunoassays.A typical acute antibody response is induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, Serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of illness for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patients.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32473600, The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days).
32473600, Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
32473600, Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days versus 28.5 days, Log-rank p<0.001).Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19.
32473600, Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32473600, Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease.
32473600, Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients.
32473600, The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology.
32473600, Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations.
32473600, Our deliberations and treatment recommendations are summarized here.Objective:To provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
32473600, Most of the treatments found were protease inhibitors aimed at proteases such as PLpro, 3CLpro, RNA helicase, and Spike protein, or used monoclonal antibodies and interferons.
32473600, In addition, the use of Chinese folk medicine and its multitude of medicinal plants with strong antiviral properties was reinforced.
32473600, Thus, these therapies used in previous epidemics can serve as an aid in the new pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 and be a starting point for new treatments.Expert opinion: The various antiviral alternatives presented in this review offer therapeutic options to fight coronavirus infections.
32473600, If shown to be effective, these drugs may be extremely important in the current pandemic.
32473600, The study revealed that remdesivir exhibited an EC50 value of 0.07 µM against HCoV-229E with TC50 of > 2.00 µM against MRC-5 cells.
32473600, Parent NRTIs were found to be inactive against (HCoV-229E) at tested concentrations.
32473600, Among all the NRTIs and 5'-O-fatty acyl conjugates of NRTIs, 5'-O-tetradecanoyl ester conjugate of FTC showed modest activity with EC50 and TC50 values of 72.8 µM and 87.5 µM, respectively.
32473600, These data can be used for the design of potential compounds against other coronaviruses.
32473600, Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store.
32473600, The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis.
32473600, Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.
32473600, In this review, we discuss the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection as well as the possibility of targeting lipid metabolism to interfere with the viral life cycle.
32473600, This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
32473600, With ongoing treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients other questions will come up.
32473600, While respective guidelines on these topics will serve clinicians in clinical practice, regularly updating all guidelines concerning COVID-19 will be a necessary, although challenging task in the upcoming weeks and months.
32473600, All recommendations during the current extremely rapid development of knowledge must be evaluated on a daily basis, as suggestions made today may be out-dated with the new evidence available tomorrow.
32473600, Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity.
32473600, ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response.
32473600, PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro.
32473600, In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.

32473600, By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols are produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management.
32473600, Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa.
32473600, This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID-19, in the post-pandemic era.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, This has included doubling or trebling intensive care (ICU) capacity within hospitals, augmenting this with Nightingale Hospitals, cancelling all non-emergency surgery and redeploying staff and equipment to focus on a single disease.
32473600, At the same time, government and population efforts have - through social distancing then lockdown- successfully flattened the epidemic curve and so reduced demand.
32473600, Together, these actions have enabled treatment of all those needing hospital care for COVID-19 and avoided the unfettered increase in mortality that would have accompanied an overwhelmed healthcare service.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, These patients each required significant oxygen supplementation trending toward intubation.
32473600, After tPA therapy, all patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in PaO2 values overtime.
32473600, Three of these patients avoided intubation due to COVID-19 associated respiratory failure.Administration of thrombolytics was followed by overall improvement in patients' oxygen requirements, and in three cases, prevented progression to mechanical ventilation, without deleterious effects.
32473600, Clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy would further serve to underscore the efficacy and utility of this therapy.Level V- Case series of therapeutic effect.
32473600, Training has been postponed as staff are reallocated to areas of need.
32473600, Face-to-face contact is largely minimized and innovative, virtual communication methods are used in the outpatient setting and multidisciplinary team meetings.
32473600, Surgical practice is changing because of the risks posed by COVID-19 and procedures can be prioritized in a nonurgent, low priority, high priority or emergency category.Although the COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably affect urological services, steps can be taken to mitigate the impact and prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care.
32473600, Similarly, in future; simulation, e-learning and webinars will allow interaction to share, discuss and debate focused training and education.
32473600, Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782).
32473600, For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020.
32473600, Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, Severe CO2 retention and acidosis prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indicated a poor prognosis.
32473600, The common thread linking these patients is lymphopenia, which largely reflects a decline in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells but not B cells.
32473600, These findings are consistent with data that lymphocyte TL dynamics impose a limit on T-cell proliferation.

32473600, We reviewed the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of COVID-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in previous clinical trials with positive outcomes.
32473600, We believe that targeting the central pathway (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), balancing the Th1 and Th2 response, and administering long-term anti-inflammatory therapy might be promising prospects to reduce cardiovascular impairment and even MODS during the acute and recovery phases of COVID-19.
32473600, The cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies might be of great application value to the management of COVID-19 patients and we further propose an algorithm for the selection of anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular impairment.
32473600, We recommend to take the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy as references in the management of COVID-19 and conduct related clinical trials, while the clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or in vitro drug screening should proceed with caution due to unguaranteed efficacy and safety profiles.Copyright © 2020 Wang, Zhang and Zhang.
32473600, One important strategy is implementation of oral cancer therapies.
32473600, Many standard regimens require intravenous infusions but there are specific circumstances where an oral agent could be an acceptable alternative.
32473600, Integrating oral therapeutics can permit patients to receive effective systemic treatment without the exposure risks associated with frequent infusions.

32473600,Remdesivir is a novel therapeutic with known activity against SARS CoV-2 and related coronaviruses.
32473600, Remdesivir, as well as convalescent plasma therapy, are currently under investigation as potential therapies for patients with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19).
32473600, In this case report we summarize the use of convalescent plasma therapy and then remdesivir as a late addition in the treatment of a critically ill obstetric patient with COVID-19.

32473600, Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage.
32473600, These included 1) Medical Emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; 2) Urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis ; 3) Semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic CVD, and 4) Discretionary/Non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema.
32473600, VELTAS aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency.

32473600, However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis.
32473600, Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19.: Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia.
32473600, He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms.: This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, It is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with "exposure risk" to COVID-19 for patients coming to clinic or the hospital.
32473600, If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation.
32473600, However, the COVID-19 outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work-up including potential exposure to COVID-19 versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high-risk, high likelihood World Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.

32473600, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan dysfunction and thrombotic events are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32473600, The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a "cytokine storm", also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19.
32473600, In addition to anti-viral therapy and supportive treatment in critically ill patients, unique medications for this condition are also under investigation.

32473600, However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others.
32473600, There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic.

32473600, In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels.
32473600, Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment.
32473600, Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32473600, Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.
32473600, Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications.
32473600, The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI.

32473600, With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities.
32473600, Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children.
32473600, This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region.

32473600, The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
32473600, According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22nd March (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).
32473600, However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available.
32473600, Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.© 2020 The Author(s).
32473600, In this retrospective cohort study, we included 354 inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 4, 2020 to February 28, 2020.
32473600, We found levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, white blood cell count and neutrophil count were clearly elevated in males and critical cases compared with females and severe and mild cases, respectively.
32473600, However, lymphopenia was more severe in males than females and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha were reduced significantly in critical cases than severe and mild cases. 23.5% of severe cases and 24.4% of critical cases were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens.
32473600, Additionally, stepwise multivariable regression analysis suggested that co-infection, lymphocyte count and levels of D-dimer were associated with severity of COVID-19.These findings provide crucial clues for further identification of the mechanisms, characteristics and treatments of patients with COVID-19.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Institut Pasteur.

32473600, Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups.Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) patients had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase.
32473600, Out of 59 patients, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B).
32473600, Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4 vs. 33.8 years), with longer LOS (19.1 vs. 15.0 days), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7 vs. 18.1 mg/L), and higher maximal CT score (5.2 vs. 4.0) than those in group B.Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge.

32473600, There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies.
32473600, Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added.Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable.
32473600, However, men are about 60% more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women.The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data.Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities.Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities.

32473600, Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation followed by maximal CRP.
32473600, Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83.
32473600, The calculated optimal cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6> 80 pg/ml and CRP> 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure.Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation.

32473600, Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed.
32473600, A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed.In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% versus 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-2.59, P = 0.818) and OS (95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, P = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group.
32473600, Three studies were examined for meta-analysis (median, n = 217), and a pooled HR for surgery wait-time of ≥8 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59-1.55).Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.
32473600, The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.

32473600,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019, a new illness with no effective treatment or vaccine that has reached pandemic proportions.
32473600, In this document, we analyze how health authorities and agencies around the world position themselves regarding the off-label use of repurposed drugs or new investigational drugs to treat Coronavirus Disease 2019.
32473600, We review the most promising candidate medicines, including available evidence, clinical recommendations and current options for access.
32473600, Our concluding remarks stress the importance of administering off-label and investigational drugs in the setting of clinical trials, or at least in standardized scenarios, to generate as much scientific knowledge as achievable while engaging in the best efforts to treat patients and save lives.
32473600, We developed the trial in response to local pressures for widespread, indiscriminate off-label use of these medications.
32473600, We employ a hybrid Bayesian-frequentist design for interim monitoring to allow rapid, contextual assessment of the available evidence.
32473600, We also developed an inference grid for the interpretation of the range of possible results from this trial within the context of parallel trials and prepared for network meta-analysis of the resulting data.
32473600, This trial was prospectively registered (NCT04329832) before enrollment of the first patient.
32473600, From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute.
32473600, Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses.
32473600, In accordance with the national standard "Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016)," we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Based on the experience we attained from the 12 severe COVID-19 cases in our hospital who underwent endoscopy 23 times in total, the article provides an improved version of endoscopic reprocessing guidelines for bedside endoscopic diagnosis and treatment on COVID-19 patients for reference.
32473600, The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P<0.001).
32473600, The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015).
32473600, More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group.
32473600, There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups.From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history.

32473600, Although over 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic or manifest noncritical symptoms and will recover from the infection, those individuals presenting with critical symptoms are in urgent need of effective treatment options.
32473600, Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics.
32473600, A critical literature review suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses, which in turn inhibits the development of protective immunity to the infection.
32473600, Therefore, the use of therapeutics that modulate inflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response could be the most effective therapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

32473600, The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe.
32473600, There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments.
32473600, Cellular based therapies hold great promise for the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, This literature summary reviews the scientific rationale and need for clinical studies of adipose-derived stem cells and other types of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients who suffer with COVID-19.
32473600, Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.
32473600, In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding.
32473600, We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.
32473600, It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.
32473600,Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery underwent drastic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Since March 10, the first day of the lockdown in Italy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergency and oncology cases, while outpatient procedures and clinical examinations were temporarily suspended to limit virus diffusion and to reallocate personnel into wards dedicated to COVID-19.
32473600, In our otolaryngology unit, between March 10 and April 28, 2020, we performed 96 surgical procedures; they mainly consisted in diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors of the head and neck (77%), management of acute upper airway obstruction in adults and children (14.7%), drainage of abscesses of the head and neck (6.2%), and treatment of nasal bone fractures (2.1%).
32473600, When comparing these data with those of the same period in 2019 for emergency and oncology procedures, we noticed a drastic reduction of head and neck abscesses and nasal bone fractures, while oncology surgery remained stable.
32473600,Contemporary medical practice is grounded in rigorous scientific evidence in concert with best clinical practices and informed shared decision making with patients.
32473600, During these times of uncertainty, disruption, and even anxiety, it becomes critical that we engage with our patients and communities in thoughtful dialogue and realistic expectations regarding treatments surrounding COVID-19.
32473600, The hope for a "miracle" cure and urgency to return back to normal times can stimulate irrational thought and behavior and even desperate measures by individuals or groups.
32473600, It becomes especially important that we continue to use reasonable, informed clinical judgment in discussing the various options with patients.
32473600, Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment.
32473600, Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death.
32473600, In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
32473600, There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions.This review highlighted the ways in which coronaviruses affect cardiovascular function and interacts with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.
32473600, Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time.
32473600, This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics.
32473600, To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time.
32473600, Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.
32473600, Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.
32473600, Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17).
32473600, Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death.
32473600, Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, Accumulating clinical observations raised hypotheses to explain why some patients develop more severe disease while others only manifest mild or no symptoms.
32473600, So far, Covid-19 management remains mainly supportive.
32473600, However, many researches are underway to clarify the role of antiviral and immunomodulating drugs in changing morbidity and mortality in patients who become severely ill.
32473600, This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system and discusses recent findings on proposed pharmacologic treatments.
32473600, Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies.
32473600, This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32473600, All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.
32473600, The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection.
32473600, Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary.
32473600, Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32473600, Among 84 patients who were initially classified as "outpatients", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days.
32473600, Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19.

32473600, Here we present two cases in which early manifestations of anosmia and hypogeusia were experienced with psycho-sensorial and atmospheric phenomena.
32473600, Psychiatrists, neurologists and physicians in general should be aware of this symptom presentation in order to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction might increase the risks of nutritional deficit and lead to development of adjustment disorders.
32473600, All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Vitamin D and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim, taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against COVID-19 infection, possibly even through a synergistic interaction.
32473600, The renin-angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 infection; and it may be down-regulated by vitamin D and melatonin in many organs.

32473600,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance.Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality.Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence.Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence).
32473600, Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence).
32473600, Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19.Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables.High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.
32473600, Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain.None. (PROSPERO: registration number pending).
32473600, The performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.
32473600, Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well.
32473600, Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection.
32473600, Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.Copyright: © 2020 Veljkovic V et al.

32473600, Other tweets discussed general Knowledge and information (9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the healthcare systems and workers (9%).
32473600, The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (8%), immunity (7%), testing (6%), and virus infection and transmission (5%).Findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms could help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during the pandemic outbreak.
32473600, In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing.
32473600, We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers.
32473600, Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19.
32473600, Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Through this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Conclusions: The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32473600, Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score ≥ 4 after admission.
32473600, Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in the hospitalized patients.
32473600, Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity.
32473600, Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population.
32473600, Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year.
32473600, Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.
32473600, The genome is arranged as 5p-replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins [Spike (S) -Envelope (E) - Membrane (M) -Nucleocapsid (N)] -3.
32473600, Viruses are obligate intracellular infectious agents that use the host cellular machinery to ensure their own fitness and survival.
32473600, MicroRNAs (miRNA9) systems are potent post-transcriptional gene expression regulators that are important modulators of viral infections, and could play an important role in the treatment of viral infections.
32473600, This review focuses to the genomic structure of coronaviruses, the functions of genomic proteins, the effects of micro RNA (miRNA) on virus replication and its pathogenesis.
32473600, As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease.
32473600, Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection.
32473600, We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function.
32473600, This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.
32473600, Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented.
32473600, Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease.
32473600, This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes.
32473600, Ongoing clinical trials are also emphasized.
32473600,The global context we are experiencing, characterized by the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, imposes strict containment, isolation and physical distance measures, necessary to control and contain the risk of contagion.
32473600, Despite social distances and isolation in this context of threat to Global Health, the sharing of experiences, professionalism, scientific research and Public Health strategies is fundamental.
32473600, Never before has telemedicine played a decisive role in supporting the healthcare organization, The University Hospital Consortium Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental partnership project with West China Hospital of Sichuan University through periodic and scheduled video conferences.The Company Strategic Management, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bari, Medical Executives of the Health Department, of the U.O of Infectious Diseases, Anesthesia and Resuscitation, Pulmonology, Emergency, Hygiene, Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Doctors Resident operating in the COVID Area. are involved in the Experimental Project., all adequately trained and instructed on the operating protocol.From the preliminary data of this study, it appears that the Bari Polyclinic has adopted the same therapeutic strategies started in China in the previous months, believing early diagnosis and treatment to be a strength in the battle against COVID-19.
32473600, The project makes it possible to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, using the experience acquired in the field by Chinese doctors who, first caught by this health emergency, have obtained positive results.
32473600, Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
32473600, These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention.
32473600, In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern.
32473600, Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.
32473600, At follow-up on 26 March, she felt well, throat swab RT-PCR was negative, and isolation was lifted.Conclusion: The urine of asymptomatic patients may be contagious.
32473600, RT-PCR in urine might be a useful supplement in screening when the RT-PCR is negative in throat swabs.
32473600, The duration of fever in the NHM group (3.4±2.4 days) was significantly shorter than that in the control group (5.6±2.2 days) (p=0.03).
32473600, During the whole hospitalization period, the number of cases with diarrhea in the NHM group (two cases) was less than that in the control group (eight cases) (p=0.03).
32473600, Compared with the control group (7.5±1.6), the duration for improvement (DI) of chest CT in the NHM group (5.6±2.3) was significantly shorter (p=0.04).
32473600, Our results suggest that NHM could improve the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients and may be effective in treating COVID-19; thus, a larger, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial should be conducted to further evaluate the adjuvant efficacy of NHM in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Twenty seven (15.4%) patients required intensive care unit admission.
32473600, Overall mortality was 26.3% (n = 46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106; 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63; 12.69%; P <0.001).
32473600, Seventeen out of 29 patients admitted to the intensive care unit died (mortality, 58.6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.2% mortality rate).Polish patients with COVID‑19 have similar characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcomes to those observed in countries in which outbreaks occurred earlier.
32473600, Significantly higher mortality in patients transferred from other centers warrants special attention and transfer policy should be verified.
32473600, Therefore, frequent monitoring is warranted in at-risk patients.
32473600, However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach for monitoring, treatment and referral decisions.
32473600, This is particularly the case in patients with advanced age.
32473600, In this article, through the use of case examples, we aim to provide guidance when facing difficult management decisions in patients with (suspected) COVID-19.
32473600,The 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic challenges the delivery of care for patients with head and neck cancer.
32473600, An important aspect of this care has been the evolution of enhanced survivorship services, which include surveillance for recurring cancer and prevention of second primaries.
32473600, The application of evidence-based approaches to the identification and management of treatment and tumor-related toxicities has embraced the use of validated patient-reported outcomes instruments, health promotion, and care coordination.
32473600, In this manuscript, we describe how our multidisciplinary team of survivorship providers has accommodated to the need to provide patients with social distancing while acknowledging the importance of continued care during treatment and through the spectrum of survivorship.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600,A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out at 2019 and had caused a pandemic around the world.
32473600, This disease was found resulting from the infection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (Zhu, et al 2020).
32473600, The severity of COVID-19 disease has a wide range and varies from asymptomatic to critical severe, clinical researches reported that 10-15% of the patients were in the severe situation and required a great deal of attention of treatment and nursing (WHO-China-Joint-Mission 2020).This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, During the pandemic, insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infected and contagious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient be ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection.
32473600, According to the scientific data available, the examinations and procedures potentially exposing to projections / aerosolizations of organic material of human origin are considered to be at risk of staff contamination.
32473600, For ENT examinations and procedures without exposure to such projections / aerosolizations, the professional is advised to a long sleeve clean outfit, a surgical mask and gloves in case of contact with the patient's mucosa.
32473600, ENT examinations and procedures with exposure to these projections / aerosolizations require the so-called "airborne", "contact", and "droplets" additional precautions: FFP2/N95 respiratory protection device, eye protection, disposable headwear and long sleeve overgown.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.
32473600, The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry.There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions.
32473600, Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic.
32473600, COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized.
32473600, Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.© The Author(s) 2020.
32473600,The new human coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus for which no specific drugs are currently available.
32473600, A knowledge-based analysis strongly suggests a possible repositioning of the anti-HCV direct antiviral agent (DAA) Sofosbuvir as treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Indeed, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (RdRp) of the two viruses show high sequence and structural homology, supporting the likelihood of binding the Sofosbuvir molecule with similar efficiency.
32473600, Such a repositioning would allow the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and limit the progression of disease to potentially deadly COVID19.© The Author(s) 2020.
32473600, Thus, timely treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is extremely important.

32473600, We review available data on commonly used immunosuppressants and their effect on viral infections beyond COVID-19.
32473600, Notably, the effect of some immunosuppressants on viruses related to SARS-CoV2, including SARS and MERS, has been previously investigated.
32473600, In the absence of data on the effect of immunosuppressants on COVID-19, these data could be used to make clinical decisions on initiation and continuation of immunosuppressive medications during this pandemic.
32473600, In summary, we recommend considering the discontinuation of oral JAK inhibitors and prednisone, considering the delay of rituximab infusion, and the careful continuation of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, and biologics in patients currently benefitting from such treatments.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32473600, The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high.
32473600, The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection.
32473600, Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19.
32473600, The Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU) and the Spanish Nurses Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (GETEII) have prepared this document as a practical response to some common questions about the treatment of these patients.© 2020 Published by Elsevier España, S.L.U.
32473600, Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific.
32473600, Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32473600, Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters.
32473600, Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.
32473600, The in vitro database, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
32473600, To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy.Expert opinion: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome.
32473600, In future, clinical trials regarding a combination of potentially effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be conducted to establish the optimal regimen for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
32473600, Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population.
32473600, The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection.
32473600, The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols.Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, In future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, efforts should be focused toward the provision of continued ED treatment with the implementation of revised triage and surveillance protocols.© 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.
32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest infectious challenges in recent history.
32473600, Presently, few treatment options exist and the availability of effective vaccines is at least one year away.
32473600, There is an urgent need to find currently available, effective therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection.

32473600, Louisiana is ranked within the bottom five states for cardiovascular health, and is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally.
32473600, Here, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city holding a sobering yet, resilient history with previous public health disasters.
32473600, In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to healthcare, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities.
32473600, Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.
32473600, Due to its highly contagious nature and unprecedented global spread, its aggressive clinical presentation and the lack of effective treatment, SARS-CoV-2 infection is causing the losses of thousands of lives and imparting unparalleled strains on healthcare systems around the world.
32473600, In the current report, we discuss perioperative considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and provide clinicians with recommendations to effectively triage and plan these procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, This will help reduce the risk of exposure to patients and healthcare workers and allocate resources appropriately to those in greatest need.
32473600, We include an algorithm for preoperative testing for COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations, and a classification system to categorize and prioritize common cardiac surgery procedures.
32473600, Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C).
32473600, Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.
32473600, Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon.
32473600, However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, In most cases, no major corrections were necessary.
32473600, However, in several cases significant revisions in the functionally sensitive area of protein-inhibitor complexes or for bound ions justified correction, re-refinement, and eventually re-versioning in the PDB.

32473600, Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures.
32473600, Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
32473600, It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Lymphocyte count increased in all patients soon after remdesivir initiation.
32473600, Nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA became negative in three of four patients after 3 days of therapy.
32473600, We observed an in vivo virological effect of remdesivir in four critically ill, COVID-19 patients, coupled with a significant burden of adverse events.
32473600, Although limited by the low number of subjects studied, our preliminary experience may be relevant for clinicians treating COVID-19.
32473600, The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P<0.05).
32473600, The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL-1 at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL-1 (P<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group.
32473600, These data demonstrate that addition of HCQ on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm.

32473600, All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion.Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period.
32473600, Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission.COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course.
32473600, Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications.
32473600, These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.
32473600, Treatment of the infected requires decisions in resource constraint situation particularly ICU beds and ventilators.
32473600, In the meantime, protecting doctors, nurses, other health workers as well as frontline workers need personal protective equipment which is a scarce commodity.

32473600, Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America.
32473600, This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected.
32473600, We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model.

32473600, Conservation of resources, social distancing, and the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19-positive cancer patients have forced practitioners and surgeons to completely rethink routine care.
32473600, The treatment of patients with rectal cancer requires both a multidisciplinary approach and a significant amount of resources.
32473600, It is therefore imperative to rethink how rectal cancer treatment can be aligned with the current COVID-19 pandemic paradigms.
32473600, In this review, we discuss evidence-based recommendations to optimize oncological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective.
32473600, In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers.
32473600, NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.
32473600, The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).
32473600, Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers.
32473600, The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation.From 1st February 2020 to 31 March 2020, we reported an increase in the number of first medical examinations and treatments, compared to the same period of the previous year.
32473600, Outpatients first medical examinations have been spread over the 12 working hours.
32473600, No COVID-19 cases were detected.During COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced procedures that allowed us to ensure the continuity in oncological cares, with limited risks of infection for patients and staff.
32473600, Acute G1 or G2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurred in 43% and acute G1-G2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in 14%. Late G1 and G3 GU toxicity in 18% and 3.5%, respectively.
32473600, The G3 toxicity was not directly attributable to radiotherapy.
32473600, Late G1 GI toxicity occurred in 18%. 5yy bRFS was 96.5% (95% CI 82.3-99.4%).Stereotactic body radiotherapy for early prostate cancer reported safe toxicity profile and a good clinical outcome at the median follow-up of 5 years.
32473600, It may be an useful option if radiotherapy is required in emergency medical conditions.
32473600, The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature.Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources.
32473600, Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic.
32473600, To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity.Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.
32473600, This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.
32473600, Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients.
32473600, Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves.There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management.

32473600,A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans.
32473600, China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease.
32473600, However, a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking.
32473600, To regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak, we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in Wuhan.The article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19, indications for emergency surgery, and infection prevention and control for medical personnel, providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period.The measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of COVID-19.
32473600, Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics.
32473600, Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak.
32473600, China provides solutions by adopting nationwide "pairing assistance" measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area.
32473600, By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing "pairing assistance" is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.

32473600, Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective.
32473600, Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time.
32473600, Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action.First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.
32473600, The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.
32473600, Overall, 446 different patients' WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities.
32473600, Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer.
32473600, Actions taken by oncologists are also reported.To our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results.
32473600, In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.

32473600, Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy.
32473600, Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.
32473600, Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.© 2020 The Author(s).
32473600, All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury and hepatobiliary dysfunction.
32473600, At the end-of-treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function and lower HScore.
32473600, Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis.
32473600, These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore and support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging.
32473600, Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.

32473600, Care for patients with cancer is particularly important given increased infection rates and worse outcomes from COVID-19 in this patient population, as well as potential adverse outcomes if treatment pathways need to be compromised.
32473600, In this commentary, we provide a global oncology pharmacy perspective (including both developed and developing nations) on how COVID-19 has impacted access to and delivery of cancer therapies.
32473600, This perspective was prepared by the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners, with input from national and regional oncology pharmacy practice groups (42 practice leaders from 28 countries and regions) who contributed to a snapshot survey between 10 and 22 April 2020.
32473600, Specifically, we highlight challenges related to safe handling of hazardous drugs and maintaining high-quality medication safety standards that have impacted various stakeholders.
32473600, Calling on previous experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during the 2015 outbreak, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy quickly formed a COVID-19 task force team to develop a manual before the first index case was diagnosed in the hemodialysis unit.
32473600, This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within hemodialysis facilities, which were developed to protect patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers from this highly transmissible virus.
32473600, The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.
32473600, We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and hemodialysis patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells.
32473600, Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication.
32473600, We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, Furthermore, our findings provide insight for the development of therapy options for COVID-19.
32473600, Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease.
32473600, In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases.

32473600, Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication.
32473600, As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy.
32473600, Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Currently, there is no established guideline specific to hematology and oncology fellowship programs.
32473600, While understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all, shared experiences can assist training programs to incorporate best practices and customize their programs to provide an active educational environment that balances patient care needs, didactics, scholarly activities, and wellbeing during the process of rapid changes and adaptation.
32473600, We share our hematology/oncology fellowship program's restructuring approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Hyper-immune/convalescent plasma derived from recently recovered donors seems to be useful to treat COVID-19 patients, an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents.
32473600, The endpoints are the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of these patients.
32473600, However, the efficacy of hyper-immune/convalescent plasma treatment for severe infectious diseases is still controversial.
32473600, The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of hyper- immune/convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
32473600, We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10).
32473600, Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event.
32473600, We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions.
32473600, We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low.
32473600, No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed.
32473600, There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin.

32473600, The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease.
32473600, The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease.
32473600, Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic.
32473600, The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.

32473600, There seems no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery over open surgery.
32473600, But do not underestimate the risks, perform surgery on COVID-19 positive patients only when necessary, and keep using logical and common sense to protect yourself and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.
32473600, There is no valid evidence, published in English, which establishes any benefit of USWD in pulmonary conditions, let alone COVID-19.
32473600, The need for rigorous research and evidence-based practice is discussed in this article.
32473600, Novel interventions require a solid physiological basis and must undergo rigorous testing prior to clinical adoption even during a pandemic.
32473600, We are of the view that deployment of USWD in patients with COVID-19 must be prudent and supported by a logical scientific basis.
32473600, With the fast-response experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently.
32473600, Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro's pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes.
32473600, By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called "anchor" site.
32473600, Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro's inhibitors with a high binding affinity.
32473600, Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control.
32473600, To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined.
32473600, Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals.
32473600, It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment.
32473600, The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses.
32473600, The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.
32473600, Systematic reviews of such practices have shown improvements in measures of anxiety, depression and pain scores.
32473600, Structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the brains of people with a long term traditional meditation practice, and in people who have completed a MBSR programme.

32473600, Introducing a mindfulness and meditation practice during this pandemic has the potential to complement treatment and is a low cost beneficial method of providing support with anxiety for all.
32473600, Molecular dynamics simulation further showed that Viomycin embedded deeply inside the binding pocket and formed robust binding with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.

32473600, If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions.
32473600, Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration.
32473600, In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective.
32473600, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists.
32473600, Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.
32473600, Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored.
32473600, People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems.
32473600, Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.
32473600, This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.
32473600, In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research.
32473600, By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period.
32473600, At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine.
32473600, The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.
32473600, Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.This article has been co-published with permission in the European Heart Journal and EuroIntervention.

32473600, It is important to identify vulnerable populations who will be impacted most by this pandemic leading to higher mortality rates compared to the general healthy population.
32473600, Although older patients and patients with co-morbidities fall into this vulnerable group, patients with hematologic and oncologic malignancies on active cytotoxic treatments are at even greater risk as they are both myelosuppressed and immunosuppressed.
32473600, In addition to following the universal guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it is important to also institute guidelines for cancer centers to help protect this vulnerable population.
32473600, We review the current data, risks, and recommendations for COVID-19 in cancer patients.
32473600, In essence, they are immunosuppressed in different intensities during their treatment.
32473600, Most of them are elderly and all of them require long-term therapy, with prolonged contact with the health care system, possibly including a stem cell transplant during the treatment.

32473600, However, a wide range of efficacy rates have been reported, and few placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, limiting our understanding of FMT efficacy and safety.
32473600, We discuss the current knowledge gaps driven by questions around the quality and consistency of clinical trial results, patient selection, diagnostic methodologies, use of suppressive antibiotic therapy, and methods for adverse event reporting.

32473600, In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values<0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32473600, Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. (RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005).The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.

32473600, The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available.Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone.
32473600, Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days).
32473600, Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US.Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices.
32473600, Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Virus Eradication published by Mediscript.

32473600, We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS.
32473600, Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated.

32473600, There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001].Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs.
32473600, However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied.
32473600, Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment.
32473600, Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Virus Eradication published by Mediscript.
32473600, In this hospital 125 nurses were enrolled in COVID-19 center.In the present study 5 out of 125 nurses (4%) who enrolled in COVID-19 infection center, were infected with COVID-19.
32473600, They were first positive for real-time PCR but the CT scan was positive for just one of them.
32473600, None of the infected nurses were hospitalized and all of them preferred to be quarantine at home and receive the necessary care and treatment (Oseltamivir, Azithromycin and Kaletra.This study showed that regardless of self caring, the nurses were exposed to COVID-19.
32473600, Because at the the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Iran, there were no special protection against this infection.Therfore they were at risk for the COVID-19.This study also reported that receiving the necessary care and treatment at home was a good experience for nurses that can be used in some cases.© 2020 The Author(s).

32473600, Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.
32473600, Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself.
32473600, The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
32473600, In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, The number of fatalities was fast rising.
32473600, Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov.
32473600, It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.

32473600, This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient.
32473600, This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19.

32473600, The flow cytometry assay was performed to examine the numbers of lymphocyte subsets.CD3+, CD4+ and CD8 + T lymphocyte subsets were decreased in COVID-19-infected patients.
32473600, Compared with the moderate group and the sever group, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the critical group decreased greatly (P < 0.001, P = 0.005 or P = 0.001).Reduced CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocyte counts may reflect the severity of the COVID-19.

32473600, On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased.
32473600, Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis.
32473600, In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease.Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days.
32473600, The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days.
32473600, Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal-pro hormone and D-dimer levels.BRACE CORONA will evaluate whether the strategy of continued ACEI/ARB therapy compared with temporary discontinuation of these drugs impacts clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, guidance by scientific evidence is often unavailable, and impactful decisions are inevitably made on the basis of expert opinions.
32473600, Here we report how the seven comprehensive cancer centers of Cancer Core Europe have organized their healthcare systems at an unprecedented scale and pace to make their operations 'pandemic proof'. We identify and discuss many commonalities, but also important local differences, and pinpoint critical research priorities to enable evidence-based remodeling of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Also, we discuss how the current situation offers a unique window of opportunity for assessing the effects of de-escalating anticancer regimens, which may fast-forward the development of more-refined and less-toxic treatments.
32473600, By sharing our joint experiences, we offer a roadmap for proceeding and aim to mobilize the global research community to generate the data that are critically needed to offer the best possible care to patients.
32473600, The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days.
32473600, There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment.
32473600, All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.
32473600, RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.
32473600, In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface.
32473600, This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic.
32473600, In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a "tele-bridge" clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment.
32473600, In this correspondence we briefly share our experience developing this common sense approach to addressing the complex problem of access to treatment only now permissible due to regulatory changes during COVID-19.
32473600, Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist.
32473600, A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective.
32473600, There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available.
32473600, This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine.Copyright © 2020 Triggle et al.

32473600, Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
32473600, Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
32473600, In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
32473600, Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
32473600, During the last number of weeks, tele-child-psychiatry and psychotherapy have increased, and outpatient services have been used cautiously and sparingly.
32473600, Medical staff numbers will be augmented by doctors and nurses returning from retirement and also by medical students on a voluntary basis.
32473600, The federal government has warned that discrepancies in education will increase due to the closure of schools.
32473600, Questions of child protection are currently of particular importance in the context of such closures and the non-availability of day-care centres.
32473600, By contrast, the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far represents approximately 1.0% of the total deaths expected to occur worldwide over the first three months of the current year.
32473600, It seems, therefore, that the number of infants expected to be conceived and born -but who will not be so due to the lockdown of infertility services- might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, We herein propose remedies that include a prognostic-stratification of more vulnerable infertility cases in order to plan a progressive restart of worldwide fertility treatments.
32473600, At a time when preventing complications and limiting burdens for national health systems represent relevant issues, our viewpoint might help competent authorities and health care providers to identify patients who should be prioritized for the continuation of fertility care in a safe environment.
32473600, For example, the government adopted measures to curb the exponential spread of the virus, which included a significant reduction in social contacts.
32473600, Furthermore, the specialist societies recommended that no elective treatments be carried out during the pandemic period.
32473600, This review article considers epidemiological aspects of novel corona virus infection and presents both the clinical as well the possible economic effects of the pandemic on gynaecology, obstetrics and reproductive medicine in Germany in the past, present and future.
32473600, In addition, useful preventive measures for daily clinical work and the previously known scientific findings dealing with the impact of corona virus on pregnancy and birth are discussed.
32473600, Healthcare professionals from all specialties are facing this situation and designing guidelines and recommendations that are contributing to the literature that is crucial for disease management at the current time.
32473600, We share our experience with two ends of the spectra that we currently observe in spine patients.
32473600, One group of patients included the non-operative cases that presented with back pain.
32473600, Further, we discuss our experience with operative precautions and digitally assisted discharge.
32473600, A total of forty-three studies were included.
32473600, Liver anomalies were predominantly mild to moderately elevated transaminases, hypoalbuminemia and prolongation of prothrombin time.
32473600, Histopathology varied between non-specific inflammation, mild steatosis, congestion and massive necrosis.
32473600, More studies to elucidate the mechanism and importance of liver injury on the clinical course and prognosis in patients with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection are warranted.

32473600, In a very short period, the medical practice framework has been changed to a 'catastrophe medicine' scenario, with the consequent change in the decision-making parameters.
32473600, In this context, the allocation of resources or the prioritization of treatment become crucial elements, and it is important to have an ethical reference framework to be able to make the necessary clinical decisions.
32473600, For this, a process of narrative review of the evidence has been carried out, followed by a unsystematic consensus of experts, which has resulted in both the publication of a position paper and recommendations from SEMICYUC itself, and the consensus between 18 scientific societies and 5 institutes/chairs of bioethics and palliative care of a framework document of reference for general ethical recommendations in this context of crisis.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases.
32473600, Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19.Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.

32473600, Overall, 7 patients (25%) died.
32473600, Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization.In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT.
32473600, Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients.
32473600, Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.
32473600, Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
32473600, Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
32473600, All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
32473600, The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
32473600, One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis.
32473600, No patients died during the study.Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

32473600, Detailed treatment advice and options are given at a tumor stream level.
32473600, We must maintain care for patients with cancer as best we can and recognize that COVID-19 poses a significant competing risk for death that changes conventional treatment paradigms.
32473600, Some experimental data suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase ACE2 levels, thus raising concerns on their security in Covid-19 positive patients.
32473600, However, some studies have shown protection by these drugs in lower tract respiratory infections and ARDS.
32473600, The actual consensus is to continue the treatment with RAAS inhibitors, abrupt withdrawal, especially in patients with cardiac or renal conditions, being hazardous in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, except in patients hospitalized in intensive care with hemodynamic instability.
32473600, This position statement is actually unanimous among all international learned societies.
32473600, The aim of this manuscript is to comprehensively summarize the current knowledge on the antihyperglycemic properties of HCQ and to critically evaluate the potential risks and benefits related to HCQ use in patients with diabetes, even in light of the current pandemic scenario.

32473600, The current outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) illustrated difficulties in lack of effective drugs for treatment.
32473600, Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for early recognition and treatment of infectious diseases, allowing timely implementation of infection control, improved clinical care and other public health measures to stop the spread of the disease.
32473600, CRISPR-Cas technology speed up the development of infectious disease diagnostics with high rapid and accurate.
32473600, In this review, we summarise current advance regarding diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, in the development of fast, accurate and portable diagnostic tests and highlight the potential of CRISPR-Cas13 in COVID-19 Pneumonia and other emerging infectious diseases diagnosis.
32473600, With contributions from the leadership of the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), Children's Oncology Group (COG), St Jude Global program, and Childhood Cancer International, we have sought to provide a framework for healthcare teams caring for children with cancer during the pandemic.
32473600, We anticipate the burden will fall particularly heavily on children, their families, and cancer services in low- and middle-income countries.
32473600, Therefore, we have brought together the relevant clinical leads from SIOP Europe, COG, and SIOP-PODC (Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) to focus on the six most curable cancers that are part of the WHO Global Initiative in Childhood Cancer.
32473600, We provide some practical advice for adapting diagnostic and treatment protocols for children with cancer during the pandemic, the measures taken to contain it (e.g., extreme social distancing), and how to prepare for the anticipated recovery period.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, Based on lessons learned from prior studies and clinical delivery of CPT via telehealth, recommendations are made with regard to overall strategies for adapting CPT to a telehealth format, including how to conduct routine assessments and ensure treatment fidelity.

32473600,The severity of COVID-19 disease has led to an urgent need for the discovery of new treatments.
32473600, Thus, global stocks of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been put under pressure with a study of 26 patients treated with HCQ during their infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Despite the study's lack of quality, several countries' medicines agencies subsequently issued guidelines for the use of HCQ for COVID-19.
32473600, This review aims to elucidate potential mechanisms, which make HCQ treatment interesting in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the current evidence for clinical use of HCQ to treat COVID-19.
32473600, In conclusion, our report of patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19 respectively, may indicate that lung transplant recipients are not per se at risk for severe COVID-19.
32473600, Further observations and controlled trials are urgently needed to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant recipients.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Two patients conservatively treated died.
32473600, The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6.
32473600, ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support.Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients.
32473600, Complete patient history and examination, routine ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and careful evaluation of changes in cardiac enzymes should be part of the regular assessment procedures also in dedicated COVID positive units.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, At the same time, in the near future, clinical trials in COVID-19 patients will produce an enormous quantity of clinical and translational data on the control of inflammation, and complement/microthrombosis activation.
32473600, These data will represent a legacy to be transformed into innovation in the transplant field.
32473600, It will be our contribution to change a dramatic event into advancement for the transplant field, and ultimately for our patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), p=0.034.
32473600, There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.These results suggest overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.
32473600, Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600,SARS-CoV-2 viruses are positive single-stranded RNA viruses, whose infection can be asymptomatic or lead to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
32473600, Covid-19 is a respiratory infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis leading to several cardiovascular complications.
32473600, Hematologic consequences of this new infection allowed medical community to start new treatment approaches concerning infection going from targeted anti-inflammatory drugs to anticoagulation or stem cell therapies.
32473600, A better understanding of Covid-19 pathophysiology, in particular hematological disorders, will help to choose appropriate treatment strategies.
32473600, Case analysis indicated that the nervous system can be invaded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that 36.4% of COVID-19 patients had neurological symptoms.
32473600, Importantly, the involvement of the CNS may be associated with poor prognosis and disease worsening.
32473600, Here, we discussed the symptoms and evidence of nervous system involvement (directly and indirectly) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible mechanisms.
32473600, CNS symptoms could be a potential indicator of poor prognosis; therefore, the prevention and treatment of CNS symptoms are also crucial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P < 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010).
32473600, However, CT scores of the peak and absorption stages were not correlated with any parameter (P > 0.0125).
32473600, No sex difference occurred regarding CT score (P > 0.05).Severity of lung abnormalities quantified on chest CT might correlate with laboratory parameters in the early and progressive stages.
32473600, However, larger cohort studies are necessary.
32473600, Throat swabs were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32473600, Chest CT plays a key role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, providing an accurate diagnosis and is a sensitive technique for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.

32473600, He subsequently developed unilateral weakness.
32473600, Computer tomography identified a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
32473600, A subsequent test for COVID-19 was positive.
32473600, This is the first report of CVST as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection.Thrombotic events may be the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19.These thrombotic events include stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and cardiac complications.Clinicians should carefully consider the risk of thrombosis in patients positive for COVID-19, including prophylaxis and treatment beyond discharge.© EFIM 2020.
32473600,Younger patients with COVID-19 may experience an exaggerated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life threatening.
32473600, There is no proven antiviral therapy for COVID-19 so far, but profound immunosuppression has recently been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19-associated CRS.
32473600, We present a case of life-threatening CRS caused by COVID-19 infection with a favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy with tocilizumab (TCZ).
32473600, The rapid clinical and biochemical improvement following TCZ administration suggests that treatment with immunotherapy can be life-saving in selected patients with COVID-19-induced CRS.Cytokine release syndrome may cause sudden and potentially life-threatening clinical deterioration in COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in younger patients.Immunosuppressive therapy may provide important additional therapeutic benefit in these patients.Tocilizumab, a specific IL-6 inhibitor, led to dramatic clinical improvement in a young patient with severe COVID-19-associated cytokine release syndrome.© EFIM 2020.
32473600,COVID-19, also called severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan, China.
32473600, It has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO.
32473600, Influenza occurs mainly during the winter, with the burden of disease determined by several factors, including the effectiveness of the vaccine that season, the characteristics of the circulating viruses, and how long the season lasts.
32473600, We describe the case of a 66-year-old woman who was diagnosed with influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection.COVID-19 can co-occur with other viral infections.Some of these co-infections have active treatments, while supportive treatment is the mainstay of treatment for others.© EFIM 2020.
32473600, Risk factors associated with ARDS and death are older age, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia), neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction.
32473600, Disseminated intravascular coagulation and coagulopathy can contribute to death.
32473600, Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32473600, In this report we describe two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed venous thromboembolism.Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis does not decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 pneumonia.In the presence of clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, compression ultrasound and echocardiography should be always performed, irrespective of disease stage.© EFIM 2020.
32473600, CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human deaths worldwide.
32473600, Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020.
32473600, Its risks and pandemic potential have brought global consideration.
32473600, We summarized epidemiology, virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.© The author(s).
32473600, Economic vulnerabilities may be the reason for workers' reluctance to taking time off work to attend hospital/clinic.
32473600, These imply a need for involving local pharmacies, commune health centers, traditional health providers or village health collaborators as local health gatekeepers who are the first point of detecting and reporting of suspected COVID-19 cases, as well as a channel where accurate information regarding COVID-19, protective equipment, and intervention packages can be delivered.

32473600, This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes.
32473600, Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention.The COVID-19 pandemic allows models of chronic healthcare to be rethought.
32473600, Current practices are resource-intensive and there is a need to simplify titration and monitoring protocols in CVD.
32473600, Moving toward the use of polypill combinations allied with telehealth consultations may be one solution.
32473600, Justification for suspension of planned provision of services in the first phase of a pandemic was presented.
32473600, The indication of the best medical practices for the time of stabilization, but with the persistence of the risk of COVID-19 infection in the population are discussed.
32473600, The possibility of providing services in the following months of the pandemic is important.
32473600, We provide the rationale for launching medical activities and indicate optimal practices until the consolidation of SARS COV-2 prevention and treatment methods.
32473600, A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone.There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection.
32473600, There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine.
32473600, The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established.
32473600, Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.Copyright © 2020, The Authors.
32473600, This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use.
32473600, Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy.
32473600, Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the "viral program". Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication.To our knowledge, cancer drugs potentially suitable for facing SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been carefully reviewed.
32473600, We present here a comprehensive analysis of available information on potential candidate cancer drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of COIVD-19.
32473600, Top three bioactive molecules (Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate) were selected by comparing their docking scores with repurposed drugs (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Oolonghomobisflavan-A molecule showed a good number of hydrogen bonds with Mpro and higher MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to all three repurposed drug molecules. during the time of simulation.
32473600, This study showed Oolonghomobisflavan-A as a potential bioactive molecule to act as an inhibitor for the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. [Formula: see text]Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32473600, The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32473600, To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
32473600, Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
32473600, Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.
32473600, Conclusions: TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients.
32473600, Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32473600, Indeed, treatment of CRS involves the use of both antivirals to control the underlying infection and immunosuppressive agents to dampen the aberrant pro-inflammatory response of the host.
32473600, Several trials, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressants commonly used in rheumatic diseases, are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 and CRS, some of which are achieving promising results.
32473600, However, such a use should follow a multidisciplinary approach, be accompanied by close monitoring, be tailored to patient's clinical and serological features, and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results.
32473600, Autoimmune patients receiving immunosuppressants could be prone to SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, suspension of the ongoing therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares and a consequent increase in the infection risk.
32473600, Recently, Hermans, et.al., outlined the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic pose for the bleeding disorders community 1 . The general response to the pandemic has included increased measures focused on personal hygiene, social distancing, symptom monitoring, early diagnosis, patient isolation, shelter in place, and public health quarantine.
32473600, Accordingly, such measures have led to concerns over how to maintain access to haemophilia treatment products and to the specialized integrated care medical follow up within the haemophilia treatment centers (HTCs).
32473600, As part of the medical response to disasters such as a world-wide pandemic, telemedicine has emerged as one proposed solution to address this type of global challenge 2 .This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, But acute stroke care and poststroke rehabilitation in the country have limitations owing to the economic constraints and poor access to health care.
32473600, The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has made stroke care even more challenging.
32473600, We outline the unfavorable circumstances in stroke care induced by the pandemic; propose mitigating measures; crisis management; and provide a comparative evaluation of stroke care between India and the United States during the pandemic.

32473600, Conclusions and Relevance.
32473600, COVID-19 patients require ENT consultation for many reasons, including tracheotomy.
32473600, Otolaryngologists play an indispensable role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but, due to their work, are at high risk of exposure.
32473600, Appropriate protective strategies can prevent infection of otolaryngologists.
32473600, During this pandemic when information quickly evolves in the presence of contradicting messages and misinformation, the role of the pharmacist is essential.
32473600, Here, we review theoretical mechanisms and evidence related to efficacy and safety of select supplements in the setting of COVID-19, including vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, elderberry, and silver.
32473600, Evidence evaluating these supplements in COVID-19 patients is lacking, and providers and patients should not rely on dietary supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19.
32473600, Rather, reference to evidence-based guidelines should guide treatment decisions.
32473600, The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%).
32473600, From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24).
32473600, The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93).
32473600, The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/).In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness.
32473600, These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020.Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged.
32473600, Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death.Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities.
32473600, Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death.
32473600, Therefore, it is best to be regularly assessed these markers during treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention.
32473600, The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis.
32473600, The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.
32473600, Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.
32473600, Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days.
32473600, Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen's Kappa for nominal variables.Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment.
32473600, Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use.Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients.
32473600, Its validation for remote use over the telephone will support staff to monitor clients' risks and outcomes-of particular relevance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in which services are increasingly relying on telework approaches to client monitoring.© 2020 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.
32473600, Nevertheless, hospitalizations occur and there is a risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32473600, During the COVID-19 pandemic, typical resources used to help manage patients, such as dental services, interventional radiology, rehabilitation and others are limited or not at all available.
32473600, Recognizing the need to provide access to treatment and the anticipated toxicity of such treatment, we have developed and implemented guidelines for clinical care management with the hope of avoiding added risk to our patients.
32473600, If successful, these concepts may be integrated into our care directives in non-pandemic times.© 2020 The Author(s).
32473600, The evaluation of results was made based on Glide (Schrödinger) dock score.
32473600, Out of 62 screened compounds, the best docking scores with the targets were found for compounds: lopinavir, amodiaquine, and theaflavin digallate (TFDG).
32473600, Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study was also performed for 20 ns to confirm the stability behaviour of the main protease and inhibitor complexes.
32473600, The MD simulation study validated the stability of three compounds in the protein binding pocket as potent binders.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32473600, At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment.
32473600, After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.
32473600, We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32473600, But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups.
32473600, In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups.We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups.
32473600, These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32473600, Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients.
32473600, In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others.
32473600, We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
32473600, This review intends to discuss the symptoms, prevention, and management carried out related to the coronavirus, while also providing the healthcare provider strategies used by different countries in combating the disease.This study was conducted over a period of 2 weeks where different sources were used to assess the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19.
32473600, The data used in this study was verified and collected from authentic sources only.Results show that there is at present no definite cure for the disease and that prevention is the best possible defense at our disposal at the moment.
32473600, Data reviewed suggests that social distancing and isolation is the best possible option at the moment.This study provides an overview of the developments taking place in response to the pandemic.
32473600, More research is required, especially in the treatment and prevention of the disease, so that we may progress towards finding a cure as well as creating a vaccine for the COVID-19.© Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.
32473600, Veno-venous ECMO was initiated on hospital day 7 in conjunction with a 10-day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment with remdesivir.
32473600, The patient's condition improved significantly and she was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 17 (ECMO day 11).
32473600, She was successfully extubated and eventually discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 28.This case report demonstrates a positive outcome in a young patient with COVID-19 treated by the judicious application of ECMO in conjunction with compassionate use antiviral treatment (remdesivir).
32473600, Future prospective multi-center studies are needed to validate these findings in a larger cohort of patients.© The Author(s) 2020.
32473600, Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients.
32473600, In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors.
32473600, While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means.

32473600, This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome.
32473600, DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19.
32473600, Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV.
32473600, Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms.
32473600, Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids.
32473600, Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600, To maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system, the protection of healthcare providers should be the top priority.
32473600, On the other hand, patients, who need emergency healthcare, should also be provided with appropriate treatment.
32473600, Healthcare professionals should choose a treatment method appropriately in the circumstances to protect themselves and their patients as much as possible.
32473600, This paper aims to summarize how a surgeon may act appropriately when an intervention is inevitable during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600,Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still scarce.
32473600, This case series of 33 PLWH patients with COVID-19 reveals symptoms and outcome in this special population.Retrospective analysis of anonymized data including age, gender, HIV-associated parameters, symptoms, and outcome.Three out of 32 patients with documented outcomes died (9%). 91% of the patients recovered and 76% have been classified as mild cases.
32473600, All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir.This preliminary case series does not support excess morbidity and mortality among symptomatic COVID-19 PLWH and with viral suppression on ART.
32473600, SARS-CoV-2 infections may occur during boosted darunavir-based and/or on tenofovir-containing ART.
32473600,COVID19 pandemic poses a global threat, with many unknowns.
32473600, The potential for resource limited countries to suffer huge mortality is of major concern.
32473600, Prevention and risk reduction strategies are paramount in the current absence of effective treatment or a vaccine.
32473600, There is a global shortage of personal protective equipment.This short paper describes the rationale for and development of a cloth homemade mask and has a step by step video.The template is reproducible around the world and is both washable and cheap.This article describes a simple way to make a cloth mask, suitable if medical masks are not available.

32473600, Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/L), all studies had approximately one-tenth the necessary concentration for in-vitro viral inhibition.
32473600, Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose.We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro.
32473600, Nevertheless, patients receiving hydroxychloroquine long-term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma.
32473600, Because the therapeutic window for hydroxychloroquine in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine.
32473600, HCQ is the only SLE treatment shown to increase survival and any change in the HCQ regimen is potentially dangerous.
32473600, Changes in the HCQ regimen should be made jointly with the patient after a discussion of the available evidence and expert opinion and the patient's preferences.

32473600, While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG).
32473600, The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind.
32473600, It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain.

32473600, The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
32473600, After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
32473600, Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
32473600, Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
32473600, For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined.
32473600, The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS.
32473600, The clotting factors values were compared between the groups.At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs. 455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group.
32473600, The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs. 567 (472.5-644.50); p = 0.0003).Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.
32473600, With a mortality rate of 1-5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of >30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia.
32473600, Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations.

32473600, The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]).
32473600, In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]).
32473600, In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings.Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
32473600, However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.
32473600,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, chloroquine has been mentioned as a possible treatment.
32473600, In vitro studies have shown anti-viral activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Recently, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment published treatment options for antiviral treatment for COVID-19 where chloroquine was suggested as first choice for off-label treatment, beside remdesivir en lopinavir/ritonavir.
32473600, In this commentary, we provide a background and history of chloroquine, the evidence for antiviral efficacy of chloroquine and the arguments for off-label use of chloroquine in COVID-19.
32473600, The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.96; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.86; P < 0.001]. The single cut-off point and high level of cTnI predicted risk of in-hospital death, hazard ratio (HR) was 4.56 (95% CI, 1.28-16.28; P = 0.019) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46; P = 0.004), respectively.
32473600, In multivariable logistic regression, senior age, comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high level of C-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury.The risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe COVID-19 can be predicted by markers of myocardial injury, and was significantly associated with senior age, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular comorbidities.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

32473600, Two core combinations and one novel formula were discovered in the study.Yin Qiao powder and Huopo Xialing decoction are the basic formulations for Weifen syndrome of COVID-19.
32473600, In addition, Maxing Shigan decoction, Liang Ge powder, Qingwen Baidu decoction and Da Yuan decoction are the basic formulations for Qifen syndrome of COVID-19.
32473600, The main medication characteristics are clearing heat, entilating lung, removing toxicity and removing turbidity.
32473600, It shows that removing toxicity and eliminating evil are the prescription thought in treating epidemic disease of traditional Chinese medicine.
32473600, The lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage decreased and the inflammatory indicators significantly increased in case 2.
32473600, All patients were treated with antiviral, antitussive, oxygen inhalation; case 3 received glucocorticoids, case 2 with severe illness received glucocorticoids and additionally gamma globulin.
32473600, All three cases were cured and discharged.
32473600, Case 1 with early pregnancy chose to terminate pregnancy after discharge; case 2 chose to continue pregnancy without obstetric complications; and case 3 had cesarean section delivery due to abnormal fetal heart monitoring.The report shows that COVID-19 in pregnancy women could be cured with active treatment, and the maternal and fetal outcomes can be satisfactory.
32473600, Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
32473600, Secondly, an initial ow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
32473600, Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
32473600, Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
32473600, The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, P>0.05]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day]. Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations.
32473600, Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P>0.05).The prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good.
32473600, Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Subsequent research should determine better endpoint and fully consider the feasibility of experiments such as sample size.
32473600, With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
32473600, Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged.
32473600, There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization.
32473600, There were no deaths and no medical staff infections.The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.
32473600,To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis.Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020.
32473600, Their clinical baseline data were collected.
32473600, The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale.
32473600, Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients.Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05).During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.
32473600, No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients.
32473600, The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions.
32473600, CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
32473600, Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.CT images of patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
32473600, Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes.
32473600, During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare,the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation.
32473600, The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission.
32473600, On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%).The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32473600, Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted.
32473600, By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed.The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province.
32473600, Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people.
32473600, In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people.The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.
32473600, We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
32473600, It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32473600, Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
32473600, However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32473600, The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections.
32473600, Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.

32473600, Taking China, the United States, Australia, and Canada as examples, this study compares and analyzes the reserve and supply systems of emergency medical supplies and problems exposed in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.
32473600, Some common problems were found, such as insufficient types and quantities of emergency medical supplies in reserve, insufficient emergency production capacity, and imperfect command mechanism for emergency supplies deployment and transportation.
32473600, A sound reserve system of emergency medical supplies is the basis and guarantee for dealing with public health emergencies such as major outbreaks.
32473600, Based on the comparison of systems and practical experience, countries around the world should further improve the reserve and supply system of emergency medical supplies, and improve the coordination and cooperation mechanism for emergency supplies for international public health emergencies, so as to cope with increasingly severe public health emergencies in the context of globalization.
32473600, Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution.
32473600, HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods.

32473600, The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as experimental treatments for COVID-19 leading to a shortage of both medications.
32473600, A literature review conducted in April 2020 shows a lack of high-quality data available, resulting in ambiguous guideline recommendations.
32473600, Decisions to use either drug should be made with careful consideration of risks versus benefits along with proper monitoring.
32473600, Because of its higher potency and better safety profile, hydroxychloroquine may be the more reasonable treatment option if treatment is initiated.
32473600, Due to its high virulence and the absence of immunity among the general population, SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread to all countries.
32473600, This pandemic highlights the urgent unmet need to expand and focus our research tools on what are considered "neglected infectious diseases" and to prepare for future inevitable pandemics.
32473600, This global emergency has generated unprecedented momentum and scientific efforts around the globe unifying scientists from academia, government and the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate the discovery of vaccines and treatments.
32473600, Herein, we shed light on the virus structure and life cycle and the potential therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 and briefly refer to both active and passive immunization modalities, drug repurposing focused on speed to market, and novel agents against specific viral targets as therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.
32473600, Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32473600, Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative.
32473600, In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic.
32473600, Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.
32473600, Conclusions: No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.
32473600, Furthermore, the combination usage of LPV/r and arbidol may not benefit for improving the disease.
32473600, Noteworthy, the adverse reactions of the antiviral drugs should be paid careful attention during the treatment.
32473600, The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins.
32473600, Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms.
32473600, It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms.

32473600,In the current dismal situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective management of patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome is of vital importance.
32473600, Due to the current lack of effective pharmacological concepts, this situation has caused interest in (re)considering historical reports on the treatment of patients with low-dose radiation therapy for pneumonia.
32473600, Although these historical reports are of low-level evidence per se, hampering recommendations for decision-making in the clinical setting, they indicate effectiveness in the dose range between 0.3 and 1 Gy, similar to more recent dose concepts in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory/degenerative benign diseases with, e.g., a single dose per fraction of 0.5 Gy.
32473600, This concise review aims to critically review the evidence for low-dose radiation treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy and discuss whether it is worth investigating in the present clinical situation.
32473600, Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma.
32473600, These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder.

32473600, In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic.
32473600, In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population.
32473600, Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment.In this paper we report on a patient treated with natalizumab for relapsing MS who developed COVID-19 and recovered in a few days without complications.After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms.This case supports the opportunity to avoid discontinuing or delaying the retreatment over 8 weeks in patients recovered from a recent COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "diabetes", "diabetes mellitus", "SARS", "infection" and "management of diabetes mellitus" with interposition of the Boolean operator "AND".Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19.
32473600, On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus.The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19.
32473600, Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment.We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, France.
32473600, We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions.Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P<0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P=0.037 and higher CRP level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25).
32473600, However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, P=0.002).Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

32473600,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted extensive attention all around the world recently.
32473600, Early screening, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment remain the most effective prevention and control measures.
32473600, Computed tomography (CT) plays a vital role in the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of COVID-19, especially in the early screening, with a higher sensitivity than that of real-time fluorescence RT-PCR.
32473600, The combination of CT and artificial intelligence has the potential to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency.
32473600, The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P< 0.01).Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics.
32473600, The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT.
32473600, Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes.
32473600, Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.
32473600, Three patients were reported with negative results in the initial and follow-up CT examination.
32473600, One patient was reported with initial negative CT findings but turning positive during the first follow-up.
32473600, All patients had absorbed lesions on follow-up CT images after treatment.Pediatric COVID-19 patients have certain imaging and clinical features as well as disease prognosis.
32473600, Children with COVID-19 tend to have normal or subtle CT findings and relatively better outcome.
32473600, Chest imaging examination is an important auxiliary examination method in diagnosis of COVID-19.
32473600, To further standardize the imaging examination and diagnosis of COVID-19, Hunan Society of Radiology together with Imaging Technology Professional Committee of Hunan Medical Association reach an expert consensus document on imaging examination, diagnosis, and control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19.
32473600, This document summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging examination procedure, imaging findings, CT staging, the value of imaging examination, and the methods for control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19 during imaging examination.
32473600, Furthermore, it extends the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in children.
32473600, The main subject words were divided into three main categories, namely, CoVs epidemiology, basic research and drug development, in which basic research and drug development were strongly correlated.
32473600, In the subject words breakthrough analysis, there were time-related breakthrough points in 1991, 1996 and 2002, and the "diagnosis" and "sequence" were continuous hot spots.Through the visualization analysis of knowledge graph, the development trend and hot spots of CoVs therapy research could be well observed.
32473600, In this study, the degree of attention in the field of CoVs treatment showed periodic changes, related to the outbreak of new CoVs, and the country, institutions and the author were closely related.
32473600, The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation in order to develop new targets of drug.
32473600, We should always remember and learn lessons from the past, which could be promoted to all over the country, even the world.
32473600, Many phenomena and problems in the work of epidemic prevention, control and treatment are worthy of our deep reflection.
32473600, We should use scientific approach and dialectical materialism to make a practical and realistic summary.
32473600, The purpose is to win the battle as soon as possible, and more importantly, to avoid repeating the same mistakes and prevent pestilence before it happens.
32473600, The COVID19 emergency pandemic does not imply an under-treatment of existing skin conditions, which together with the SARS-Cov2 infection may jeopardize the patient's life.

32473600, All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician's responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements.
32473600, There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice.There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive.
32473600, Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational.
32473600, Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.
32473600, Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation.
32473600, While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on "anti-viral" and "anti-inflammatory" strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue.
32473600, Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression.
32473600, Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.
32473600, Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy.
32473600, Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease.
32473600, In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.
32473600, Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic.
32473600, In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence.
32473600, Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.
32473600, There are differing government financial mitigations in place across dental practices for NHS and, to an extent private, activity, as well as for the dental industry.
32473600, Dentistry is generally classified in the very high-risk category of aerosol production through many aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
32473600, To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved.
32473600, From a dental industry perspective, equipment and product manufacturers and suppliers are building upon, and further developing, the industry's extremely close relationship and partnership with the dental profession, in order to develop and implement new ways of thinking and new approaches, products and techniques to protect patients and clinicians, focusing on a return to the more widespread provision of dentistry.
32473600, The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women.
32473600, They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences.
32473600, Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences.
32473600, This will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.

32473600, We here propose practical guidance for the in-hospital specific management of haemophilia persons with COVID-19 including their possible transfer to intensive care unit.
32473600, Rapid identification of the haemophilia status, undelayed and regular liaison with the haemophilia team, proper therapy with factor concentrates or alternative treatments appear instrumental to prevent haemophilia-related complications in this setting.
32473600, Information of patients and their families about COVID-19, psychological support and good appreciation of the impact of haemophilia on therapeutic decisions including end of life directives are also addressed.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, This might be due to the fact that ACE2 is the receptor for the virus to enter human cells, but, on the contrary, that ACE2 expression is downregulated following SARS-1 infection, resulting in disproportionate activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and exacerbated pneumonia progression.
32473600, However, no solid clinical data are available at the present moment to support or disprove such hypotheses.
32473600, We announce in this letter that a large multicentre case-control study has been started in Italy that is the country with a very high impact of COVID-19 infection.
32473600, We hope that our letter will encourage other clinical centres, even outside Italy, to join our study.
32473600,Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe adult respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 that has resulted in the current global pandemic.
32473600, Currently, there is no available treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, but multiple medications, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are used off label.
32473600, We report the case of a 60-year-old woman without any cardiac history who developed right bundle brunch block and critically prolonged corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc 631 ms) after treatment for 3 days with HCQ, which resolved on discontinuation of the medication.
32473600, This case highlights a significant and potentially life-threatening complication of HCQ use.
32473600, Newly reported eruptions like vascular lesions and peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions caused concern among dermatologists.
32473600, Exanthems were widely distributed and were primarily located on the trunk.
32473600, Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis were also carefully summarized.
32473600, This study reviewed the recently published COVID-19 studies with skin manifestations, which may pave the way for further research.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600,Explore how to manage oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak.In order to solve oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital has taken effective measures: build a team of experts, which provide a 24-h hotline, online video consultation, and online training and push popular science articles on WeChat.
32473600, For the treatment of emergency patients aside from routine epidemic prevention measures, some special measures for oral treatment need to be added.From January 23, 2020, to March 2, 2020, a total of 3035 patients received oral therapy during the COVID-19 epidemic in our hospital.
32473600, To our knowledge, no oral health worker or patient has been infected with COVID-19 due to oral treatment, and no patients have complained about the suspension of treatment by complaints hotline.COVID-19 is a novel challenge for oral healthcare.
32473600, Attention should be paid to oral healthcare during the outbreak of COVID-19.These experiences of oral healthcare can be used as a reference by stomatological hospitals and oral clinics during public health emergencies.
32473600, Currently, there is still no licensed specific antiviral treatment for the human coronavirus disease and a vaccine will not be ready soon.
32473600, However, based on experience from the use of other antiviral agents to treat similar virusses, some treatment options have been tried with some efficacy.
32473600, Clinical trials for future therapies are still ongoing.
32473600, In the meantime, prevention, control, active communication and investment in research are the only ways to overcome this challenge.
32473600, These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety.
32473600, These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks.
32473600, Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
32473600, At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were still hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.
32473600, Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

32473600, The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms.The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild.
32473600, Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease.
32473600, The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms.
32473600, This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.
32473600, In conclusion, owing to its safety profile, capacity to restore oxygenation, downregulate cytokine storm, and reconstitute immunity, ExoFlo is a promising therapeutic candidate for severe COVID-19.
32473600, Future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine ExoFlo therapeutic potential.
32473600, This pandemic has led to public health policies including social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
32473600, We explore here the impact of this unique crisis on victims of elder mistreatment and people at risk of victimization.
32473600, The COVID-19 outbreak has also had a profound impact on the organizations from many sectors that typically respond to protect and serve victims of elder mistreatment.
32473600, We examine this impact and describe creative solutions developed by these organizations and initial lessons learned in New York City to help inform other communities facing this pandemic and provide guidance for future crises.
32473600, This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research.
32473600, Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) - a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellence - during the COVID-19 crisis.

32473600, Endocrinologists must supervise the fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. • Patients after pituitary surgery should only drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of postoperative SIAD.
32473600, They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. • Hyponatraemia is common in patients with pneumonia, but it is unclear if it is only a marker of disease severity or if its correction improves outcomes.
32473600, Its prevalence in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. • In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU most probably due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics.
32473600, Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high rate of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. • IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.
32473600, There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
32473600, Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life.
32473600, As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
32473600, Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients.
32473600, Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as 'One Community' working for 'One Health's.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, We then designed antivirus peptides by molecular dynamics simulation of the fusion core.
32473600, The binding energy of HR2-based antiviral peptide to HR1 was -43.0kCal/mol, which was stronger than the natural stage of the fusion core, suggesting that the predicted antiviral peptide can competitively bind with HR1 to prevent forming of the fusion core.
32473600, The antiviral peptides can prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of infections.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality.
32473600, Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software.The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
32473600, The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P < 0.001).Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32473600, The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection.The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.
32473600, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children.
32473600, The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.
32473600, The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.
32473600, The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32473600, This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32473600, Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.Prognostic Level IV.
32473600, See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32473600,Hip fractures in the elderly account for more than half of osteoporotic fractures and represent a substantial economic and social burden.
32473600, Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which began to spread in December 2019, has created challenges in the management of elderly hip fracture patients, not only by influencing the choice of operation and postoperative rehabilitation methods, but also by generating new risks for the medical staff.
32473600, During this period, our infection and orthopedic treatment unit in the center of the epidemic area effectively treated 82 elderly patients with hip fracture, and no cross-infection occurred.
32473600, Therefore, our experience in prevention and treatment is worth recommending to frontline anti-epidemic personnel.
32473600, Minimally invasive CRC surgery combined with a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery should be recommended.
32473600, We also focus on mental health treatments and healthy lifestyle education.
32473600, In addition, routine follow-up can be moderately delayed.
32473600, In total, adequate doctor-patient communication is also recommended throughout the treatment.
32473600, His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms.
32473600, However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient.
32473600, Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues.
32473600, Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3).
32473600, Only one of the most severely ill patients scored ≥ 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission.Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms.
32473600, A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness.
32473600, A NEWS2 score of ≥ 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score ≥ 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.
32473600, There have already been examples of self-medication and overdose.
32473600, Clearly, there is a need to further define the efficacy of treatments used in the management of COVID-19.
32473600, This evidence needs to be backed by large randomised-controlled clinical trials.
32473600, In the meantime, there will no doubt be further off-label use of these medications by patients and practitioners and possibly related toxicity.© 2020 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine.
32473600, Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous.
32473600, Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow.
32473600, Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas.

32473600, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitor (tocilizumab) had been suggested for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients based on the concept of "cytokine storm" in COVID-19.
32473600, However, we still lack reliable studies to verify "cytokine storm" in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32473600, Furthermore, IL-6 inhibitor has potential hazards of inducing infectious diseases.
32473600, The efficacy of IL-6 monoclonal antibody-directed therapy remains to be fully evaluated.
32473600, Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies.
32473600, The animal models are important for both the fundamental research and drug discovery of coronavirus.
32473600, This review aims to summarize the animal models currently available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their potential use for the study of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, We will discuss the benefits and caveats of these animal models and present critical findings that might guide the fundamental studies and urgent treatment of SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.
32473600, Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses.
32473600, There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among these, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples.
32473600, This article aims to provide an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of nanoparticles as diagnostic or antiviral tools against coronaviruses.
32473600, The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors in this field are also presented.
32473600, Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started.
32473600, Because of a lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated.
32473600, The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home.

32473600, As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered.
32473600, Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate.
32473600, An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.

32473600, It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW).
32473600, Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW.
32473600, Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout.
32473600, The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.Copyright © 2020, Shah et al.
32473600, She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
32473600, Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults.
32473600, The patient likely contracted the virus from her parents, who because of the fear of social stigma hide recent history of respiratory illness.
32473600, These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Mansour et al.
32473600, The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet.
32473600, Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge.

32473600, Currently, management of patients with pancreatic cancer has been complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Medical oncologists face the dilemma of whether to treat or to not treat these patients who are at high-risk of complications and even death from COVID-19.
32473600, No current guidelines are available and our limited experience at this time makes it more difficult to manage these patients.
32473600, Although we have general strategies available from experience in Italy, we need more treatment specific strategies to help mitigate risks of complications and toxicities from chemotherapy in order to protect our patients from COVID-19 as much as possible.
32473600, Three immunizations using two different doses (3 μg or 6 μg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.

32473600, Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation.
32473600, A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far.For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality.
32473600, Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety.
32473600, The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.
32473600, A total of 414 of the team members, whose core members were from Guizhou Medical University and its Affiliated Hospital, took over the full operation of Leishan hospital of E'zhou, a makeshift hospital built for treating COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Under the instructions by the E'zhou Medical Team Front Command, the staff made quick responses to the surging number of patients with COVID-19 and rapidly formulated treatment plans based on the local conditions.
32473600, The medical team efficiently carried out the operations and successfully completed the rescue mission.
32473600, Herein the authors, as members of Guizhou Medical Team supporting COVID-19 containment in E'zhou, analyze and summarize the experiences of Guizhou Medical Team with the organization, implementation and logistic support of medical rescue operations, which may provide reference for future rescue missions in a similar scenario.
32473600, The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures.
32473600, The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies.
32473600, Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks.
32473600, We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.
32473600, Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea.
32473600, Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments.
32473600, Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (P < 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (P < 0.05).
32473600, The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05).MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.
32473600, A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death.
32473600, The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak.
32473600, In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system.
32473600, These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.
32473600, To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation.
32473600, For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients.
32473600, During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis.
32473600, In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.
32473600, Wearing the protective equipment (masks, goggles, and protective screens) with a poor breathability for a long time causes various skin problems, such as allergies, excessive skin hydration, local mechanical injuries, and even secondary infections.
32473600, In addition, in a closed environment, compression and friction aggravate skin reactions, which may compromise duty performance of the medical staff.
32473600, It is therefore essential to provide timely treatment opinions and prevention methods for common skin problems.
32473600, We also give suggestions concerning the preparation of medical kit for skin protection in the epidemic area.
32473600, Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients.
32473600, In this review, we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with COVID-19, which should help reducing morbidity and mortality.
32473600, In this era, we suggest 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 based on the immunological point of view.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications.
32473600, Within our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01-1.21%), comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% (0.20-0.21%), p = .597].Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option.
32473600, However, right data on the effectiveness of different immunomodulating drugs are scarce.
32473600, Herein, we discuss the pathogenesis and the possible role played by drugs such as: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL-1, calcineurin and JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, heparins, angiotensin-converting enzyme agonists and statins in severe COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease.
32473600, The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs.
32473600, Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction.
32473600, Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.Copyright © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris.

32473600, People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns.
32473600, Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses.
32473600, Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids.
32473600, Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is indicated is important.
32473600, The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure.
32473600, Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important.
32473600, The effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients were uncertain.
32473600, We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.
32473600,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is to date affecting more than a million of patients and is challenging healthcare professionals around the world.
32473600, Coronavirus disease 2019 may present with a wide range of clinical spectrum and severity, including severe interstitial pneumonia with high prevalence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care admission.
32473600, There has been increasing sharing experience regarding the patient's clinical features over the last weeks which has underlined the need for general guidance on treatment strategies.
32473600, We summarise the evidence existing in the literature of oxygen and positive pressure treatments in patients at different stages of respiratory failure and over the course of the disease, including environment and ethical issues related to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 infection.
32473600,Hospitals play a critical role in providing communities with essential medical care during all types of disaster.
32473600, Depending on their scope and nature, disasters can lead to a rapidly increasing service demand that can overwhelm the functional capacity and safety of hospitals and the healthcare system at large.
32473600, Planning during the community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is critical for maintaining healthcare services during our response.
32473600, This paper describes, besides general measures in times of a pandemic, also the necessary changes in the invasive diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with different entities of acute coronary syndromes including structural adaptations (networks, spokes and hub centres) and therapeutic adjustments.
32473600, Compared with the general population, they are more likely to be infected with the new coronavirus.
32473600, Among the infected cancer patients, lung cancer is the most common type.
32473600, It is necessary to provide more appropriate individualized treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer based on the epidemic situation of the patient's location and in combination with the patient's own condition.
32473600, Through active prevention of infection, timely conversion of treatment strategies, online and offline joint control, and positive psychological counseling, we do our best to help patients with lung cancer to survive this difficult period.
32473600, Acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV entering mammalian cells, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function.
32473600, Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment.
32473600, This review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications.Copyright © 2020.

32473600,The COVID-19 outbreak has led to wide-scale self-isolation, as a result of the quarantine period recommended by the World Health Organization.
32473600, Consequently, people's mental health, including their anxiety levels, may be becoming impaired.
32473600, To cope with the situation, the exergame appears to be an enjoyable easy-to-use tool for reducing social isolation, as well as an interesting mode of home-based exercise for tackling anxiety disorders and sedentary behavior.
32473600, This article critically appraises the opportunities and challenges exergames present for the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in a home-based environment during the COVID-19 quarantine period.

32473600, Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population.
32473600, The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued.
32473600, Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues.
32473600, The authors propose psychological interventions for prevention and treatment in order to mitigate the pandemic's psychological impacts.
32473600, Usual recommendations for management of asthma and COPD remain valid despite the ongoing epidemic.
32473600, However, lung function testing and nebulisers should be performed with caution during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a potential risk of virus aerosolisation and contagion during the procedure.
32473600, Particular care must be taken to identify and protect patients who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
32473600, Asthma and COPD treatments should be pursued and adapted to ensure optimal control of the lung disease throughout the epidemic, thus reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 disease.
32473600, The clinical presentation of COVID-19 range from non-specific symptoms to adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32473600, Diagnosis is based on PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab and emergency treatment rely on oxygen therapy.
32473600, Patient's orientation (home, hospitalization, admission in intensive care unit) is a central aspect of emergency management.
32473600, The shift from a strategy of systematic recognition of potential cases to the one of epidemic mitigation required hospital emergency medicine services to implement crisis management measures, to guarantee admission and hospitalization capacity.
32473600,Since its emergence in December 2019, scientific knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved rapidly but, due to the complexity and novelty of this infection and its political and economic stakes, much remains to be clarified.
32473600, Thousands of studies have already been published and scientific research is constantly evolving.
32473600, In this multitude of information, we offer an update of the knowledge currently available.
32473600, A limitation of the propagation, the understanding of the functioning of the virus and its clinical manifestations, the administration of specific treatments, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are the basis of the fight against this germ, which is still little known today.

32473600,To summarize the current practice and potential strategy in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).PubMed, Web of Science were systematically searched using terms including "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" and "2019-nCoV". After removing duplicates, we then identified articles, letters and commentaries regarding diagnosing COVID-19.Here we summarized relatively mature diagnostic methods like nuclear acid test and computed tomography.
32473600, Besides, new aspects regarding these detection methods like suitable specimens for nuclear acid test, possible use of 18F-FDG PET/CT were also reported.
32473600, Especially, we also presented several novel techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 like lung ultrasound.Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) by National Health Commission is recommended to follow as it provides detailed diagnostic procedures using currently available tools.
32473600, We suggest clinicians further explore the saliva's utility as a specimen for nuclear acid test and the use of lung ultrasound.
32473600, Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms "2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test" were used.
32473600, As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
32473600, We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
32473600, All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
32473600, Many efforts have been applied to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and many scientific studies have been conducted in a short period of time.
32473600, Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32473600, Current researches on potentially effective treatment alternatives are discussed.
32473600, We hope this review can help medical workers and researchers around the world contain the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Recently, WHO has defined COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and considerable researches have focused on the identification and prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, As a result, accumulated publications successively reported their early findings, leading to the constant updating of information, which might make confusion for readers.
32473600, Therefore, this review summarized the current researches about the genomic evolution, variation of SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrated its viral structure for pathogenesis.
32473600, Meanwhile, we analyzed the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide recommendations for present clinical treatments and inspirations for potential therapy options.
32473600, As a matter of fact, low susceptibility and minor aggressivity have been highlighted in most cases.
32473600, There are currently no effective antiviral drugs treatment for the affected children.
32473600, No sufficient results have been reached by the use of interferon (IFN), lopinavir/ritonavir, orbidol, and oseltamivir in the treatment of the coronaviruses infection.
32473600, The aim of this short review is to highlight the differences existing between COVID-19 cases in adults and children.
32473600, We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro.
32473600, The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, People are currently using these drugs for malaria.
32473600, It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.
32473600, SARS-Cov-2 has a strong infection, and the mortality rate of severe patients after infection is high, but there is no effective treatment.
32473600, Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions, which can reduce the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, At the same time, MSCs can reduce the level of pulmonary fibrosis and enhance tissue injury repair.
32473600, In this short report, combined with the progress of preclinical and clinical research, we comment the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype).
32473600, Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia.
32473600, LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals.
32473600, This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries.© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology.
32473600, The list of topics covered is large: meteorology and air quality factors with correlation number of infections, sewage waters as a way to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, current hospital disinfection procedures and new eco-friendly technologies and list of drug therapies recommend waiting for the desired vaccine to come.
32473600, During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem.
32473600, The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19.
32473600, That being said I believe that this Opinion Paper can serve as multipurpose document, not only for scientists of different disciplines but for social media and citizens in general.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32473600, Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval.
32473600, This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting.
32473600, The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.
32473600, During this pandemic, it is recommended that patients with asthma continue taking all controller inhalers and other asthma medication as prescribed to prevent exacerbations and limit outpatient clinic and emergency room exposure.
32473600, Symptoms that may differentiate COVID-19 from asthma exacerbations caused by another trigger may include fever, fatigue, anorexia, or myalgias.

32473600, As the outbreak are continuing to evolve, several research activities have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and preventions of this novel coronavirus.
32473600, This review will be a summa of the key features of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the virus causing disease 2019 and the present epidemic situation worldwide up to April 20, 2020.

32473600, Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies.
32473600, Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection.
32473600, In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

32473600, To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment.
32473600, However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill.
32473600, While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use.
32473600, This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare.
32473600, Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data.
32473600, In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses.
32473600, An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, This can accelerate the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, hopefully, of future pandemics due to other emerging zoonotic RNA viruses.
32473600, Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies.
32473600, A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity.
32473600, Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.
32473600, In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
32473600, Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
32473600, Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
32473600, To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Performing a chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease.
32473600, The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc.
32473600, The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition.

32473600, Bioethicists are in pandemic mode, dusting off and revising triage plans.
32473600, Patients and potential patients are fearful-of the disease itself and of the amplification of health disparities and inequities.
32473600, There is so much to contemplate, but as I go through my cases, I worry about disability, about biases and racist stereotypes.

32473600, Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation.
32473600, Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15).This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity.
32473600, These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.
32473600, Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function.
32473600, A thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life.
32473600, Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients recover as completely as possible.©Lisa Mary Sheehy.

32473600, At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 °C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment.
32473600, Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles.
32473600, However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators.
32473600, Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.
32473600, Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease.
32473600, Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale.
32473600, Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm.
32473600, The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.
32473600, A questionnaire should be made for COVID-19.
32473600, In cancer cases requiring urgent treatment, radionuclide treatment (RNT) should be planned according to the COVID-19 test result.
32473600, If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.
32473600, Following imaging procedures, scanners and room surfaces should be cleaned by personnel with proper disinfection training.
32473600, While individual-level factors predictably contribute to disparate COVID-19 outcomes, systematic and structural factors have not yet been reported.
32473600, It stands to reason that implicit biases may fuel the racial disparity in COVID-19 outcomes.
32473600, To address this racial disparity, we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for African Americans, as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health-care system.© Adam J.

32473600, The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.
32473600, COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32473600, COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.

32473600, The purpose of this report is to describe the institutional patient experience and quantify the impact of treatment delays and interruptions over the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, We also quantify the incidence of COVID-19 positive patients on census and provide guidance on proactive institutional policies to mitigate patient risk.Copyright © 2020, Press et al.
32473600,The epidemiological emergency caused by CoV-2 (COVID-19) has changed priorities in breast cancer management.
32473600, In those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect, it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home, reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics, as well as avoiding surgeries.
32473600, In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries.
32473600, Accordingly, we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal-like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres, or even primary care.© the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.
32473600, CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32473600, The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections.
32473600, In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
32473600, We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19.
32473600, The present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19.
32473600, A few days later he was admitted to the University Hospital, Landspitali, due to worsening respiratory symptoms and severe fatigue.
32473600, A computed tomography scan of lthe lungs showed diffuse bilateral consolidations and ground glass changes.
32473600, He developed respiratory failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit where he received further treatment, including tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor inhibitor).
32473600, He subsequently showed clinical improvement and did not require endotracheal intubation.
32473600, From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19.There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64).
32473600, For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%).
32473600, The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs. 29.7%, p = .02).More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes.

32473600, In addition to major respiratory distress, characteristic neurological manifestations are also described, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may be an underestimated opportunistic pathogen of the brain.
32473600, Based on previous studies of neuroinvasive human respiratory coronaviruses, it is proposed that after physical contact with the nasal mucosa, laryngopharynx, trachea, lower respiratory tract, alveoli epithelium, or gastrointestinal mucosa, SARS-CoV-2 can induce intrinsic and innate immune responses in the host involving increased cytokine release, tissue damage, and high neurosusceptibility to COVID-19, especially in the hypoxic conditions caused by lung injury.
32473600, In some immune-compromised individuals, the virus may invade the brain through multiple routes, such as the vasculature and peripheral nerves.
32473600, Therefore, in addition to drug treatments, such as pharmaceuticals and traditional Chinese medicine, non-pharmaceutical precautions, including facemasks and hand hygiene, are critically important.
32473600, High-dose steroid treatment allowed neurological and respiratory recovery.
32473600, We speculated a delayed immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, The virus may lead to a SIRS-like immune disorder or play a role of infective trigger.
32473600, Prompt invasive treatment should be adopted to avoid hypoxic neurotoxicity and prevent CNS injuries.
32473600,The emergence of the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China has caused a worldwide epidemic of respiratory disease (COVID-19).
32473600, Vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking.
32473600, Here we report a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV) in cell culture.
32473600, This cross-neutralizing antibody targets a communal epitope on these viruses and may offer potential for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, A concern was raised regarding the safety of ibuprofen use because of its role in increasing ACE2 levels within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system.
32473600, ACE2 is the coreceptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and so, a potential increased risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and/or worsening of COVID-19 infection was feared with ibuprofen use.
32473600, However, available data from limited studies show administration of recombinant ACE2 improves lung damage caused by respiratory viruses, suggesting ibuprofen use may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease.
32473600, At this time, there is no supporting evidence to discourage the use of ibuprofen.
32473600, The number of severe cases has increased dramatically worldwide, while specific treatment options are scarce.
32473600, The main pathologic features of severe or critical COVID-19 were consistent with acute lung injure (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by cellular fibromyxoid exudates, extensive pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation.
32473600, Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can balance the inflammatory response and has been mentioned to be effective on ALI/ARDS from both infectious and noninfectious causes previously, presenting an important opportunity to be applied to COVID-19.
32473600, In this commentary, we summarize the clinical trials of MSCs treatments on ALI/ARDS and raise MSCs as a hopefully alternative therapy for severe or critical COVID-19.
32473600, Health care providers must determine what procedures are considered "elective," balancing risk of treatment delays with that of coronavirus exposure to patient, family, and providers.
32473600, Given critical periods for language development and the long-term impact of auditory deprivation, some audiologic and otologic services should be considered essential.
32473600, In this article, we describe the experience of a quaternary referral pediatric hospital in Seattle, the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, and share strategies for risk minimization employed by Seattle Children's Hospital.
32473600, We hope that this work can be a reference for other centers continuing care for children who are deaf and hard of hearing during the COVID-19 and future resource-limiting crises.
32473600, In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management.
32473600, The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection.
32473600, In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department.
32473600, The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.
32473600, This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).
32473600, Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment.
32473600, Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared.
32473600, This overview will address several issues concerned with the COVID-19 pandemic that directly relate to dental practice in terms of prevention, treatment, and orofacial clinical manifestations.
32473600, Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-γ also represses the inflammatory process.
32473600, Similarly, the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia.
32473600, In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-γ, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-γ activation.
32473600, Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-γ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.
32473600, This virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus group, the same group of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Given the lack of registered clinical therapies or vaccines, many physicians and scientists are investigating previously used clinical drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
32473600, In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the CoVs origin, pathogenicity, and genomic structure, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Besides, we summarize the recently investigated drugs that constitute an option for COVID-19 treatment.
32473600, For patients with severe aortic stenosis, efforts to bring treatment to symptomatic patients amid this pandemic might lead to favored use of catheter based management using minimalist techniques that do not require these elements.
32473600, In this context, some patients with well tested surgical indications for valve replacement may be treated by catheter-based methods.
32473600, It is important that outcomes for these cases are followed closely both at respective sites and in national registries.
32473600, As we recover from this pandemic, surgical cases should once again be driven by multi-disciplinary discussion and clinical trial data, and not a mentality of crisis management.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, Also, interleukins (IL-6, IL-23α, IL-10, IL-7, IL-1α, IL-1β) and interferon (IFN-α2, IFN2, IFN-γ) have increased dramatically in MERS-Cov at 24 hours.
32473600, A similar cytokine profile showed the cytokine storm served a critical role in the infection process.
32473600, Subsequent investigation of 463 patients with COVID-19 disease revealed the decreased amount of total lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the severe type patients which indicated COVID-19 can impose hard blows on human lymphocyte resulting in lethal pneumonia.
32473600, Thus, taking control of changes in immune factors could be critical in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term.

32473600, To serve symptomatic patients who were already admitted to the hospital or in need of hospitalization while waiting for RT-PCR laboratory confirmation of infection, a COVID-19 surveillance zone was set up.A total of 301 patients were screened between March 6 and April 3, 2020.
32473600, Of these, 47 were hospitalized, 53 needed a differential diagnosis to continue with their cancer treatment, and 201 were about to undergo surgery.
32473600, RT-PCR was positive in 13 of 40 hospitalized patients (32%), 14 of 52 day hospital patients (27%), and 6 of 201 surgical patients (3%).Applying filters to protect our comprehensive cancer center from COVID-19 spread contributed to guaranteeing cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis in Milan.
32473600, A surveillance area and surgical triage allowed us to protect the hospital from as many as 33 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, We provide data on the potential covalent interaction of disulfiram and its metabolites with the substrate binding subsite of 3CLpro and propose a possible mechanism for the irreversible protease inactivation thought the reaction of the aforementioned compounds with the Cys145.
32473600, Although, captopril is shown to be a potential ligand of 3CLpro, it is not recommended anti-COVID-19 therapy, due to the fact that it can induce the expression of the viral cellular receptor such as, angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE-2, and thus, making the patient potentially more susceptible to infection.
32473600, On the other hand, disulfiram, an alcoholism-averting drug, has been previously proposed as an antimicrobial and anti-SARS and MERS agent, safe to use even at higher doses with low side effects, it is recommended to be tested for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32473600, He was receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for one month and 30 mg prednisolone for three months until his hospitalization.
32473600, Prednisolone was tapered to 15 mg when current COVID-19 was suspected, considering his recent cough, dyspnea, and fever.
32473600, Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved yet to treat infections with human coronaviruses.
32473600, As it will take years to develop new therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the current focus is on the repurposing of drugs that have been approved or are in development for other conditions.
32473600, Several clinical trials have already been conducted or are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of such drugs.
32473600, Here, we discuss the potential of these therapies for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.
32473600, Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus.
32473600, A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS.
32473600, Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure.

32473600, Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO2of <94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age >60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons.
32473600, Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes.
32473600, Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32473600, If found useful in managing initial SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.
32473600,The analysis of real-life data from hospital information systems could make possible to decide on the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 treatments by avoiding the pitfalls of preliminary studies and randomized clinical trials.

32473600, Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature.
32473600, Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.
32473600, The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, The lead therapeutic molecule was investigated through docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
32473600, In this, binding affinity of noscapines(23B)-protease of SARS-CoV-2 complex was evaluated through MD simulations at different temperatures.
32473600, Our research group has established that noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers; however, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and cough-suppressant.
32473600, This study suggests for the first time that noscapine exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral protein synthesis.
32473600, It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients.
32473600, IFN-α2b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection.
32473600, Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo.
32473600, The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.
32473600, The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age.
32473600, Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers.
32473600, While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings.
32473600, It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.
32473600, Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials.
32473600, Furthermore, dupilumab has been proved to be efficacious also in exacerbations of asthma, and it is known that viral infections can worsen asthma.
32473600, Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic.

32473600,COVID-19 threatens millions of lives, especially elderly population and people with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
32473600, Rapid and effective diagnoses are vital for the isolation of infected people and starting treatment immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus.
32473600, Bioinformatics techniques such as artificial intelligence should be used for collecting the hemogram and serum biochemistry data of all COVID-19- infected people worldwide, even they do not show severe symptoms.

32473600, With regard to the specific surgical procedures, nearly all primary TJA were cancelled (92.6%) as well as aseptic revisions (94.7%).
32473600, In most hospitals, periprosthetic fractures (87.2%), hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and septic revisions for acute infections (75.8%) were still being performed.During the current 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing a near-total shutdown of TJA.
32473600, A massive cutback was observed for primary TJA and revision TJA, even in massively failed TJA with collapse, dislocation, component failure or imminent dislocation.
32473600, Only life-threatening pathologies like periprosthetic fractures and acute septic TJA are currently undergoing surgical treatment.V.

32473600, This, some have argued, constitutes intellectual indolence, it is not scientific robustness.
32473600, Pandits foresee that the world will be different after the end of this pandemic.
32473600, Perhaps human ingenuity will seek new investigative methods that will render the randomised clinical trial obsolete, both, on methodological and ethical grounds.
32473600, Until then and even if we have to accept the scientific supremacy of the randomised study in the evaluation of novel therapies, the ethical considerations in the unprecedented circumstances of a relentless pandemic demand a more humane approach, befitting the beneficent precepts of the Hippocratic tradition.
32473600, Methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide were prescribed due to suspected glomerulonephritis.
32473600, After renal biopsy the diagnose was confirmed as crescentic proliferative glomerulonephritis.

32473600, He was discharged healthy without development of new pulmonary symptoms despite immunosuppressive treatment.
32473600, The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship.
32473600, Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission.
32473600, Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the "exposure time" to the "interaction time" (virus-cells).
32473600, This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period.The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired.
32473600, This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV.
32473600, Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available.
32473600, The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework.A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript.
32473600, The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function.
32473600, The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm.A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2.
32473600, The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations.
32473600, The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies.From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles.
32473600, Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents.
32473600, Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia.
32473600, Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
32473600, The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
32473600, Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Accordingly, the aim of this review is to examine in detail studies of convalescent plasma used during previous viral outbreaks and pandemics with particular focus on hemorrhagic fevers, influenza, and other coronaviruses.
32473600, The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population.
32473600, By the end, the authors hope to address the extent to which convalescent plasma represents a realistic therapeutic approach, or a distraction from other potentially useful treatments.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality.
32473600, TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05).In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option.
32473600, An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed.
32473600, Future controlled trials in patients with severe illness are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with IL-6 target therapy.

32473600,With the arrival of the coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States, care practice paradigms have drastically changed.
32473600, Data from China suggest that the new virus poses additional risks as case fatality of patients with cancer was higher at 5.6% compared to 2.3% of the general population.
32473600, There are three proposed major strategies to address care for patients with cancer in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with postponing treatment for those with stable cancer, increasing personal protection provisions for patients with cancer, and increasing monitoring if a patient becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, In this present commentary, we discuss the unique mental health challenges and burdens of patients with head and neck cancer in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and approaches to mitigate these stressors through telemedicine to reduce future burdens to the patient and the health care system.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, This longer-term strategy would provide a deeper pool of drug choices for future-proofing against acquired drug resistance.
32473600, Second, there will be further viral threats, which will inevitably evade existing vaccines.
32473600, This will require a coherent therapeutic strategy which pharmacology and pharmacologists are best placed to provide.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, The CXR score was significantly higher in males than in females only in groups aged 50 to 79 years.
32473600, A significant correlation was observed between the CXR score and age in both males and females.
32473600, Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older with coronavirus disease 2019 showed the highest CXR score (median ≥ 8).Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older showed the highest risk of developing severe lung disease.
32473600, Our results may help to identify the highest-risk patients and those who require specific treatment strategies.
32473600,The cystic features of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) found on computed tomography (CT) have not yet been reported in the published literature.
32473600, We report the cystic chest CT findings of 2 patients confirmed to have COVID-19-related pneumonia.A 38-year-old man and a 35-year-old man diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit.Chest CT findings showed multiple cysts in ground-glass opacities (bilaterally) with/without pneumothorax.
32473600, The cysts had a smooth inner wall.The patients continued to be given oxygen by mask and received antitussive, phlegm-dispelling treatment.At follow up, there was a reduction in the number of multiple cystic lesions on CT.
32473600, To date, 1 patient was discharged from hospital, while the other had been transferred to the rehabilitation department.COVID-19 may independently result in pulmonary cyst formation and pneumothorax; the application of a ventilator may be another causative factor.
32473600, Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality.
32473600, Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32473600, We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO.
32473600, Of note, this is a "living document," which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges.
32473600, Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases.
32473600, Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature.The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources.
32473600, Recommendations in this manuscript should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region.
32473600, It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve.
32473600, A total of 61 (28%) cancer patients died from COVID-19 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37% (20/54) for hematologic malignancies and 25% (41/164) for solid malignancies. 6/11 (55%) lung cancer patients died from COVID-19 disease.
32473600, Increased mortality was significantly associated with older age, multiple comorbidities, need for ICU support, and elevated levels of D-Dimers, LDH and lactate on multivariable analysis.
32473600, Age-adjusted CFRs in cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients at our institution and NYC reported a significant increase in case fatality for cancer patients.
32473600, These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.
32473600,While some risk factors have been identified, the reasons for the disparities in disease progression with COVID-19 are unclear, with some patients developing progressive and severe disease while in others the course is benign.
32473600, Given this sense of randomness, and in the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless.
32473600, It is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness, even without a 'magic bullet'. With evidence emerging that late presentation is directly associated with increased mortality, we make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention.© Royal College of Physicians 2020.

32473600, According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19.
32473600, The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person's vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis.
32473600, The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.
32473600, There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
32473600, EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19.
32473600, EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects.
32473600, More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production.
32473600, Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat.
32473600, The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine development.
32473600, As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported.
32473600, Using the epitope information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants which might cause drifts.
32473600, Among such variants, 23403A>G variant (p.D614G) in spike protein B-cell epitope is observed frequently in European countries, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France, but seldom observed in China.
32473600, Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
32473600, In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
32473600, Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32473600, Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
32473600, Surgeons were least likely to be concerned for their own health and safety and had the greatest concern for their resident trainees.This study highlights differences in the willingness of head and neck surgeons to delay surgery or alter plans during times when hospital resources are scarce and risk is high.

32473600, In both scenarios, the "fertility window" may be transitory; postponing diagnostic semen analysis and sperm banking in these men could compromise the prospects of biological parenthood.
32473600, Moreover, we provide recommendations on how to continue the provision of andrological services in a considered manner and a safe environment.

32473600, During the current pandemic, delaying surgery for even 1 or 2 months may lead to more extensive surgery or inoperability, where only supportive care can be provided.
32473600, Being semi-emergent in nature, treatment for these patients is currently on hold or delayed in most centers across the country.
32473600, This study was conducted to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and inability of the health system to treat HNC in a timely fashion and how surgeons are coping to this emergent situation.

32473600, Conclusion: ICU cases showed higher rates of organ failure and mortality than non-ICU cases.
32473600, The poor outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 indicated that more supervision is required in these patients. (Endocr Pract. 2020;26:xxx-xxx).
32473600, This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients.
32473600, Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications.
32473600, Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600, Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more.
32473600, The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]).
32473600, Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes.In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc.
32473600, Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.
32473600, CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up.
32473600, The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored.
32473600, Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19.
32473600, In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.
32473600, A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.Among 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.
32473600, A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.
32473600, There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.
32473600, None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.We found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.
32473600, Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP.We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP.
32473600, After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months.
32473600, Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes.In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP.
32473600, These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.
32473600,The aim of the article is to point out the important role of prevention and reduction of mental stress in the general population and in sensitive groups in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.This article includes the analysis and evaluation of studies and recommendations from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) that have examined the psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics on people and their impact on the further course.Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics.
32473600, Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread.
32473600, Hereby, strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, that include the suppression of fear, can trigger a vicious circle in which fear and suppression mutually reinforce each other.The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge to governments, health systems and people, with an uncertain outcome, which is associated with a significant burden of mental health in the population.
32473600, In line with WHO recommendations, national guidelines and preventive measures should include the psychological consequences, the acceptance and normalization of fears and the promotion of resilience in the population in dealing with COVID-19 in order to counteract a further spread.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

32473600, ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen have been suggested to exacerbate the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32473600, Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.
32473600, With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
32473600, Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.

32473600, Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system.It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient.
32473600, Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.
32473600, Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature.
32473600, Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.
32473600, At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students.

32473600, In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission (aOR 5.39; 95% CI:1.13-25.64).
32473600, Moreover, patients who required IMV, were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR 3.41; 95% CI:1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI=30-34.9 kg/m2) (aOR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.05-44.82) or severe obesity (BMI≥35 kg/m2) (aOR 9.99; 95% CI:1.39-71.69).In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission, while history of heart disease and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were independently associated with the use of IMV.

32473600, Conclusions Laboratory abnormalities and acute renal failure were common in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 infection in our center.
32473600, Admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation were common.
32473600, CONCLUSION.
32473600, We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.
32473600, With a death toll approaching that of China's SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert.
32473600, Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak.To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans.This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
32473600, The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms.This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission.
32473600, The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed.Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.© Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.
32473600, At present, the average length of ICU stay is 14 ± 9 days (mean ± standard deviation).
32473600, One patient has remained on ventilatory support for 31 days.
32473600, The evaluation revealed four key themes.
32473600, COVID-19 patients 1) had greatly increased C-reactive protein levels, 2) needed a significant inspiratory O2fraction, 3) were highly positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) dependent on ventilatory support and 4) suffered highly fluctuating respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support for a significantly longer period of time than non-COVID-19 patients.COVID-19 patients have characteristic reproducible laboratory findings and present a major challenge due to their illness severity and required treatment length.none.not relevant.Articles published in the DMJ are “open access”.

32473600, Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients.
32473600, Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician.
32473600, In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32473600, Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.
32473600, Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections.
32473600, Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease.
32473600, In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment.
32473600, After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment.
32473600, None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment.Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter.
32473600, This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.
32473600, According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays.
32473600, In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation.
32473600, Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement.
32473600, Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.
32473600, Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up.
32473600, In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool.
32473600, SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients.
32473600, In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Some reported challenges in accessing HIV testing, prevention and treatment services.
32473600, Compared to older MSM, those 15-24 years were more likely to report economic and service impacts.
32473600, While additional studies of COVID-19 epidemiology among MSM are needed, there is already evidence of emerging interruptions to HIV-related services.
32473600, Scalable remote solutions such as telehealth and mailed testing and prevention supplies may be urgently needed to avert increased HIV incidence among MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic era.
32473600, There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Until now, it is still unclear which drug can successfully fight against the disease.
32473600, Therefore, for the better safety of patients with COVID-19, further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all the potential drugs.
32473600, Such a measure requires action at the global level.
32473600, A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home.
32473600, Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453).
32473600, Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction.
32473600, Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).These findings highlighted the importance of primary prevention (home prevention) measures and could be used for references for individuals, health care providers, or health administrative department during the global pandemic of COVID-19.
32473600, Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly.
32473600, Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit.
32473600, Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic.
32473600, Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.
32473600, No obvious adverse reactions were observed.
32473600, All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab.
32473600, Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

32473600, For a better popularization of TCM, governments have made several advances in regulations and policies for treatment and measures of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32473600, Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like.
32473600, In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.
32473600, We would like to see these relevant studies, ranging from basic researches to clinical application, could provide some idea on effects of CHM to combat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses, and also offer new thinking for the exploration of therapeutic strategies under the guidance of TCM.
32473600, A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.
32473600, Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state.
32473600, Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity.
32473600, Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate.
32473600, If either agent is to be used, routine baseline ocular examination is not absolutely necessary.
32473600, Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity.
32473600, Both agents, however, have not yet been proven to be beneficial to COVID-19.
32473600, Radiographic technologies and tools, including Computed tomography (CT) and Chest X-ray (CXR), were applied for initial screening and follow-up, from which provides detail diagnosis with specific pathologic features for staging and treatment arrangement.
32473600, Although the radiographic imaging is found less sensitive, numerous CT-positive patients were not screened out by RT-PCR initially and later confirmed as COVID-19 positive.
32473600, Besides, the shortage of sampling kits and the longer turn-over time of PCR examinations in some areas were noticed due to logistic issues and healthcare burden.
32473600, In this review, we will discuss the challenges and the future perspectives of using radiographic modalities for COVID-19 diagnosis in view of securing human lives amid the crisis.
32473600, Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) did not decrease expression of either gene.
32473600, These findings differed from those for ICAM-1, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to gender, race, and use of ICS.Higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor COVID19 outcomes.
32473600, The lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with ICS use warrants prospective study of ICS use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased COVID19 morbidity.

32473600, Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure.
32473600, However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008).
32473600, Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.
32473600, Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.
32473600, The implemented crisis management stood upon three pillars : a crisis management team, steering documents and internal communication.
32473600, In this new form, the Department had already taken care of 442 COVID-19 admissions by April 16, 2020.
32473600, Alongside organizational challenges, clinical issues such as rapid respiratory distress, clinical suspicions with negative PCR and treatment uncertainties in the absence of sufficient evidence were overcome.
32473600, Despite the peak of the pandemic appearing to have passed, the next phase could be just as complicated.
32473600,The SARS-coronavirus 2 disease initially reported in December 2019 in China (COVID-19) represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, due to the high number of ICU admission and the prolonged stay for many patients.
32473600, Up to 5 % of COVID-19 infected patients develop severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment.
32473600, Apart from early antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment, the management of COVID-19 patients is mainly applying protective mechanical ventilation, to support the injured lungs.
32473600, However recently acquired data and clinical experience suggest that COVID-19-related ARDS presents some specificities that will be summarized in the present article.
32473600, Systemic corticosteroids have not shown benefit in viral infection, including other coronavirus; thus they should be avoided, unless prescribed for another indication.
32473600, The benefit-risk ratio is however clearly in favor of continuing inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma or COPD.
32473600, ACE inhibitors and sartans upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the pulmonary receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Any possible clinical impact of these treatments on COVID-19 infection remains to be clarified; in the meantime, they should be continued.
32473600, Consultations with patients with chronic diseases should ideally be done via telemedicine and treatments administered at home if possible.
32473600, The latter should be maintained in non-infected subjects to limit the risk of decompensation of their underlying disease.
32473600, In the event of proven infection, immunomodulatory or biological treatments will tend to be reduced or discontinued unless the disease is in a severely active phase.
32473600, Elective endoscopy should be postponed, and urgent procedures should be performed with appropriate personal protective equipment.
32473600, Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities.
32473600, However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations.
32473600, Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic.
32473600, In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
32473600, Other myeloid neoplasia and their therapies cause imunosupression; dose adjustment is recommended but no brisk stopping.
32473600, Sickle cell anemia patients are highly succeptible to severe COVID-19 course.
32473600, Thrombocytopenia and procoagulant state are associated with severe courses of COVID-19, requiring an individualized therapy.
32473600, No data indicate a risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood product transfusion.
32473600, This article compiles recommendations fr om cancer societies and expert opinions to provide guidance and practical solutions for the oncology clinic.
32473600, We propose that optimal standards of care be upheld, and short-term safety concerns due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 be weighed against a long-term compromise in cancer prognosis when deciding on adjustments in cancer care.
32473600, Proper mitigation strategies in the clinic and use of less resource-heavy but equivalent treatment alternatives often allow optimal cancer care.
32473600, The magnitude of benefit of cancer treatments needs to be systematically considered.
32473600, The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and associated disease (COVID-19) has alarmed the transplant community, since recommendations for adequate follow-up of organ transplant recipients during the acute phase of a pandemic are limited.
32473600, Furthermore, treatment options against COVID-19 disease and adequate adjustment of immunosuppression in at risk patients remain a concern.
32473600, This review summarizes current knowledge on the incidence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.
32473600, It also discusses therapeutic strategies and provides general recommendations on how to proceed with transplantation programs in a time when health care resources may become scarce.
32473600, It is only through widely-agreed protocols and teamwork that we will be able to deal with the evolving and complex implications of this new pandemic.

32473600, Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
32473600, Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
32473600, Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32473600, South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
32473600, For the dermatology community, this interruption to the healthcare system can lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.
32473600, Neglecting melanoma during this crisis can result in increased mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs.
32473600, With the COVID-19 pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, it is time for the prospective evaluation of teledermatology.
32473600, However, dermatologists should be cautious and continue seeing patients with pigmented lesions in person due to the necessity of early surgical intervention.
32473600,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has and continues to put huge pressure on intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.
32473600, Many patients with COVID-19 require some form of respiratory support and often have prolonged ICU stays, which results in a critical shortage of ICU beds.
32473600, It is therefore not always physically possible to treat all the patients who require intensive care, raising major ethical dilemmas related to which patients should benefit from the limited resources and which should not.
32473600, Here we consider some of the approaches to the acute shortages seen during this and other epidemics, including some guidelines for triaging ICU admissions and treatments.
32473600, Conclusions - In the largest reported cohort of COVID-19 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine {plus minus} azithromycin, no instances of TdP or arrhythmogenic death were reported.
32473600, Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy.
32473600, Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.
32473600,We describe clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 44 Caucasian patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at a single hospital in Pavia, Italy, from 21-28 February 2020, at the beginning of the outbreak in Europe.
32473600, Seventeen patients developed severe disease, two died.
32473600, After a median of 6 days, 14 patients were discharged from hospital.
32473600, Predictors of lower odds of discharge were age > 65 years, antiviral treatment and for severe disease, lactate dehydrogenase > 300 mg/dL.
32473600, The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
32473600, The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
32473600, In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
32473600, Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
32473600, Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design.
32473600, Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.
32473600, Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.
32473600, By the time you read this, that number will have increased significantly, and it is likely that we won't have seen the end of it by that time.
32473600, Policy makers in both the global north as well as the global south rose to the challenge, with decidedly mixed responses as well as decidedly mixed results, as comparisons between reported case loads of, say the UK and Germany or between Brazil and the PR of China, show.
32473600, Discipline specific responses translated into many global collaborative efforts aimed at developing treatments, modelling of the impact of varying policy options on the continuing pandemic, preventive vaccine trials, and so on and so forth.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, As of 8 March 2020, all patients have been discharged.
32473600, The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR: 4.0-9.0 days).
32473600, Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.

32473600, After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging.
32473600, Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance.
32473600, In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm.
32473600, In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.All rights reserved.
32473600,Across much of the world, cancer care has been sidelined to a variable degree by the global effort against the coronavirus pandemic.
32473600, This paper discusses the impact of coronavirus infection on cancer diagnosis and treatment in two leading cancer centres in Pakistan.
32473600, It also describes the effect that preparations for the expected surge in cases in Pakistan over the next few weeks have had on cancer care.
32473600, There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of delays in diagnosis and treatment on cancer stage and treatment, and to decide how to minimise these during likely future cycles of lockdown over the coming months and years.© the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.
32473600, In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively.
32473600, Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.
32473600, We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.Prognostic Level IV.

32473600, The immediate use of convalescent plasma provides prompt availability of a promising treatment while specific vaccines and treatments are evaluated and brought to scale.
32473600, Further development of improved convalescent plasma, vaccines and other therapeutics depends on quick generation of additional data on pathogenesis and immune response.

32473600, Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests.
32473600, Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients.Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan.
32473600, Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems.
32473600, Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.
32473600, So far, no causative therapy nor protective vaccines are available.
32473600, In several countries, the capacities for intensive care and for support in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are overstretched, and the mortality is considerable.

32473600, This article aims to provide an overview over the latest developments and insights that affect plastic and hand surgeons.
32473600, At the same time plastic and hand surgeons are required to participate actively in the discussion of new regulatory measures that on one hand aim to ensure a proper medical care of COVID-19 patients and on the other hand need to guarantee coverage of all other patients.
32473600, Furthermore exit - strategies after the pandemia need to be discussed by our societies.
32473600, Naturally, this manuscript provides insight into the current situation, which might undergo changes due to the swift progression of the pandemia.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, In the current manuscript we summarize the strategies, organisational approaches and actions of the Task-force Coronavirus at the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32473600, We also report on experiences with implementation of these approaches and treatment outcomes in the first 115 COVID patients.Retrospective, narrative process description and analysis of the time period between end of January and beginning of April 2020, performed by representatives of the involved departments and institutes.
32473600, Additionally a retrospective observational cohort study with descriptive analysis of epidemiological and clinical data of COVID patients admitted until March 31st was performed.A multidisciplinary Task-force Coronavirus initiated measures concerning outpatient testing and counseling, reorganisation and separation of patient flow processes alongside with substantial escalation of inpatient capacities on regular wards and intensive care units.
32473600, Within the framework of the resulting dynamic care model, 115 patients suffering from COVID could be treated without shortages in staff or bed capacities.In the upcoming pandemic, adequate COVID management and care could be secured by a collaborative approach with inclusion of administrative departments, clinical disciplines and theoretical institutes of the University Medical Center Freiburg.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, Over 100 years ago, the concept of individualised immunotherapy was introduced by Sir Almroth Wright and immortalised in GB Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma.
32473600, Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma explores the issues of private medical practice, equality of health care delivery, rationing of scarce resources (intensive care) and high-risk therapies.
32473600, The play also describes the dilemma of rationing of resources and selecting the correct patient for new experimental therapies.
32473600, Immunological theories of the time are now reflected in current understanding of inflammatory responses in sepsis and immunomodulation during the COVID19 pandemic.
32473600, The cut-off value of the counts of CD3+ (576), CD4+ (391) and CD8+ (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19.Our results shown that the decrease of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases.
32473600, The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

32473600, Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities.
32473600, TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors.
32473600, TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600,COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for global and national healthcare providers.
32473600, Number of new cases is continuously increasing with an emerging trend showing worse prognosis in males in comparison to females.
32473600, Based on this observation, our proposed hypothesis is that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, that are commonly used for BPH treatment, may be one of the factors contributing to poorer prognosis in males.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, While the clinical status, in particular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the need for their admittance to ICUs, several laboratory parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity.
32473600, Clinicians should consider low lymphocyte count as well as the serum levels of CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, cardiac troponin and IL-6, which may be used in risk stratification to predict severe and fatal COVID-19 in hospitalised patients.
32473600, It is more likely that the course of the disease will be unfavourable if some or all of these parameters are altered.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32473600, Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking.
32473600, We report two cases of patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated by CRS and were treated with tocilizumab.
32473600, Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
32473600, These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.Published by Elsevier Inc.
32473600, A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions.
32473600, We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis.
32473600, Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities.
32473600, Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials.
32473600, At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov.
32473600, Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020.Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro.
32473600, There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.
32473600, Therefore, their management requires multidisciplinary consensus and patient input.
32473600, A thorough geriatric assessment, which has been shown to be beneficial prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, could be particularly helpful in this patient population with the added dimension of COVID-19 risk.
32473600, In many cases, prudent treatment plan modification may allow for overall best outcomes.
32473600, Furthermore, recruitment of social services and, when appropriate, palliative care, may allow for optimal management of these patients.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, All contacts of three clusters have been isolated and no new confirmed cases have been identified to date.
32473600, Some measures which have reduced the spread of these three clusters included: First, high suspicion of COVID-19 for unexplained pneumonia is very important for early detection.
32473600, Second, immediate epidemic investigation is taken especially COVID-19 is infectious during the incubation period.
32473600, Third, when the second and third clusters could not find infectious sources, CECC's press conference let the public know immediately the epidemic situation, so that people could raise their awareness and seek medical treatment or quarantine.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

32473600,At first glance, the novel coronavirus pandemic and orthopaedic surgery appear separate entities.
32473600, Orthopaedic surgeons are not generally considered front-line staff in terms of the treatment of the disease that the novel coronavirus causes compared with anaesthetic and medical colleagues.
32473600, However, the impact that the novel coronavirus is likely to have on the musculoskeletal injury burden and the morbidity associated with chronic musculoskeletal disease is significant.
32473600, This article summarises the strategies currently being developed for the remodelling of orthopaedic services in the UK and the emergency British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma and Orthopaedic guidelines released on 24 March 2020 in managing urgent orthopaedic patients during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
32473600,During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, delaying lifesaving cancer surgeries must be done with extreme caution and thoughtfulness.
32473600, Modelling indicates that delays in high-risk cancer surgeries beyond 6 weeks could affect long-term outcomes for thousands of Canadians.
32473600, Consequently, it is possible that postponing cancer surgery without consideration of its implications could cost more lives than can be saved by diverting all surgical resources to COVID-19.

32473600,Pulmonary complications and infections frequently affect patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
32473600, Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients.Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes.
32473600, Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks.Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population.
32473600, Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, The derived data has been discussed with expert paediatric radiation oncologists to derive a hierarchy of recommendations.The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis.
32473600, The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed.This review provides evidence-based treatment recommendations during unexpected shortage of paediatric radiotherapy facilities.

32473600, We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients.Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy.
32473600, In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications.

32473600, Practices in surgical oncology had to change in response to these resource limitations, triaging based on acuity, expected oncologic outcomes, availability of supportive resources, and safety of health care personnel.The MD Anderson Head and Neck Surgery Treatment Guidelines Consortium devised the following to provide guidance on triaging head and neck cancer (HNC) surgeries based on multidisciplinary consensus.
32473600, HNC subsites considered included aerodigestive tract mucosa, sinonasal, salivary, endocrine, cutaneous, and ocular.Each subsite is presented separately with disease-specific recommendations.
32473600, Options for alternative treatment modalities are provided if surgical treatment needs to be deferred.These guidelines are intended to help clinicians caring for patients with HNC appropriately allocate resources during a health care crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, We continue to advocate for individual consideration of cases in a multidisciplinary fashion based on individual patient circumstances and resource availability.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result.
32473600, Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03).
32473600, Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6 (14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation.Older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition.
32473600, Treatments of COVID-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed.
32473600, In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated.
32473600, At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms.The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management.
32473600, Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.
32473600, Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.
32473600, Many of these questions cannot yet be answered on an evidence-based basis and this does not make patient care easy.
32473600, The German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) hopes that these initial recommendations will provide support for specific issues in the care of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in view of the current threat posed by SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, In order to take advantage of the dynamic worldwide gain in knowledge for our patients, the recommendations will be updated regularly.
32473600, The updated versions of the recommendations are deposited on the homepage of the DGRh.
32473600, Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic.We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms.
32473600, We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines.
32473600, We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments.
32473600, Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.
32473600,People exposed to COVID-19 have a risk of developing disease, and health care workers are at risk at a time when they are badly needed during a health care crisis.
32473600, Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used as treatment and are being considered as prophylaxis.
32473600, Our patient developed COVID-19 while on hydroxychloroquine and although more work is needed, this calls into question the role of these medications as preventive therapy.© 2020 The Author(s).

32473600, Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.
32473600, On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present.
32473600, Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.
32473600, Compatibility of sample pre-treatment for viral neutralisation or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested.The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel demonstrated a comparable sensitivity to the WHO recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1000 copies/mL.
32473600, The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity at 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29).
32473600, No cross reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel.The QIAstat-SARS rapid multiplex-PCR panel provides a highly sensitive, robust and accurate assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2.

32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic presents many medical and social issues for older people.
32473600, Presented here is a range of information arising from related areas that have impact upon the safety and efficacy of drug therapy in the context of COVID-19.
32473600, Issues include pharmacy practice, clinical therapeutics, and possible new treatments for the virus.
32473600, More information will be published in coming issues of The Senior Care Pharmacist.
32473600, Preprint manuscripts and popular media articles provided background information and illustrative examples.Included manuscripts were identified via searches using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, while organizational guidelines and popular media articles were identified using Google search queries.
32473600, Practice guidelines were developed via consensus among all authors based on peer-reviewed manuscripts and national or international health care association guidelines.
32473600, Strict objective criteria for inclusion were not used due to the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and a paucity of rigorous empirical evidence.In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care must be judiciously allocated to treat the most severe conditions while minimizing the risk of long-term sequelae and ensuring patient, physician, and health care worker safety.The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short- and long-term impact on health care worldwide.
32473600, Although the full repercussions of this disease have yet to be realized, the outlined recommendations will guide otolaryngologists in the treatment of pediatric patients in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis.
32473600, Searches were performed of all terms in each group as well as combinations of terms between groups.
32473600, Searches and subsequent exclusion of articles were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses).
32473600, Additional articles were identified after relevant journals and guidelines from national organizations were reviewed.Patients with head and neck mucosal malignancy require continued treatment despite the current pandemic state.
32473600, Care must be taken at all stages of treatment to minimize the risk to patients and health care workers while maintaining focus on minimizing use of limited resources.Patient care plans should be guided by best available evidence to optimize outcomes while maintaining a safe environment in the setting of this pandemic.
32473600, Institutions are faced with the challenge of upholding the standard of care while maintaining safety for health care personnel and patients.
32473600, Due to the common performance of aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures in the upper respiratory tract, otolaryngologists are at uniquely high risk for potential infection.
32473600, When possible, alternative diagnostic and treatment strategies should be pursued.
32473600, For patients suspected of having functional laryngeal abnormalities, transcervical laryngeal ultrasound provides a rapid and noninvasive evaluation of vocal fold motion to inform decisions about safety of feeding, airway, and progression of care.
32473600, MNP library was screened by a hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches.
32473600, Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed this study to highlight some crucial aspects.
32473600, Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpr inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin.
32473600, As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.
32473600, For instance, the inflammation that is induced at the sites of infection could tie these viruses to each other in a relationship.
32473600, Another example, bovine herpesvirus 1, which is an important pathogen of cattle, can cause a severe respiratory infection; the same way in which SARS-CoV-2 affects humans.
32473600, Considering the current circumstances related to the COVID-19 crisis, this editorial paper, which belongs to the Special Issue "Recent Advances in Herpesviruses Research: What's in the Pipeline?" aims to draw attention to some natural anti-herpesvirus alkaloid compounds, which have recently been proven to have excellent inhibitory efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 replication.
32473600, Thus, this special focus is an attempt to hunt down various treatment options to combat COVID-19 based on repurposing drugs that are known to have multiple antiviral properties, including against herpesvirus.
32473600, Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension.
32473600, Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is required with more COVID-19 patients..
32473600, Conclusions: The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes.
32473600, The severe cases were mainly occurred in populations at high risk.
32473600, In the epidemic period, classified management of COVID-19 cases should be promoted according to needs for control and prevention of isolation and treatment for the purpose of rational allocation of medical resources.
32473600,Based on systematic review of the role of clinical treatment, disease control and scientific research, and combining with the problems exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic, suggestions were proposed to reform and improve the prevention and treatment system for major epidemics diseases in China.
32473600, In clinical treatment, it is necessary to enhance clinical staff's awareness of law-based reporting, capabilities of syndromic surveillance, the use of infectious diseases reporting systems, and to improve national or local monitoring platforms for emerging infectious diseases detection.
32473600, In terms of disease control, it is important to provide authorities to disease control departments through laws and regulations, improve the quantity and quality of related human resources, and strengthen the applied research and technical readiness targeted infections disease prevention, control and emergency preparedness.
32473600, As for scientific research in major epidemic response, it is essential to strengthen research projects guided by national requests, build research institutions that can "make a final decision", establish national and regional key laboratories, and strengthen strategic technical reserve for emergency disease control and treatment.
32473600, Conclusions: The epidemic cycle of COVID-19 in Hubei province proposed to be 60 days, which was about 1.76 times of the combination of the longest incubation period or isolation period (14 d) and the average hospitalization time of confirmed patients in Hubei province (20 d).
32473600, It suggested that the major anti-epidemic decisions made in China were effective.
32473600, Conclusions: The fitting degree of the models are good.
32473600, The LBS big data and effective distance model can be used to estimate the track, time and extent of epidemic spread to provide useful reference for early warning, prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.
32473600,We describe a 2 weeks corrected gestational age infant admitted in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated to Bordetella pertussis and Coronavirus infection.

32473600,With the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been suddenly confronted with the difficulty of treatment provision and continuation of clinical trials without face-to-face contact.
32473600, This predicament has resulted in the rapid adoption of telehealth methodologies.1 Clinicians and researchers focused on obesity management have an additional need-- a remote way to measure weight.
32473600, In this piece, we will describe electronic scales (e-scales) and provide guidance on how clinicians/researchers might best implement e-scales in their clinical practice or research studies to remotely measure weight.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, An elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in eight cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection.
32473600, Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases: of these, 7/19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and 4/19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit.
32473600, Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the postpartum period: their newborns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection.
32473600, In one case, a newborn had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery.Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.This study suggests that vaginal delivery may be associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.© 2020 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
32473600,The Italian National Health System is currently living through some catastrophic days, owing to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the country.
32473600, At the time of writing, our Government has passed emergency laws (March 11, 2020), with a view to preventing widespread viral infection among the population, which may well lead to an increase in the number of people requiring intensive care unit (ICU) hospital treatment.
32473600, Currently, most of the northern Italian regions are close to saturation point in terms of the number of available ICU inpatient beds.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Treatment for other viral infections in renal transplant recipients often includes a reduction in immunosuppression; however, no current guidelines are available recommending the optimal approach to managing immunosuppression in the patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, It is currently advised to avoid corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 outside of critically ill patients.
32473600, Recently published cases describing inpatient care of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients differ widely in disease severity, time from transplantation, baseline immunosuppressive therapy, and the modifications made to immunosuppression during COVID-19 treatment.
32473600, This review summarizes and compares inpatient immunosuppressant management strategies of recently published reports in the renal transplant population infected with SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the limitations of corticosteroids in managing immunosuppression in this patient population.© 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.
32473600, We discuss how preventative and control measures implemented during the COVID-19 crisis could affect the prevalence of anaemia, and highlight issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients requiring elective or emergency surgery.
32473600, In addition, we review aspects related to patient blood management of critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and discuss important alterations of the coagulation system in patients hospitalised due to COVID-19.
32473600, Finally, we address special considerations pertaining to supply-demand and cost-benefit issues of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening.
32473600, Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation.
32473600, Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus.
32473600, This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.
32473600, Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40).
32473600, The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]).
32473600, Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
32473600, These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.

32473600, There is evidence that the current crisis is affecting the management of HNC patients.
32473600, Most healthcare systems have introduced remote consultations to decrease the risk of coronavirus infection to patients, carers and clinicians.
32473600, At present, HNC patients may be anxious and due to logistical issues, may not be adequately prepared for their treatment.
32473600, To ensure that patients have a thorough understanding of their treatment and expected outcome during the current COVID-19 crisis there may be merit in the use of the HaNC-AD PCI.
32473600, Contemporarily, Danser and associates [51] claim that there is no evidence to stop RAS blockers in the course of COVID-19 infection.
32473600, In fact, there are no available data which support that ACE inhibitors or ANG II type I receptor blockers increase COVID-19 infection via its binding to ACE2.
32473600, Finally, Kuster and associates [52] write that there are no data on the strict relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV2 mortality.
32473600, Moreover, in the SARSCoV2, cells expressing ACE2 were not attacked by the virus, while cells lacking ACE2 were bound by the SARS-CoV2 virus [53]. These findings suggest that also in the case of RES effects on COVID-19 infection, the dual role of ACE2 should be taken into serious consideration.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
32473600, Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
32473600, There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
32473600, The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19.
32473600, The compounds 2 and 3 may tightly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and so may be successful in the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600,The current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls urgently for effective therapies.
32473600, Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, However, there are public concerns and disputes about both the safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ for this new application.
32473600, Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse opinions on this urgent topic.
32473600, The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options.
32473600, However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.
32473600, With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Inactivation of ACE2 during virus fusion into the host cell may be one of the underlying reasons for intense immunological reaction seen in the lung tissue.
32473600, This overreaction is probably mediated through the bradykinin receptor activation.
32473600, Noscapine, a medication used for the treatment of cough, has been shown to inhibit bradykinin enhanced cough response in man.
32473600, As it is already marketed in a number of countries as a cough medicine, even for children, a suitable formulation with all the required licenses is available that can be rapidly utilized in preliminary trials.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes.
32473600, IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm.
32473600, Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials.
32473600, In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and "Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)" in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, The practices reviewed in this document must be taken in conjunction with local hospital procedures, multidisciplinary recommendations, and regional/national guidelines, as each community may have its unique needs, supplies, and protocols.
32473600, Importantly, as the pandemic evolves, so will the strategies and recommendations.
32473600, Given the unique circumstances for UM patients, along with indications of potential ophthalmologic transmission as a result of healthcare providers working in close proximity to patients and intrinsic infectious risk from eyelashes, tears and hair, practice strategies may be adapted to reduce the risk of viral transmission.
32473600, Certainly, providers and health care systems will continue to examine and provide as safe and effective care as possible for patients in the current environment.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.
32473600,This work shows a patent database for Coronaviruses that provides an overview of the patenting activity and trends in focused antiviral therapy with the use of triazole based compounds, glycoprotein, and protease inhibitors as possible treatment.

32473600, Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
32473600, In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv.
32473600, In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses.
32473600, Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.Copyright: © Journal of Biomedical Physics and Engineering.
32473600, The mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular involvement. Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical emergency which needs immediate coronary re-perfusion for better patient outcomes.
32473600, Here we present a patient who presented to the emergency room with acute STEMI and later tested positive for COVID-19.
32473600, She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, We need more research in Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular involvement for early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective treatment.Copyright © 2020, Siddamreddy et al.
32473600, The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
32473600, It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
32473600, Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
32473600, Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.Copyright © 2020, Pal et al.
32473600, First reported at the end of December 2019 as a cause for clusters of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city in China, the rapid spread of this condition was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32473600, Apart from the mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19, the massive social and financial havoc inflicted by this pandemic has left the entire world pondering if medical science can innovate and curtail the ongoing damage due to SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Recent findings of an open-label study that investigated the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 patients in Marseille, France, has garnered some optimism in scientific quarters and the general public alike in terms of finding a treatment regimen to control the rampant rise of COVID-19.
32473600, We will discuss the potential off-label therapy and studies as it pertains to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Sharma et al.
32473600, A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
32473600, Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs.
32473600, The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury.
32473600, As we await more data from treating these patients, this strategy is likely to help reduce potential complications.Copyright © 2020 Baylor University Medical Center.
32473600, SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats.
32473600, Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures.
32473600, This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.© 2020 The Author(s).

32473600,The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.
32473600, It has been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and the whole world is suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32473600, Currently, no treatment for SARS-CoV-2 are approved because of lack of evidence, but a number of clinical trials are in process and we are expecting fruitful results very soon.
32473600, This review focuses on various approaches of treatment and few of the most recent clinical trials carried out in this field.
32473600, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever.There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development.
32473600, Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective.
32473600, As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus.
32473600, This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP).
32473600, More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(4): 191-205].
32473600, Bootstrapping and logistic regression was used for inferential estimates.Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years.
32473600, Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality.
32473600, Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (p=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects >60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], p=0.004).ECMO may play an important role in critically ill patients with COVID-19 refractory to less invasive treatments.
32473600, The increased risk of early death in older patients may be used to prioritize ECMO indication in resource-conscious settings, if confirmed externally.
32473600, Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases.
32473600, So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID‑19 are limited.
32473600, Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists.
32473600, Thus, it is important to know typical COVID‑19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.
32473600, Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq™; 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively.
32473600, Videolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used.
32473600, Anaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group.
32473600, We conclude that standard and powered respirators do not significantly prolong simulated advanced intubation procedures.© 2020 Association of Anaesthetists.
32473600, Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment.
32473600, Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

32473600, Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-2.
32473600, We are facing a new virus, so several antiviral agents previously used to treat other coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS are being considered as the first potential candidates to treat COVID-19.
32473600, Thus, several agents have been used by the beginning of the current outbreak in China first and all over the word successively, as reported in several different guidelines and therapeutic recommendations.
32473600, At the same time, a great number of clinical trials have been launched to investigate the potential efficacy therapies for COVID-19 highlighting the urgent need to get as quickly as possible high-quality evidence.
32473600, Through PubMed, we explored the relevant articles published on treatment of COVID-19 and on trials ongoing up to April 15, 2020.
32473600, At present, the epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection has tended to be controlled in China, and it is still in a period of rapid rise in much of the world.
32473600, The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of coronavirus nucleic acids, but imaging has an important role in the detection of lung lesions, stratification, evaluation of treatment strategies, and differentiation of mixed infections.

32473600, Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over.
32473600, The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country.
32473600, Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic).
32473600, Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.
32473600, With accumulated experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently.
32473600, The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children. In the current version, diagnosis and treatement criteria have been optimized, and early identification of severe and critical cases is highlighted.
32473600, The early warning indicators for severe pediatric cases have been summarized which is utmost important for clinical practice.
32473600, This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.
32473600,As we know more about the clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, which is now accepted as a pandemic, many questions have been raised about how to manage and monitor the treatment of cancer patients.
32473600, It was determined that the incidence of lymphopenia increased in COVID-19 and there was a significant relationship between lymphopenia and mortality.
32473600, This can be thought of as an unresponsive problem in how to maintain anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32473600, This article was written for a hypothetical approach in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to be an idea of collecting data for treatment with anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32473600, Four decades into the HIV epidemic we have learned a considerable amount of information regarding social and behavioral approaches to addressing disease transmission.
32473600, Here we outline broad, scoping lessons learned from the HIV literature tailored to the nature of what we currently know about COVID-19.
32473600, We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research.
32473600, The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.
32473600, The fusion proteins are then characterized.
32473600, Both fusion proteins have a high binding affinity for the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit desirable pharmacological properties in mice.
32473600, Moreover, the fusion proteins neutralize virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in vitro.
32473600, As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they have potential applications in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation.
32473600, A task force performs home visits to infected individuals.
32473600, Persons under investigation (PUIs) can stay in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days or in special circumstances can be quarantined at home.
32473600, This community-based approach involved all stakeholders including local public health departments, public safety authorities, neighborhood councils, and community health centers.
32473600, Here we report a 37-year-old man with vertigo, fever, and diarrhea symptoms as the first manifestation.
32473600, F-FDG PET/CT spotted multiple ground glass opacity (GGO) lesions in the lungs, with increased tracer uptake in both lung GGOs and the whole colon.
32473600, Serial CT examinations showed the emersion and dissipation of lung GGOs.
32473600, We illustrate the symptoms initiation, the laboratory test results, the imaging examination, and the treatment strategy in the duration of COVID-19 with a timeline chart.
32473600, Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy.
32473600, In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition.
32473600, Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies.
32473600, Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.
32473600, The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future.
32473600, At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19.
32473600, The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies.
32473600, In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions.
32473600, It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability.
32473600, However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls.
32473600, It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation.
32473600, Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.
32473600,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurring during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery.
32473600, This case report describes successful treatment of preterm labor during acute COVID-19 infection.
32473600, Standard treatment for preterm labor may allow patients with acute COVID-19 infection to recover without the need for preterm delivery.
32473600, KEY POINTS: · Acute COVID-19 infection is associated with a high rate of preterm delivery.. · Standard treatment for preterm labor such as intravenous magnesium sulfate, antepartum steroid therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococcus infection were effective in this patient.. · In the absence of maternal or fetal compromise, acute COVID-19 infection is not an indication for early elective delivery..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.
32473600, Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options.
32473600, Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient.
32473600, Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare.
32473600, The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention.
32473600, A clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children is of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.© 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

32473600, Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed.
32473600, Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response.
32473600, The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method.

32473600, In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course.
32473600, The coexistence of viral RNA and viral specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARAS-CoV-2 from host's immune system.

32473600, Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection.
32473600, Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions.
32473600, Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice.

32473600, Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40).
32473600, The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]).
32473600, Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
32473600, These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.
32473600, These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020.
32473600, Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.
32473600, Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations.
32473600, This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.
32473600,With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment.
32473600, Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment.
32473600, The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response.
32473600, Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.
32473600, One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open access medicine is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).
32473600, Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness, pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide, should be considered for COVID-19.
32473600, Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent.
32473600, While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.
32473600, In this study, we discuss consensus recommendations pertaining to care of SMA patients during the pandemic.
32473600, We highlight that SMA treatments should not be perceived as elective.
32473600, Decisions regarding the delay of treatments should be made with consideration of the potential risks of COVID-19 exposure and the risk of that delay.
32473600, We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and healthcare provider, considering any geographic- or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, In this article, the authors discuss their consensus recommendations pertaining to care of these patients during the pandemic.
32473600, We address issues surrounding corticosteroid and exon-skipping treatments, cardiac medications, hydroxychloroquine use, emergency/respiratory care, rehabilitation management, and the conduct of clinical trials.
32473600, We highlight the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and health-care provider, considering any geographic or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.

32473600, All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab.
32473600, Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers.
32473600, Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.
32473600, Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.
32473600, Currently, no COVID-19 specific treatments have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA).
32473600, However, the current treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra®), and nitazoxanide.
32473600, In recent past, some natural herbal compounds have demonstrated encouraging anti-viral properties.
32473600, This article attempted to summarize available information on the reported anti-viral activity of some natural products.
32473600, However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
32473600, Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.
32473600, Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.
32473600,Concerns about the prevention and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as it is crucial in contagious epidemics that travel and transfer of the patients be minimal for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups.
32473600, Telemedicine or telehealth can play an important role, especially with previous successful experiences in the management of acute infectious respiratory epidemics such as SARS and MERS.
32473600, In order to better control the rapid spread of coronavirus and manage the COVID-19 crisis, both developed and developing countries can improve the efficiency of their health system by replacing a proportion of face-to-face clinical encounters with telehealth.
32473600, Recent technological advancement facilitates this reform, but there is a need for national or state-wide rules and regulations to be adapted accordingly.
32473600, The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I2  = 29.1%).
32473600, Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus.

32473600, Spike protein is a special structural protein on the surface of coronavirus.
32473600, It contains important information about the evolution of the virus and plays critical roles in the processes of cellular recognition and entry.
32473600, In the past decades, spike protein has always been one of the most important objects in research works on coronaviruses closely related to human life.
32473600, In this review we introduce these research works related to spike proteins, hoping it will provide reasonable ideas for the control of the current pandemic, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention & control, and others.
32473600, The literatures related to SARS-CoV-2 are emerging rapidly.
32473600, It is necessary to sort out and summarize the research topic in time, which has a good reference value for staff in different positions.
32473600, At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the judgment of the quality of literatures.
32473600, However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis.
32473600, In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial.

32473600, For each patient, C-trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization.Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC.
32473600, DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12.
32473600, On average, C-trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre-hospitalization period.DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels.
32473600, In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS-CoV-2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.© 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
32473600,The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is forcing neurologists to carry out a series of adaptations in the management of multiple sclerosis.
32473600, Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity.
32473600, Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist.The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context.After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.The neurologist should be aware of current evidence to assess the risk-benefit of starting, maintaining and stopping disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.
32473600, When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic.
32473600, Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc.
32473600, Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus.
32473600, However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.
32473600, These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms.
32473600, Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible.
32473600, In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring.Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need.
32473600, The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.
32473600, This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors.
32473600, The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
32473600, The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects.
32473600, This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics.Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.

32473600, The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision.A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension.
32473600, It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.
32473600, Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center.

32473600,The coronavirus outbreak was labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020.
32473600, Patients who require spine surgery should receive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening to prevent nosocomial cross-infection before surgery.
32473600, However, spine fracture and spinal injury are critical and serious, and there are no standard protocols for management.
32473600, This article aims to propose a treatment algorithm for the management of traumatic spine fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19.
32473600, In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection.
32473600, Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration.
32473600, We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT.
32473600, The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis.
32473600, To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.
32473600,Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents, the oral cavity is directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations.
32473600, Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission.
32473600, If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.
32473600, We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of βCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.
32473600, While great resources are understandably being dedicated to treatment and diagnosis, more efforts could be dedicated to limit the virus spread.
32473600, Increasing the efficacy of personal protection equipment, developing synergistic antiviral coatings, are only two of the cases discussed.
32473600, This is not the first nor the last pandemic: our nanomaterials community may offer several technological solutions to challenge the ongoing and future global health emergencies.
32473600, Readers' feedback and suggestions are warmly encouraged.
32473600, However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%. The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups.
32473600, Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world.
32473600, Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.
32473600, A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.
32473600, While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy.
32473600, Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Given that several currently marketed drugs may be efficient therapeutic agents for severe COVID-19 cases, they may be beneficial for future viral pandemics and other infections caused by RNA viruses when standard treatments are unavailable.
32473600, Leaves' water-alcohol extracts exhibited maximum antiviral activity on human coronavirus, while stem bark and leaves' water and water-alcohol extracts were the most effective on picornaviruses. (4) Conclusions: The analysis of the antiviral activities of Morus spp. offer promising applications in antiviral strategies.
32473600, New Zealand needs a viable strategy to protect its populace until a vaccine is developed and in wide use.
32473600, Until that time, it makes sense to protect the population by putting in place treatments that will be safe and effective, such as the use of convalescent sera and the use of direct-acting anti-virals.
32473600, These treatments should be sourced externally or made locally, but steps in this direction must now begin as the lockdown ends.
32473600, New Zealand has the scientists, the facilities and the will to make this happen, but the support of the government and the population will be needed if this plan is to succeed.
32473600, Balancing the benefit from standard evidence-based treatments with the risks posed by COVID-19 to patients, healthcare workers and to the population at large is difficult due to incomplete and rapidly changing information.
32473600, In this article, we use management of acute coronary syndromes as a case study to show how these competing risks and benefits can be resolved, albeit incompletely.
32473600, While the risks due to COVID-19 in patients with acute coronary syndromes is unclear, the benefits of standard management are well established in this condition.
32473600, As an aid to decision making, we recommend systematic estimation of the risks and benefits for management of any condition where there is likely to be an increase in non-COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity due to changes in routine care.
32473600, Availability of subcutaneous infusion pumps is essential.

32473600, Sadly, post-mortem protocols, in spite of their importance, are also underrepresented in the international literature.
32473600, A further problem, wich makes adoptability difficult, is that available foreign guidelines and algorithms are optimized for different legislation, and organisations, resources not available in our country.
32473600, In this article, besides providing a summary of literature, we would also like to make practical recommendations which may increase the safety of healthcare providers participating in the treatment or pathological duties with COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.

32473600, There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization.
32473600, Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60-6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02-4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients.
32473600, Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period.
32473600, Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in the clinic.© 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2020 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.
32473600, In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19.
32473600, We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources.
32473600, Premarin can exert similar ER upregulative and gene repairing power like endogenous estrogen without any risk for adverse reactions.
32473600, Premarin is capable of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, In recent years, CytoSorb-haemoperfusion to remove cytokines has shown promising results in the treatment of septic shock.
32473600, Inhalational nitric oxide (iNO), inhalational epoprostenol and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are options in severe hypoxemia that is unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation.
32473600, Renal failure is a frequent component of the multi-organ failure usually seen with disease progression and necessitates starting one of the available continuous renal replacement modalities.

32473600, Intubation is an aerosol-generating process and thus carries the risk of contamination.
32473600, Additionally the airway management of this patient population is usually difficult.
32473600, The goal of this article is to give a practice-based overview of the peculiarities of airway management in coronavirus-infected patients with special regard to infection control and patient safety considerations.

32473600, Not only because some patients require intensive care, but because patients with any form of the disease may need surgical intervention.
32473600, Managing these cases is a major challenge for anesthesiologists.
32473600, The purpose of this summary is to present the practical aspects of anesthetic and perioperative care for patients requiring surgical treatment.

32473600, Here we discuss the drugs most investigated for the treatment of the disease.
32473600, All the listed therapies are experimental at this stage.
32473600, However, due to the severe healthcare effects of the pandemic and the potentially fatal outcome of COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care units, their off-label use should none-the-less be considered.

32473600, In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality.
32473600, The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care.
32473600, It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries.

32473600, These challenges are the most critical in the field of intensive treatment and anesthesiology.
32473600, One of the most important prerequisites of effective critical care treatment is preserving the involved healthcare workers from the infection, by providing them with detailed practical advices on the preventive measures and treatment strategies.
32473600, The aim of the present review is to summarize the most important related knowledge available from previous experiences.

32473600, Chloroquine has side effects (nausea, QT prolongation) and there are several drug interactions.
32473600, The treatment should be reconsidered in the event of side effects and when inferior medication for comorbidity must be prescribed because of possible interactions.
32473600, Lopinavir/ritonavir is not effective.
32473600, Supportive care is at present the mainstay of the treatment.
32473600, A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples.
32473600, We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
32473600, One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR.
32473600, Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.
32473600, Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses.
32473600, Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations.
32473600, Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts.
32473600, Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.
32473600, In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise.
32473600, Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly.
32473600, For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times.
32473600, If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, Inside the hospital, new isolation capacities in the emergency room and a dedicated COVID-19 ward were set up.
32473600, The patient flow was reorganized using flow diagrams for both the outpatient and inpatient areas.
32473600, The general and special emergency management was optimized for the efficient treatment of COVID-19-positive patients and the staff were trained in the use of protective equipment.
32473600, This report of our experience is intended to support other emergency departments in their preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Therefore, alternative approaches are required.
32473600, Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C (Vit-C) has emerged as one of the other alternatives for this purpose.
32473600, Here we review the effects of IV Vit-C on the immune system response, the antiviral properties of IV Vit-C, and finally the antioxidant properties of IV Vit-C to specifically address the cytokines' storm characteristic of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that occur in the later cycle of the Covid19 infectious disease.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32473600, A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use.
32473600, Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms.Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing "cytokine storm syndrome" and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Clinical trials are currently underway.
32473600, In vitro tests are also being conducted to assess the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of this epidemic, which is considered a pandemic by the WHO.
32473600, We note that the content of this review is dated.

32473600, To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc.
32473600, No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet.
32473600, However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.
32473600, In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32473600, Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings.
32473600, Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.
32473600, Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.© 2020 The Author(s).
32473600, Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA ≥ 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17-23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score < 17).
32473600, Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition.A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group.
32473600, There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups.
32473600, Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition.The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.
32473600, We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine.
32473600, Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited.
32473600, There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.
32473600, Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy.
32473600, Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β).
32473600, This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response.
32473600, In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 involves inhibition of host GSK3β.
32473600, In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age.
32473600, For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection.
32473600, Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients.
32473600, Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID-19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure.Pediatric rheumatologists are expected to play a supporting role in this new front of COVID-19 pandemic, both as general pediatricians treating infected children, and as rheumatologists taking care of their rheumatic patients, as well as offering their experience in the possible alternative use of immunomodulatory drugs.
32473600, The CT image is used to assess the disease progress, whereas the continued two times of negative results from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection had been considered as a criterion for ending antiviral treatment.
32473600, We compared the two COVID-19 cases with similar backgrounds and CT image repeated intervals under treatment.
32473600, Our report highlighted the unsynchronized expression in the changes of CT image and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19, and lasting positive nucleic acid test result in patients recovered from pneumonia.
32473600, It may be contributed to recognize the disease and improve prevention.
32473600, To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment.
32473600, Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified.
32473600, Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes.
32473600, It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.
32473600, There is no drug or vaccine for humanand animal coronavirus.The inhibition of 3CL hydrolase enzyme provides a promising therapeutic principle for developing treatments against CoViD-19.The 3CLpro (Mpro) known for involving in counteracting the host innate immune response.Thiswork presents the inhibitory effect of some natural compounds against 3CL hydrolase enzyme, and explain the main interactions in inhibitor-enzyme complex.

32473600, The report emphasizes on the clinical presentations of the disease and ventilatory support in pediatric patients with COVID-19.
32473600, It establishes a flowchart to guide health practitioners on triaging critical cases.
32473600, COVID-19 is essentially an unknown clinical condition for the majority of pediatric intensive care professionals.
32473600, Guidelines developed by experts can help all practitioners standardize their attitudes and improve the treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, In the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being a new virus, there are already drugs suggested as active in in vitro assays that are being repurposed in clinical trials.
32473600, Promising SARS-CoV-2 viral targets and computational approaches are described and discussed.

32473600, Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza.
32473600, SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes.
32473600, Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients.
32473600, Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression.
32473600, Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19.
32473600, We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.© 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2020 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.
32473600, As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient.
32473600, Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses.

32473600, Of the six remaining participants, five samples were tested weakly positive by the IgM ELISA.
32473600, Meanwhile, high titers of IgG were observed in five samples.
32473600, The patient treated with CP did not require mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion, and was then transferred to a general ward.Our serological findings in convalescent plasma from recovered patients may help facilitate understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish CP donor screening protocol in COVID-19 outbreak.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies including IgM and IgG were measured by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in convalescent plasma from six donors who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nanjing, China.
32473600, CP was also utilized for the treatment of one severe COVID-19 patient.
32473600, A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19.
32473600, Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19.As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs.

32473600, Emerging infectious diseases by their nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic-treatment-control nexus, and push our concepts of causality beyond the limits of the conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology.
32473600, We need to use contemporary methods of assessing causality to ensure that clinical, laboratory and public health measures draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation.
32473600, The purpose of any aetiological hypothesis is to derive actionable insights into this latest emerging infectious disease.
32473600, This review is an introduction to a conversation with medical microbiologists, which will be supported by a moderated blog.
32473600, Conclusion: The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment.
32473600, A comprehensive program should be taken in the future.
32473600, Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid.
32473600, Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32473600, In the absence of potential interventions for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to control the spread of this disease.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority.
32473600, Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4).
32473600, Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8).
32473600, However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.
32473600, The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status.
32473600, Consequently the first come-first served rule to ICU admission should not be applied.
32473600, The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life.
32473600, Finally particular attention should be paid to the bereavement management of the family/caregivers and in the right approach of psychological problems and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of health workers involved in the pandemia.
32473600, In the current context of international public health emergency caused by the CoViD-19 epidemic, this work aims to explain the ethical, deontological and legal bases of the SIAARTI Document and to propose methodologic and argumentative integrations that are useful for understanding and placing in context the decision-making criteria proposed.
32473600, The working group that contributed to the drafting of this paper agrees that it is appropriate that healthcare personnel, who is particularly committed to taking care of those who are currently in need of intensive or sub-intensive care, should benefit from clear operational indications that are useful to orient care and, at the same time, that the population should know in advance which criteria will guide the tragic choices that may fall on each one of us.
32473600, This contribution therefore firstly reflects on the appropriateness of the SIAARTI standpoint and the objectives of the SIAARTI Document.
32473600, It then turns to demonstrate how the recommendations it proposes can be framed within a shared interdisciplinary, ethical, deontological and legal perspective.
32473600, Without attempting to subtly induce the patient to believe that it is the best decision for him.
32473600, In the case of CoViD-19, we must rely on professionals: it is not the time for the anticipated treatment plan, for self-determination.
32473600, Of course, we can always say "no"; but we hope that as soon as possible we will be able to take back all the freedoms that has just been conquered: that of end-of-life choices, after a process of sharing with the carers.
32473600, But in this difficult moment someone can also feel a relief - that of the old paternalistic choices - that someone else decides for us.
32473600,A position statement published by the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) is fostering a vibrant debate, crossed by deep fears.
32473600, These are recommendations addressed to ICU doctors who must decide whether to implement intensive treatments for patients who need them to survive.
32473600, Specifically, the reference is to the patients to whom the CoViD-19 epidemic has compromised respiratory capacity.
32473600, We still do not have clear what positive criteria can help make clinical decisions in contexts of insufficient resources that force us to make choices.
32473600, Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation.
32473600, In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential.
32473600, Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important.
32473600, This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Most countries affected by COVID-19 have opted for nationwide confinement, which means that communication with the primary clinician is often performed by telemedicine.
32473600, Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines.
32473600, This statement of the EAACI Section on Pediatrics puts forward six recommendations for the management of childhood allergies and immunodeficiencies based on six underlying facts and existing evidence.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures.
32473600, This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons.
32473600, Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata.
32473600, If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.
32473600, While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome.
32473600, Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed.
32473600, COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality.
32473600, More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.
32473600, Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases.
32473600, Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors.There were more men than women among critically ill patients.
32473600, All of the cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography and the vast majority of patients displayed fever and dry cough.
32473600, The clinical laboratory indices change significantly, especially the D-dimer level among non-survivors.© Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.
32473600, Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators.
32473600, For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
32473600, Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
32473600, The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed.For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
32473600, It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
32473600, The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region.
32473600, Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.

32473600, Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition.
32473600, So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit.COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia.

32473600, Drug repurposing that has emerged as an effective drug discovery approach from earlier approved drugs could reduce the time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery.
32473600, Direct virus-targeted antiviral agents target specific nucleic acid or proteins of the virus while host-based antivirals target either the host innate immune responses or the cellular machineries that are crucial for viral infection.
32473600, Both the approaches necessarily interfere with viral pathogenesis.
32473600, Here we summarize the present status of both virus-based and host-based drug repurposing perspectives for coronaviruses in general and the SARS-CoV-2 in particular.
32473600, Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings.
32473600, Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
32473600, Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up.Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population.

32473600, Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization.
32473600, Countries who are successful at aggressive screening, early identification, patient isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and infection control methods should also address the risk of stigmatization among populations and the negative effects which could occur.
32473600, The cases of COVID-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections.
32473600, Timely and appropriate public health interventions addressing cultural impact and risk for stigmatization along with proper screening, treatment, and follow up for affected individuals and close contacts can reduce the number of infections, serious illness, and deaths.
32473600, The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human.
32473600, As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%. There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important.
32473600, In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures.
32473600, We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.
32473600, Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation.
32473600, During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
32473600, When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them.
32473600, At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.
32473600, Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
32473600, COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
32473600, Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
32473600, The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32473600, The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min).
32473600, The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min).Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor.
32473600, Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
32473600, To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.
32473600, Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response.
32473600, However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19.Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.

32473600, Results also revealed that young people aged 21-40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use.
32473600, To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses.
32473600, Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
32473600, The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway.

32473600,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used for the treatment of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases.
32473600, However, evidence of efficacy remains limited, and adverse events can be associated with its use.
32473600, Here, we report a case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who, after being administered HCQ, exhibited a 10-fold increase in serum levels of transaminases, followed by a rapid decrease after HCQ was withdrawn.
32473600, Considering the significantly increased use of HCQ during the COVID-19 pandemic, this case alerts us to the potential for HCQ to be associated with hepatotoxicity and the need to monitor liver function during HCQ therapy.
32473600, Further understanding the link between obesity and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, as this could aid proper tailoring of immunomodulatory treatments, together with improving stratification among those possibly requiring critical care.

32473600,The new coronavirus pandemic poses question and challenges for dermatologists.
32473600, One of question is if psoriasis patients treated with immunomodulating and immunosuppressive drugs have to discontinue their treatment in the midst of fears for the infection and its consequences.
32473600, One of the challenges is how can we support our patients in this critical time.

32473600, COVID-19 is a challenge for the treatment of dermatologic patients, either with severe inflammatory disorders or with skin cancer.
32473600, The consequences for systemic treatment are obvious but it will be most important to collect the clinical data for a better decision process.
32473600, Last but not least, education in dermatology for students will not be temporarily possible in the classical settings.

32473600, Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients.
32473600, Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out.
32473600, Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions.
32473600, Last but not least, logistics and manpower plans were drawn up in anticipation of resource demands and measures to improve the mental well-being of staff were implemented.We hope our measures during this COVID-19 pandemic can help ophthalmologists globally and serve to guide and maintain safe access in ophthalmology clinics when faced with similar disease outbreaks.
32473600, Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated.
32473600, The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine.
32473600, Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved.
32473600, Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications.
32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32473600, The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32473600, Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American College of Cardiology Foundation.
32473600, The disease is the cause of the 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak.

32473600, The present review article discusses the effects of biguanides on influenza and coronavirus.
32473600, Since Louis Pateur who developed a vaccine against rabies in 1885, in general a series of "specific" vaccines have been used for treatment of viral infection, mainly because antibiotics in general are ineffective for treatment of viral infection.
32473600, However, it takes 12-18 months till the effective vaccine becomes available.
32473600, Until then ventilator (O2 supplier) would be the most common tool for saving the life of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Thus, as alternative potentially more direct "broad-spectrum" COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available in the market, are introduced here.© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

32473600, Each hospital should be logistically prepared for the need to perform urgent surgery on a patient with suspected or confirmed infection, including personal protective equipment.
32473600, Limited availability of the equipment, working under pressure and staff shortages in addition to a highly contagious pathogen necessitate a pragmatic management of human resources in health care.
32473600, Instant synchronized action is needed, and clear uniform guidelines are essential for the healthcare system to provide citizens with the necessary surgical care while protecting both patients, and staff.

32473600,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in China and the epidemic is still going on at present.
32473600, Since children are the susceptible population, the number of cases is gradually increasing.
32473600, In addition to the typical respiratory symptoms, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also has the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular system damage.
32473600, Based on a literature review, this article discusses the possible cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children and related mechanisms, in order to provide help for the timely treatment and prevention of cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children.
32473600, As for clinical symptoms, 29 children (25.2%) had fever, 47 (40.9%) had respiratory symptoms (including cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and 61 (53.0%) were asymptomatic.
32473600, Lung CT findings showed ground glass opacity, fiber opacities, patchy changes, and pulmonary consolidation in 49 children (42.6%), among whom 2 children had "white lung"; 39 children (33.9%) only had lung texture enhancement and 27 children (23.5%) had no pulmonary imaging changes.
32473600, Among the 115 children, 3 were critically ill, among whom 1 had been cured and the other 2 were under continuous treatment.Most of the children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a close contact history.
32473600, Critical cases are rare and there is a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.
32473600, Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers.
32473600, However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis.
32473600, The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes.
32473600, Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.
32473600, For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment.
32473600, For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions.
32473600, Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation.
32473600, Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.
32473600, Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands.
32473600, While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications.
32473600, Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.
32473600, Not quite half of participants (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior 2 weeks.
32473600, Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications, including hydroxychloroquine.After 2 weeks, many participants with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their health care, with many altering medications without professional consultation or because of hydroxychloroquine shortage.
32473600, As evidence accumulates on the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 treatments, effort is needed to safeguard access to established treatments for rheumatic diseases.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, A total of five (n = 5) plasma and three (n = 3) platelet products were evaluated in this study.In both experiments, the measured titre of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light.
32473600, The mean log reductions in the viral titres were ≥3·40 and ≥4·53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively.Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titre of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture.

32473600, Immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange, for those treated outside of the home, expose patients to the hazards of hospital or outpatient infusion centers.
32473600, Steroid therapy initiation and continuation pose increased infectious risk.
32473600, Immunosuppressant therapy similarly becomes highly problematic, with the risks of treatment continuation enhanced by uncertainties regarding duration of the pandemic.
32473600, The required processes necessitate considerable time and effort especially as resources and staff are re-deployed to face the pandemic, but are essential for protecting this group of patients and as an integral part of wider public health actions.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital.
32473600, The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments.
32473600, Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.
32473600, A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.
32473600, Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.
32473600, The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
32473600, In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.
32473600, In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
32473600,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has infected nearly 3,582,233 individuals with 248,558 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
32473600, No antiviral therapies or vaccines are available for their treatment or prevention.
32473600, Passive immunization PI through broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind to the specific antigens of SARS-CoV 2 might be a potential solution to address the immediate health threat of COVID-19 pandemic while vaccines are being developed.
32473600, The PI approach in treating COVID-19 is discussed herein, including a summary of its historical applications to confront epidemics.
32473600,SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a pneumonia that was identified through fever, dyspnea, and acute respiratory symptoms and named COVID-19.
32473600, This disease exacerbates in a number of patients and causes pulmonary edema, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32473600, Prevalence of ARDS among COVID-19 patients has been reported to be up to 17%. Among the introduced treatment methods for management of ARDS patients, prone position can be used as an adjuvant therapy for improving ventilation in these patients.
32473600, Here we reviewed the literature regarding the role of prone position in management of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits.
32473600, Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19.
32473600, In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO).
32473600, In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.
32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32473600, The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32473600, Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

32473600, Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment.In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan.
32473600, Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people.

32473600, Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex).
32473600, Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes.
32473600, The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed.

32473600, Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases.
32473600, In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time.
32473600, However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped.
32473600, Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.
32473600, The medical picture will often be complicated by unique social characteristics.
32473600, The reliance on caregivers for activities of daily living can, as an example, increase the human resource requirement of an ED.
32473600, Considering the vulnerabilities and complexities of patients with SCI, the community should prioritise prevention of COVID-19 infections in this group.

32473600, For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID.From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering.Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID.
32473600, We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics.The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them.
32473600, We suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release.
32473600, Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair.
32473600, Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation.
32473600,Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originated from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, at the end of 2019, it has become a clinical threat to the general population worldwide.
32473600, Among people infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the intensive management of the critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) needs substantial medical resource.
32473600, In the present article, we have summarized the promising drugs, adjunctive agents, respiratory supportive strategies, as well as circulation management, multiple organ function monitoring and appropriate nutritional strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU based on the previous experience of treating other viral infections and influenza.
32473600, These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19.

32473600, BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).
32473600, Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in HLH patients (Valade et al., 2015).
32473600, OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HLH with neurological involvement to prevent serious complications and demise.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro.
32473600, The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation.

32473600, We found that approximately two-thirds of patients with these cancers do not require high-priority surgery.
32473600, Conversely, of patients requiring high-priority surgery, approximately one in four is considered at high perioperative risk.

32473600, To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19.
32473600, Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.
32473600, This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention.
32473600, The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.
32473600, Conclusion: Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low.
32473600, The compliance was excellent, significant improvements were observed after only 3 months of treatment, without adverse effects.
32473600, During follow-up, the COVID-19 pandemic address concern on the possible increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression.
32473600, In agreement with current Italian recommendations, risk and benefits profile was discussed with the patient's legal tutor and the decision to continue the treatment was taken.

32473600, Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate.
32473600, This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models.
32473600, Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction.
32473600, In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels.
32473600, With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice.While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.
32473600, Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed.
32473600, Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
32473600, Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.
32473600, However, community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary hospitals with Internet.
32473600, Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare system should promote emergence ehealth.
32473600, Tele-medical diagnosis and referral should be developed by local governments during COVID-19.
32473600, The application of "Internet+medical treatment" in community medical institutions and synergy among various institutions should be promoted.
32473600, Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19.
32473600, We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19.Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19.

32473600, Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis downregulation, increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection.
32473600, Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.
32473600, Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals.This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature.Management of drug-drug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician.
32473600, Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication.
32473600, Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight.With this article, the authors inform the clinician about the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with ISDs used in transplantation.
32473600, Recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are provided.
32473600, Severe complications have been reported to occur in 33% of patients with COVID-19 and include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, acute respiratory injury, septic shock, and severe pneumonia.
32473600, Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19 and many clinical trials are currently investigating potential medications to treat COVID-19.
32473600, The immunosuppressed status of some cancer patients (whether caused by the disease itself or the treatment) increases their risk of infection compared with the general population.
32473600, This short review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on a cancer patient and discuss management options and recommendation in addition to highlighting the currently available clinical guidelines and resources.

32473600, Critical cases had higher total severity score(>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(>-779HU) and full width at half maximum(>128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(≦50%) than ordinary/severe cases.
32473600, In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died.A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.
32473600, Through treatment targeting hyperinflammation, he recovered from critical COVID-19 respiratory failure and required only 160 hours of VV-ECMO support.
32473600, He was extubated 4 days after decannulation, had progressive renal recovery, and was discharged to home on hospital day 24.
32473600, Of note, repeat SARS-CoV-2 test was negative 21 days after his first positive test.
32473600, We present one of the first successful cases of VV-ECMO support to recovery of COVID-19 respiratory failure in North America.
32473600, Urgent joined research efforts regarding the SARS-COV-2 rapid tests, accurate diagnosis, especially early recognition, and effective treatment of life-threatening complications would be highly desirable for humanity and medical workforce all over the world that try to combat a current global pandemic threat.
32473600, Due to indirect complex effect, intensified COVID-19 therapies and multi-drug treatment, it is believed that some oral conditions could be aggravated by COVID-19 disease, particularly those with autoimmune aetiology, linked to compromised immune system or long-term pharmacotherapy.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

32473600, Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk.
32473600, Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended.
32473600, The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented.
32473600, In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole.
32473600, However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe.
32473600, Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases.
32473600, The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published.

32473600,The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 creates another health burden for people living with HIV (PLWH) who face multiple morbidities and may be at heightened risk for severe physical health illness from COVID-19.
32473600, Our abilities to address these morbidities in PLWH must be considered alongside the socially-produced burdens that both place this population at risk for COVID-19 and heighten the likelihood of adverse outcomes.
32473600, These burdens can affect the physical, emotional, and social well-being of PLWH and interfere with the delivery of effective healthcare and access to HIV treatment.
32473600, We posit that a syndemic framework can be used to conceptualize the potential impact of COVID-19 among PLWH to inform the development of health programming services.
32473600, During the observational period, none of 17 anesthesiologists were infected.
32473600, Although intubation improved SPO2, reduced PaCO2 and blood lactate, seven of 20 patients died within 7-days after tracheal intubation.
32473600, Non-survivors showed significantly lower SPO2 and higher PaCO2 and blood lactate compared to survivors.
32473600, For those who are anticipated to deteriorate severe pneumonia with poor prognosis, earlier respiratory support with tracheal intubation may be advised to improve outcome.
32473600, Although some encouraging outcomes have been reported, and these results have been received enthusiastically, we recommend careful and critical evaluation of current evidence only when all methods and data are available for peer review.

32473600, The rule is to limit as much as possible the number of patients in order to reduce the risks of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus for both patients and the caregivers, who are particularly exposed in ENT.
32473600, The aim is to minimize the risk of loss of opportunity for patients and to anticipate the increased number of cancer patients to be treated at the end of the pandemic, taking into account the degree of urgency, the difficulty of the surgery, the risk of contaminating the caregivers (tracheotomy) and the local situation (whether or not the hospital and intensive care departments are overstretched).Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

32473600, The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases.In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate).
32473600, There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care.This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

32473600, While we agree that this interim guidance addresses important considerations for monitoring the disease process, we believe that the proposed treatment strategy of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to treat severe COVID-19 coagulopathy is an unconvincing strategy.
32473600, Patients that are critically ill with COVID-19 have hallmark signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)(2), and as noted in the ISTH interim guidance and our own clinical practice, thrombosis is the overwhelming phenotype with rare bleeding complications.
32473600, We address this concern with the existing data on the severe hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 victims and advocate for consideration of systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin to prevent life threatening micro- and macrovascular thrombosis to mitigate their associated consequences, up to and including progression of respiratory and organ failure.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases.At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 μg/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933).
32473600, Fibrinogen levels were associated (R2  = .506, P = .003) with interleukin-6 values.
32473600, After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P = .001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P = .017), CS (P = .013), PCS (P = .035), and FCS (P = .038).The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease.

32473600, Antithrombin (n=11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n=11) was increased.The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state.
32473600, These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment.
32473600, Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage and optimal duration of prophylaxis.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600,As of March 30th, 2020 there were 161,807 total cases and 2,953 total deaths of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with the number of cases expected to rise.
32473600, Other than supportive care, there are no SARS-CoV-2 specific treatments available for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) or those admitted to the hospital.
32473600, In addition, there are no vaccines available to protect our at-risk healthcare workers.
32473600, The National Institutes of Health is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate for a potential vaccine and the recipients have started to receive the investigational vaccine.2 We present a brief overview of the potential prophylactic and treatment agents under investigation, some which could be initiated in the ED if proven effective.
32473600, The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed.
32473600, Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.
32473600, COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.
32473600, Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.
32473600, During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.

32473600, The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care appointed a task force to provide timely, consensus-based expert guidance for neuroanesthesiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, The aim of this document is to provide a focused overview of COVID-19 disease relevant to neuroanesthesia practice.
32473600, This consensus statement provides information on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, advice for neuroanesthesia clinical practice during emergent neurosurgery, interventional radiology (excluding endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke), transnasal neurosurgery, awake craniotomy and electroconvulsive therapy, as well as information about healthcare provider wellness.
32473600, Institutions and healthcare providers are encouraged to adapt these recommendations to best suit local needs, considering existing practice standards and resource availability to ensure safety of patients and providers.
32473600, In this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women, and discuss the current evidence of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and its potential consequences for assisted reproductive treatments.
32473600, Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks.
32473600, However, considering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles.
32473600, New evidence must be considered carefully in order to adjust these recommendations accordingly at any time and to guide assisted reproductive treatments.
32473600, It can also increase the number of people tested by 9-10 fold.
32473600, However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths.
32473600, These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant.

32473600, No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.

32473600, There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults.
32473600, There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases.
32473600, The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03).
32473600, Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
32473600, These similarities are explored here, and underscore the need to consider the role of basic biological mechanisms of aging on potential treatment and outcomes of COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600, However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted.
32473600, We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation.

32473600, A current pandemic is caused by novel corona virus originated from China.
32473600, COVID-19  pandemic  is  very  similar  to  Spanish,  Hong  Kong,  Asian  and  swine  influenza  pandemics  in  terms  of  spreading  to  world  by the mobilized people.
32473600, Burden of pandemic is considered in terms of disease transmissibility and the growth rate of epidemic and duration of pandemic can be calculated by transmissibility characteristic.

32473600, However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines “cytokine storm” leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain.
32473600, The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease.
32473600, In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

32473600, Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients.
32473600, The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings.
32473600, Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results.
32473600, Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient.
32473600, Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.
32473600, Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.
32473600, MTS was officially launched for 37 days, during which it has been used 3,061 times.Conclusions:The building of the MTS not only provides convenience and benefit for health care professionals, but also reduces person-to-person contact.
32473600, Conclusions POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount.
32473600, Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources.
32473600, Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience.
32473600, The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.
32473600, Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer.
32473600, Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.

32473600, Management of ACovCS should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists and cardiologists.
32473600, Priorities for managing ACovCS include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point where intervention may be most effective.
32473600, The aim of this paper is to review the best available data on ACovCS epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.
32473600, From these data, we propose a surveillance, diagnostic and management strategy that balances potential patient risks and healthcare staff exposure with improvement in meaningful clinical outcomes.
32473600, The BCRSS was rapidly developed in Brescia, Italy, during that nation's COVID-19 crisis.
32473600, The scale has not been validated or tested in other populations.
32473600, The BCRSS uses patient examination features along with the need for escalating levels of respiratory support (NIV, intubation, proning) to suggest treatment recommendations.
32473600, The scale simplifies the clinical summary of a patient's status, and allows clinicians to compare patients to one another and to track the trend of a patient's level of respiratory severity over time.
32473600, At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32473600, Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
32473600, Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
32473600, Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
32473600, There were significant positive correlations between CD4+ T and CD8+ T, IL-6 and IL-10 in the mild group (r2  = 0·694, r 2  = 0·633, respectively; P < 0·01).
32473600, After 'five-in-one' treatment, all patients were discharged with the exception of the four who died.
32473600, Higher survival rates occurred in the mild group and in those with IL-6 within normal values.
32473600, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, IL-6, IL-10 and PII can be used as indicators of disease evolution, and the PII can be used as an independent indicator for disease progression of COVID-19.© 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
32473600, In particular, several cases of recovered patients havebeen reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (which is widely used to treat humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir.
32473600, Inaddition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has alsoproven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxy-chloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies)were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects.
32473600, Since the recoveries/deathsratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experi-mental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitalsand rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this vi-rus.
32473600, This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to thedevelopment of other more specific antiviral strategies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
32473600,The development of COVID-19 syndrome in anticoagulated patients, and especially their admission to intensive-care units with acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), expose them to specific problems related to their therapy, in addition to those associated with the acute viral infection.
32473600, Patients on VKA hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 show high instability of PT INR due to the variability of vitamin K metabolism, diet, fasting, co-medications, liver impairment, and heart failure.
32473600, Patients on DOAC are exposed to under/over treatment caused by significant pharmacological interferences.
32473600, In consideration of the pharmacological characteristics of oral anticoagulant drugs, the multiple pharmacological interactions due to the treatment of acute disease and the possible necessity of mechanical ventilation with hospitalization in intensive-care units, we suggest replacing oral anticoagulant therapies (VKA and DOAC) with parenteral heparin to avoid the risk of over/under treatment.
32473600, Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment.
32473600, Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2-positive patients.
32473600, Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2 patients should be considered.
32473600, Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.
32473600, Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600,Since the first report of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the outbreak of the disease has been continuously evolving.
32473600, Until March 17, 2020, 185, 178 cases had been confirmed, including 81,134 cases in China and 104,044 cases outside of China.
32473600, In this comment, we report the unexpected beneficial effect of a deployable rapid-assembly shelter hospital on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32473600, We describe the shelter hospital maintenance, treatment mode and primary treatment methods, which will provide a valuable experience in dealing with public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, for other countries and areas.
32473600, It is emphasized that the indications for sleep study and NIPAP should be strictly defined according to the local epidemic situation.
32473600, Portable home sleep study and auto-titration positive airway pressure is recommended.
32473600, The applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer for sleep study and disposable or personal masks and ventilator tubing for NIPAP are strongly suggested.
32473600, Moreover, it is necessary to standardize the procedure of NIPAP, to separate the functional divisions in sleep lab, to comply with the protection regulations for medical personnel, and to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection management.
32473600, Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases.
32473600, The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.
32473600, But the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease are not clear yet.
32473600, Virological researches revealed close relationship between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.
32473600, The experience and knowledge we gained from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially with regard to the time course of viral replication, host immune response and clinical progression of the patient, may provide important insights into understanding and management of COVID-19.
32473600, Clinical deterioration accompanied by decreasing viral load in the second week after symptom onset was noted both in SARS and COVID-19, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to excessive host immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication.
32473600,The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs.
32473600, One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV.
32473600, Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients.
32473600, The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
32473600, A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
32473600, As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32473600, Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32473600, When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32473600, However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer.
32473600, Nutritional support is the basis of treatment.
32473600, It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically.
32473600, Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.
32473600, A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the application and development of therapeutics.
32473600, The degree to which the innate immune response confers protection or induces pathogenesis through a dysregulated immune response remains unclear.
32473600, In this review, we discuss what is known about the role of the innate immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest directions for future studies, and evaluate proposed COVID-19 immunomodulating therapeutics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound.
32473600, In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing.
32473600, Furthermore, we identified the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin as potential inhibitors of Mpro.
32473600, Rhamnetin is already commercially available in pharmacies.
32473600,The global response to finding therapeutics for COVID-19 is chaotic even if well intentioned.
32473600, There is an opportunity, but more importantly, an obligation for the global clinical and quantitative pharmacology community to come together and use our state-of-the-art tools and expertise to help society accelerate therapeutics to fight COVID-19.
32473600, This brief commentary is a call to action and highlights how the global pharmacology community should contribute to the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results.
32473600, In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role.
32473600, Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed.
32473600, In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.
32473600, Importantly, a number of the medications likely to receive significant use can themselves, particularly in combination, be pro-arrhythmic.
32473600, Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is primarily caused by inhibition of the hERG potassium channel either directly and/or by impaired channel trafficking.
32473600, Concurrent use of multiple hERG-blocking drugs may have a synergistic rather than additive effect which, in addition to any pre-existing polypharmacy, critical illness or electrolyte imbalance, may significantly increase the risk of arrhythmia and Torsades de Pointes.
32473600, Knowledge of these risks will allow informed decisions regarding appropriate therapeutics and monitoring to keep our patients safe.Copyright © 2020 Carpenter, Chambers, El Harchi, Bond, Hanington, Harmer, Hancox and James.
32473600, A much faster and by far more efficient method for rapidly identifying approved therapeutics that can be repurposed for treating COVID-19 patients is data mining their past and current electronic health and prescription records for identifying drugs that may protect infected individuals from severe COVID-19 symptoms.
32473600, Examples are discussed for applying health and prescription records for assessing the potential repurposing (repositioning) of angiotensin receptor blockers, estradiol, or antiandrogens for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities.
32473600, Data mining of prescription records of COVID-19 patients will not cancel the need for conducting controlled clinical trials, but could substantially assist in trial design, drug choice, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and prioritization.
32473600, This approach requires a strong commitment of health provides for open collaboration with the biomedical research community, as health provides are typically the sole owners of retrospective drug prescription records.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32473600, Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines.As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available.
32473600, This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.
32473600, Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.
32473600, In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-β and IL-10.
32473600, The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis.

32473600, Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
32473600, The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor.

32473600, Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains.
32473600, Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.
32473600, Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Thus, we aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic antibodies as well as diagnostics.
32473600, Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the COVID-19 crisis.
32473600, How can we best adapt as physicians and surgeons? What foundational ethical principles and systems of principle application can help guide our decision-making? Fortunately, a large body of work in medical ethics addresses these questions.
32473600, Unfortunately, many surgeons and other health care professionals are probably not as familiar with these concepts.
32473600, This brief communication is intended to provide a concise explanation of ethical considerations which readers may find helpful when addressing allocation of scarce resources and alterations in surgical care brought on by the current pandemic.
32473600, The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2.
32473600, Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics.

32473600, Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type.
32473600, It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.
32473600, The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.© 2020, Zhou et al.
32473600, Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals.
32473600, In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19.

32473600, We have also found that cell surface TLRs, especially TLR4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from SARS-CoV-2 to induce inflammatory responses.
32473600, The present study supported the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 from a bat and also revealed that TLR4 may have a crucial role in the virus-induced inflammatory consequences associated with COVID-19.
32473600, Therefore, selective targeting of TLR4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive TLR4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat COVID-19.
32473600, Finally, this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein, ACE2, or TLR-guided intervention strategy against COVID-19 shortly.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600, Viral antigens were observed in the bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia.
32473600, The phenomenon was not found in wild-type mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, Notably, we have confirmed the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice.
32473600, The mouse model with SARS-CoV-2 infection will be valuable for evaluating antiviral therapeutics and vaccines as well as understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32473600, The S protein of coronaviruses mediates viral receptor-binding and membrane fusion thus being considered a critical target for antivirals.
32473600, Herein, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein evolves a high activity to mediate cell-cell fusion, significantly differing from the S protein of the previously emerged SARS-CoV.
32473600, In comparison, the HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a much higher helical stability and can interact with the HR2 site to form a six-helical bundle structure more efficiently, underlying the mechanism of the enhanced fusion capacity.
32473600, Also importantly, the design of membrane fusion inhibitors with high potencies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has provided potential arsenals to combat the pandemic and tools to exploit the fusion mechanism.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32473600, The transcriptomic profiles were also exploited as possible novel therapeutic targets, and anti-signature perturbation analysis predicted potential drugs to control disease progression.
32473600, Among them, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors emerged as candidate drugs.

32473600, The amino acids Asp269, Leu370, His374, and His345 were predicted as the key residues for lopinavir binding to human SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex while His378, Tyr515, Leu73, Leu100, Phe32 and Phe40 for remdesivir and Tyr510, Phe504, Met62, Tyr50, and His378 were predicted for azithromycin as the key residues for binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex.
32473600, Moreover, it was also observed that chloroquine has appreciable binding affinities for 3-Chymotrpsin- like protease and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A when compared to Oseltamivir and ribavirin.

32473600, Crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs interfere with receptor binding.
32473600, We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion.
32473600, These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32473600, Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control.
32473600, However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics.
32473600, Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development.
32473600, In this review, we focus on our current understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapeutics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32473600, We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes.
32473600, Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes.
32473600, Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above.
32473600, Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, Although the overall structure is similar as other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct.
32473600, Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the β-sheet core.
32473600, Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.© 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

32473600, This article reports the potential drug target and mechanism of action of Arbidol (umifenovir) to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32473600, Molecular dynamics and structural analysis were used to show how Arbidol targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and impedes its trimerization, which is key for host cell adhesion and hijacking, indicating the potential of Arbidol to treat COVID-19.
32473600, It is hoped that knowledge of the potential drug target and mechanism of action of Arbidol will help in the development of new therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

32473600, This "protection by exclusion" of pregnant women from drug development and clinical therapeutic trials, even during epidemics and pandemics, is not unprecedented.
32473600, Moreover, it is both misguided and not justifiable and may have excluded them from potentially beneficial interventions.
32473600, This is another missed opportunity to obtain pregnancy-specific safety and efficacy data, because therapeutics developed for men and nonpregnant women may not be generalizable to pregnant women.
32473600, Therefore, we recommend and urge the scientific community and professional societies that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19 based on the concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent.
32473600, While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favor a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV-axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited.Proposed interventions for SARS-CoV-2 predominantly focus on viral microbiology and aim to inhibit viral cellular injury.
32473600, While these therapies are promising, immediate use may not be feasible, and the time window of their efficacy remains a major unanswered question.
32473600, An alternative approach is the modulation of the specific downstream pathophysiologic effects caused by virus that lead to morbidity and mortality.
32473600, We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV-axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.Copyright ©ERS 2020.

32473600, Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures.
32473600, COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection.
32473600, Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced.
32473600, Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.
32473600, Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia.
32473600, Viral antigens were detected mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages.SARS-CoV-2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia in old monkeys than that in young monkeys.

32473600, The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity.
32473600, This report presents initial data from the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; New Orleans, Louisiana; and New York City, New York* to describe the relationship between timing of public policy measures, community mobility (a proxy measure for social distancing), and temporal trends in reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.
32473600, Community mobility in all four locations declined from February 26, 2020 to April 1, 2020, decreasing with each policy issued and as case counts increased.
32473600, This report suggests that public policy measures are an important tool to support social distancing and provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVID-19.
32473600, The authors emphasize that the two basic values of safety/security and intellectual freedom of research must be considered evenly.
32473600, From the perspective of responsible development of biotechnology, this paper calls for a careful assessment to the risks of the technology, replacing risky technologies with safe ones.
32473600, The risks of publication also need to be strictly assessed.

32473600, Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%).
32473600, In multivariable analysis, peak ALT was significantly associated with death or discharge to hospice (OR 1.14, p=0.044), controlling for age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, intubation, and renal replacement therapy.Acute liver injury is common in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, but is most often mild.
32473600, However, among the 6.4% of patients with severe liver injury, a severe disease course should be anticipated.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, As far as infection pathophysiology is still not completely clarified, this review focuses also on the cardiovascular (CV) implication of COVID-19 and the capability of this virus to cause direct myocardial injury, myocarditis and other CV manifestations.
32473600, Furthermore, we highlight the relationship between the virus, enzyme ACE2 and ACE inhibitors.
32473600, Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
32473600, Aim of this review is then to summarize what is actually known about the SARS-CoV2 and its cardiovascular implications.
32473600, A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure.
32473600, All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) in which ACE 2 plays a central role.
32473600, In the last few days, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection.
32473600, In this article we will try to reorder the major opinions currently emerging on this topic.

32473600, COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32473600, As SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, we cannot ignore the risk of transmission during hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
32473600, Our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center prioritizes preventing the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining operation for the patients during the pandemic.
32473600, The aim of this article is to share the protocol that we have adopted in our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32473600,recent studies have provided novel evidence regarding the effect of nicotine agonists on the prevention or modulation of cytokines storm and reduction of infection.

32473600, Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine.
32473600, The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2-7).
32473600, All patients recovered.
32473600, More research is needed to understand the risks of COVID-19 among PLWH and the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19.
32473600, In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended.
32473600, The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system.
32473600, Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients.
32473600, D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.
32473600, The mean number of stroke codes dispatched to hospitals decreased (78% versus 57%, P<0.001).
32473600, Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed >30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways.
32473600, Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges.
32473600, It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.
32473600, Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides.
32473600, Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders.
32473600, Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32473600, This review aimed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth summarization of the contribution of graphene-based nanomaterials in liquid biopsy, discussing the remaining challenges and the future trend; moreover, the paper gave the first look at the potentiality of graphene in COVID-19 diagnosis.

32473600, The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established.Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease.
32473600, These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection.
32473600, Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy.
32473600, Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.
32473600, Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: "mild",symbolized as a "drizzle" of cytokines, severe as a "storm", and critical as a "hurricane". In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage.
32473600, In severe phenotype, resembling a "cytokine-release syndrome", SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure.
32473600, In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.
32473600, No patients died.On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old.
32473600, Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy.
32473600, Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission.
32473600, These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.
32473600, The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for ICU and desired more time for it.
32473600, Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about using mobile phones for remote monitoring, and AI-based intelligent alarm management.This survey study among ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine.
32473600, Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm SOPs, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing digital literacy of ICU staff.
32473600, Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03514173; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03514173.
32473600, These drugs are known to induce an increased expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32473600, ACE2 acts as receptor for the novel SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which raising the important issue of possible detrimental effects that RAS blockers could exert on the natural history and pathogenesis of the COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) and associated excessive inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
32473600, We review the current knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and RAS blockers and suggest a scientific rationale for continuing RAS blockers therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32473600, Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited.
32473600, We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.
32473600, Graphical abstract.
32473600, One patient had limited intraperitoneal bleeding while anticoagulated, which was managed by mechanical compression of the abdominal wall and temporarily holding anticoagulation.
32473600, All other catheters had an adequate function at 3-18 days of follow-up.Bedside placement of PD catheters is safe and effective in ICU and outpatient clinic settings.
32473600, Our surgical protocols allowed for optimization of critical hospital resources, minimization of hazardous exposure to healthcare providers and a broader application of urgent-start PD in selected patients.
32473600, Long-term follow-up is warranted.
32473600, COVID-19 will lead to a marked loss of transplant opportunities and a significantly larger national waiting list.

32473600, Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise is a non-invasive, physical therapy, that has been suggested as part of the procedures involved with pulmonary rehabilitation, even in ICU settings.
32473600, Therefore, in the current review, the World Association of Vibration Exercise Experts (WAVEX) reviewed the potential of WBV exercise as a useful and safe intervention for the management of infected individuals with COVID-19 by mitigating the inactivity-related declines in physical condition and reducing the time in ICU.
32473600, Recommendations regarding the reduction of fatigue and the risk of dyspnea, the improvement of the inflammatory and redox status favoring cellular homeostasis and the overall improvement in the quality of life are provided.
32473600, Finally, practical applications for the use of this paradigm leading to a better prognosis in bed bound and ICU-bound subjects is proposed.
32473600, The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients.Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a "shut down" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro®. The ClotPro® parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation.These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy.
32473600, Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy.
32473600, At present, the authorization of a clinical trial that attempts to answer these questions is in progress.

32473600, All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide.
32473600, At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital.
32473600, The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days).This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Our initial data suggest that VV ECMO can be successfully utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with advanced respiratory failure.

32473600, In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems- and policy-level requirements that are needed.
32473600, We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions.
32473600, We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system.
32473600, Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32473600, Conclusions: Coagulation parameters should be monitored closely in critical COVID-2019 patients.
32473600, The timing and protocol of anticoagulation therapy are still under investigation based on more clinical data.

32473600, In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging.
32473600, We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer.
32473600, As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed.
32473600, As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries.

32473600, Chronic cardiac disease might be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop heart failure.
32473600, The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on the 11th March 2020, and as of 29th of April 2020 more than 3 million cases have been reported worldwide with over 225 000 confirmed deaths.
32473600, Where mechanical ventilation may not be enough, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could play a role as a form of rescue therapy and may provide beneficial results in the hands of skilled clinicians in centers with experience of using ECMO appropriately in selected patients.
32473600, Our understanding of COVID-19 is ever-changing and the need for intensive care beds is rising, which means that ECMO will surely play a key role in the near future.© 2020 The Authors.

32473600, In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (p<0.001).
32473600, However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; p=0.60).
32473600, No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.Our findings suggest that prior use of RAAS inhibitors was not independently associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in Korea.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600, A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
32473600, Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
32473600, Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
32473600, Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.World Health Organization.

32473600, None required oxygen therapy, and 7 could be managed as outpatients.COVID-19 disease appears to have a similar clinical course in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies, even in immunosuppressed cases, as in healthy children of the same age; however, special attention must be paid to fluid management and drug dose adjustment.
32473600, Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and adequate management of organ failure are the mainstays of therapy.
32473600, In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres.

32473600, Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures.A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit.In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented stresses on modern medical systems, overwhelming the resource infrastructure in numerous countries while presenting a unique series of pathophysiologic clinical findings.
32473600, Thrombotic coagulopathy is common in critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19, with associated high rates of respiratory failure requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation.
32473600, Here we report a case series of five patients suffering from profound, medically refractory COVID-19 associated respiratory failure who were treated with fibrinolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase).
32473600, All five patients appeared to have an improved respiratory status following tPA administration: one patient had an initial marked improvement that partially regressed after several hours, one patient had transient improvements that were not sustained, and three patients had sustained clinical improvements following tPA administration.
32473600, Almost all countries started to take proactive precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.
32473600, The education sector, including pharmacy education, has been drastically impacted by this pandemic.
32473600, During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health profession's schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation.
32473600, In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the advanced pharmacy practice experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia.We believe that this experience could provide guidance and insights for other pharmacy schools dealing with this issue during this global pandemic.© 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.
32473600, Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter, and 76% of all studies were single-center.Conclusion: Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy.
32473600, Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.

32473600, Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia.
32473600, Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy.
32473600, Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.
32473600, In this context, further studies are needed to optimise the decision making in therapeutic approach.
32473600, Those restrictions have also impacted the urologic community.

32473600, Co-variates associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19 amongst persons with CML were exposure to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 (P = 0.037), no complete haematologic response (P = 0.003) and co-morbidity(ies) (P = 0.024).
32473600, There was also an increased risk of developing COVID-19 in subjects in advanced phase CML (P = 0.004) even when they achieved a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response at the time of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 1 of 21 subjects receiving 3rd generation tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) developed COVID-19 versus 3 of 346 subjects receiving imatinib versus 0 of 162 subjects receiving 2nd generation TKIs (P = 0.096).
32473600, Other co-variates such as age and TKI-therapy duration were not significantly associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19.
32473600, Persons with these risk factors may benefit from increased surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible protective isolation.

32473600, One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain.
32473600, Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment.
32473600, Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants.
32473600, These results pave the way for using S309- and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.
32473600, Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004).Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32473600, Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.Copyright © 2020 American College of Surgeons.

32473600, Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated.
32473600, The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited.
32473600, Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results.
32473600, Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600,During the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the benefit of treating patients with cancer must be weighed against the COVID-19 infection risks to patients, staff and society.
32473600, Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and raises particular interest during the pandemic as recent reports show that the TMPRSS2 (and other serine proteases), which facilitate the entry, replication and budding of the virion from a cell, can be inhibited using androgen deprivation therapy.
32473600, Nevertheless, patients with metastatic prostate cancer commonly receive chemotherapy which may compromise their immune system.
32473600, This paper aims to address the current status of the COVID-19 in patients with cancer overall and suggests an optimal approach to patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
32473600, Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient.
32473600, Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA.
32473600, Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies.
32473600, Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.

32473600, We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the profession's reputation.
32473600, The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students.It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy.
32473600, We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised.
32473600, We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.
32473600,The rapid spread of the corona virus pandemic is an existential problem for many people in numerous countries.
32473600, So far, there is no effective vaccine protection or proven therapy available against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32473600, In this review, we describe the role of passive immunization in times of the corona virus.
32473600, Passive immunization could be a bridging technology to improve the immune defense of critically ill patients until better approaches with effective medications are available.
32473600, We hypothesize that participants who are randomly assigned to receive 2-4 sessions of Solution Focused Brief Therapy would have better clinical outcomes than participants who are in the waitlist group.
32473600, We additionally hypothesized that using SFBT can also change participants' depression levels and their coping strategies in dealing with distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.This study employs a randomized delayed crossover open label controlled trial in adolescents who are presenting anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, Participants who meet the enrollment criteria stated below will be invited to participate in this study through telecommunication.
32473600, Those accepting will be randomly allocated to the intervention group or waitlist group.
32473600, In the control group the mortality was 16.13% and the overcome from infection was 83.87%. Conclusion: Mortality for COVID-19 was greater in cancer patients when compared with noncancer patients, worse prognosis for older age, women and patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone.
32473600, However, the comparisons did not reach statistical significance in most cases.
32473600, This could be due to the small sample size that is the main limitation of the study.
32473600, Faced with this novel coronavirus, scientists have been trying to use drugs that have not been validated by rigorous clinical trials, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
32473600, These drugs may be used tentatively for general population with COVID-19, but for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with long-term immunosuppressive therapy and drug-related metabolic diseases, antiviral drugs should be chosen with particular care.
32473600, Notably, the elderly SOT patients commonly suffer from liver and kidney dysfunction of varying degrees, resulting in worse drug metabolism.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6-9 months during the pandemic.
32473600, Patients established on denosumab and teriparatide should continue planned therapy.
32473600, The challenge of this pandemic will act as a catalyst to innovate within our management of metabolic bone and mineral disorders to ensure best use of resources and resilience of healthcare systems in its aftermath.
32473600, Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32473600, Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
32473600, This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.

32473600, The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia; 46%, Qatar; 46%, Iran; 33.4%, Chile; 26.4%) and midlatitude (France; 27.3%, Portugal; 21.2% and Austria; 19.3%) regions.
32473600, Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0% in some high latitude countries (e.g.
32473600, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands).Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19.
32473600, Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.
32473600, On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time.
32473600, On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative.
32473600, On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged.
32473600, At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90.In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.
32473600, Four studies with 542 Chinese participants were included.
32473600, Two studies reported negative findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, i.e., corticosteroids had a detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
32473600, One study reported no significant association between the use of corticosteroids and clinical outcomes.
32473600, However, one study, on 201 participants with different stages of pneumonia due to COVID-19, found that in more severe forms, the administration of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the risk of death by 62%. The literature to date does not fully support the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19, but some findings suggest that methylprednisolone could lower mortality rate in more severe forms of the condition.Copyright © 2020 Veronese, Demurtas, Yang, Tonelli, Barbagallo, Lopalco, Lagolio, Celotto, Pizzol, Zou, Tully, Ilie, Trott, López-Sánchez and Smith.
32473600, During infection and its complication such as sepsis, hypotension could be exacerbated by antihypertensive drugs because homeostasis mechanisms such as sodium balance, renin angiotensin aldosterone system and/or sympathetic nervous system can be mitigated by antihypertensive drug therapy.
32473600, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 and 2 viral surface protein is known to attach angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane to facilitate viral entry into the cytoplasm.
32473600, Despite the theoretical concerns of increased ACE2 expression by Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAS) blockade, there is no evidence that RAS inhibitors are harmful during COVID-19 infection and have in fact been shown to be beneficial in animal studies.
32473600, Therefore, it is recommended to maintain RAS blockade during the current corona virus pandemic.© The Author(s) 2020.

32473600, Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59).
32473600, A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40).Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections than non-cancer patients.

32473600,Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presently become a rapidly spreading and devastating global pandemic.
32473600, Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may serve as life-saving rescue therapy for refractory respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory compromise such as that induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32473600, While still little is known on the true efficacy of ECMO in this setting, the natural resemblance of seasonal influenza's characteristics with respect to acute onset, initial symptoms, and some complications prompt to ECMO implantation in most severe, pulmonary decompensated patients.
32473600, The present review summarizes the evidence on ECMO management of severe ARDS in light of recent COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time focusing on differences and similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO in terms of hematological and inflammatory interplay when these two settings merge.
32473600, These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research.
32473600, Controlled clinical trials are needed.
32473600, After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians.A range of themes emerged from the online discussion.
32473600, A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods.Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence-based practice.

32473600, Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general, and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients.
32473600, In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody.
32473600, In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase.

32473600, The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death).
32473600, Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States.These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic.
32473600, In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.
32473600, Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04308668); registered 16 March, 2020.
32473600, In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92).
32473600, Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4-12).
32473600, Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35-1.8).In this updated analysis, we confirm the very high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, However, the role of such agents as prophylactic tools is still not clear.This is a retrospective study based on a large healthcare computerized database including all patients that were screened for the "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2" (SARS-CoV-2) in the study period from February 23rd 2020 to March 31st 2020.
32473600, A comparison was conducted between subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those found negative in terms of rate of administration of hydroxychloroquine/colchicine therapy.An overall sample of 14,520 subjects were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1317 resulted positive.
32473600, No significant difference was found in terms of rates of usage of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine between those who were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who were found negative (0.23% versus 0.25% for hydroxychloroquine, and 0.53% versus 0.48% for colchicine, respectively).These findings raise doubts regarding the protective role of these medications in the battle against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32473600, An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined.
32473600, More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
32473600, Herewith, presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.
32473600, Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.
32473600, In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.
32473600, Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.
32473600, Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.

32473600, Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19.
32473600, Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization.
32473600, Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field.As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
32473600, We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.© 2020 The Author(s).

32473600, In this context, novel approaches in both gene therapy and vaccine development are essential.
32473600, Previous experience from SARS- and MERS-coronavirus vaccine and drug development projects have targeted glycoprotein epitopes, monoclonal antibodies, angiotensin receptor blockers and gene silencing technologies, which may be useful for COVID-19 too.
32473600, Moreover, existing antivirals used for other types of viral infections have been considered as urgent action is necessary.
32473600, This review aims at providing a background of coronavirus genetics and biology, examples of therapeutic and vaccine strategies taken and potential innovative novel approaches in progress.
32473600, Here we present a series of five cases of severe pneumomediastinum requiring decompression therapy over a 7-day period in the current COVID-19 outbreak.
32473600, We hypothesise that the mechanism for this is the aggressive disease pathophysiology with an increased risk of alveolar damage and tracheobronchial injury along with the use of larger bore tracheal tubes and higher ventilation pressures.

32473600, As with any other infection, poorly controlled pre-existing diabetes can promote secondary infections and lead to acute complications related to hyperglycemia, worsened itself by the infection.
32473600, It is important to advise patients to have enough diabetic equipment and supplies at home, to make regular blood glucose self-tests, and to contact a caregiver immediately in case of glycemic imbalance or signs of infection.
32473600, Antidiabetic therapy may need adjustments following usual sick day rules.
32473600, Insulin therapy should be considered to treat any persistent hyperglycemia in patients hospitalized for an acute infection.
32473600, As of April 13, 1,773,084 people were infected and 111,652 people had died from COVID-19 globally, and new record levels of infection are being reported every day.
32473600, Based on the data that have been amassed so far, the primary risk factors for a severe disease course or even mortality from COVID-19 are underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.
32473600, As the global prevalence of diabetes continues to increase, patients with endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus and those who are on long-term corticosteroid therapy due to adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism are at risk for a poor prognosis of COVID-19.

32473600, Considering the debility, neurological, pulmonary, neuromuscular and cognitive complications, rehabilitation professionals can play an important role in the recovery process for individuals with COVID-19.
32473600, Clinicians across the nation's rehabilitation system have already begun working to initiate intensive care unit-based rehabilitation care and develop programs, settings and specialized care to meet the short- and long-term needs of these individuals.
32473600, We describe the anticipated rehabilitation demands, and the strategies to meet the needs of this population.
32473600, The complications from COVID-19 can be reduced by (1) delivering interdisciplinary rehabilitation that is initiated early and continued throughout the acute hospital stay, (2) providing patient/family education for self-care after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation at either acute or subacute settings, and (3) continuing rehabilitation care in the outpatient setting, and at home through ongoing therapy either in-person or via telehealth.
32473600,Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19 thereby increasing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 like other procedures such as tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
32473600, Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients and patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
32473600, Recommendations for sleep clinics and sleep laboratory activities are also discussed as well as the emergency use of PAP devices as a substitute for ventilation.Copyright © 2020 The Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

32473600, The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event.
32473600, However, it is not possible to ascertain which adverse events were directly related to tocilizumab therapy.
32473600, In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement and reduced ventilatory support requirements.
32473600, Given the study's limitations, the results require assessment in adequately powered randomized controlled trials.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600, The world was initially viewing it as a localized outbreak in Wuhan city of China; however, it started spreading quickly to other parts of the world.
32473600, Globally, half-hearted containment measures and a false sense of safety against this novel coronavirus led to the dissemination of disease.
32473600, Currently, no effective therapy or vaccine is available to manage this illness.
32473600, After learning a huge lesson, global efforts would hopefully lead to effective control of this pandemic.
32473600, Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant.
32473600, Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008).
32473600, Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups.Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.
32473600, Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.
32473600, This certainly generates insecurity and fear in people, with an important psychological component that is not to be underestimated at this stage of the pandemic.
32473600, The purpose of this article is to highlight all the sources currently present in the literature concerning the persistence of the different coronaviruses in the environment as well as in medical and dental settings.
32473600, As this was a current study, there are still not many sources in the literature, and scientific strategies are moving towards therapy and diagnosis, rather than knowing the characteristics of the virus.
32473600, Such an article could be an aid to summarize virus features and formulate new guidelines and anti-spread strategies.

32473600, Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered.
32473600, Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles.
32473600, Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management.This paper evaluates the issues surrounding these challenges including the OR environment and AGPs which are germane to surgical practices around the world.

32473600, Patients with malignant diseases are assumed to be at increased risk for a worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore, guidance regarding prevention and management of the infection as well as safe administration of cancer-therapy is required.
32473600, Here, we provide recommendations for the management of patients with malignant disease in the times of COVID-19.
32473600, These recommendations were prepared by an international panel of experts and then consented by the EHA Scientific Working Group on Infection in Hematology.
32473600, The primary aim is to enable clinicians to provide optimal cancer care as safely as possible, since the most important protection for patients with malignant disease is the best-possible control of the underlying disease.
32473600, The threat of COVID-19 is particularly serious as there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy.
32473600, Further complications are introduced by shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients and effective testing to identify infected patients, raising the need for delaying some testing and therapies.
32473600, Certain vulnerable segments of the general population have been identified (advanced age and certain comorbidities), which should heighten further their preventive efforts.
32473600, Therefore, this guidance is intended to be operationalized depending on a facility's specific needs and local disease prevalence.
32473600, This has implications on standard cardiac care for ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs).
32473600, In the setting of anticipated resource scarcity in the future, we are forced to reconsider fibrinolytic therapy in our management algorithms.
32473600, We encourage clinicians to maintain a high level of suspicion for STEMI mimics, such as myopericarditis which is a known, not infrequent, complication of COVID-19 disease.
32473600, Herein, we present a pathway developed by a multidisciplinary panel of stakeholders at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center for the management of STEMI in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
32473600, We included five studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients.
32473600, The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma.
32473600, Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients appears safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality.
32473600, Well-designed large multicenter clinical trial studies should be conducted urgently to establish the efficacy of CPT to COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600, Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge.
32473600, The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those ≤65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47).
32473600, No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
32473600, Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

32473600, The infection spread first in China and then in the rest of the world, and on the 11th of March, the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
32473600, Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5-7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9-11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection.
32473600, Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-α inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy.
32473600, Considering that the COVID-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, a dietary regimen modification in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of patients, improving their outcomes.
32473600, The lungs are the target of the primary infection and patients with lung cancer seem to have a poor prognosis.

32473600,Cancer patients in conflict settings experience significant barriers in accessing chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as palliative care and psychosocial support.
32473600, Now they face an additional possible risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus and the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on movement restrictions and their access to care.
32473600, In this commentary, we highlight that despite the low COVID-19 burden in conflict settings like Gaza, COVID-19 could lead to further inequity in cancer care and poorer outcomes for Palestinians with cancer.
32473600, This is due to the pre-existing shortage in cancer resources as well as the lack of context-specific guidelines to prepare for COVID-19 in war-torn settings.© the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.
32473600, Patients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, whereas patients who underwent only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared with patients without cancer.
32473600, These findings indicate that patients with cancer appear more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 outbreak.

32473600, All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies.
32473600, Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm.
32473600, However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools.

32473600, However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited.
32473600, The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32473600, These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care.

32473600, First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course? This is a particularly relevant question because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19.
32473600, Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines?

32473600, For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations.
32473600, The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption.
32473600, Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.

32473600, Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases.
32473600, Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome.
32473600, Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia.
32473600, To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases.
32473600, The first was "How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic?" The second was "What general advice should we give to people with epilepsy during this crisis? Authors individually scored statements on a scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to +10 (strongly agree). 5/11 recommendations for physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all authors as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating.
32473600, Subsequently, a tele-conference was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were revised.After revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or above.
32473600, The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication.

32473600, The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs.
32473600, The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34).
32473600, Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs.This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients.
32473600, These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Based on our analysis and evaluation of the available findings, we justify our conclusion: important drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should continue to be prescribed according to guidelines to stable patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32473600, Previous to the pandemic we commonly utilized total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with a strong preference for long course chemoradiation (LCCRT).
32473600, In the setting of the ongoing pandemic we now mandate short course radiation therapy (SCRT).
32473600, Despite multiple randomized trials demonstrating no difference in locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or overall survival between SCRT and LRCCT, adaptation of SCRT in the United States has been low given concerns for less tumor downstaging and increased toxicity.
32473600, In the setting of the ongoing and likely prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we feel that these concerns must be re-evaluated, as SCRT presents a well-validated alternative that will allow us to meet the needs of a greater number of potentially curable patients, at a time when our resources are severely and acutely constrained.© 2020 The Author(s).
32473600, COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that has been declared a pandemic.
32473600, Challenges for inpatient psychiatry include risky close contact among staff and patients, space constraints, and structural barriers in care delivery.
32473600, Nuanced considerations of five contingency planning strategies in response to COVID-19 are described, including COVID-19-specific precautions, visitor restrictions, physician workforce considerations, operational adjustments, and group therapy changes.
32473600, Organized leadership and clear communication are identified as early priorities in pandemic response to minimize misinformation and address immediate challenges.
32473600, The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications.
32473600, In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried.
32473600, The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for new infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering.The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families.
32473600, Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473600, Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3).
32473600, A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period.
32473600, The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients.
32473600, Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.

32473600,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and sent all countries scrambling to review emergency healthcare provisions.
32473600, There is global evidence of each nation struggling to effectively manage the number of people being diagnosed with the virus.
32473600, These are testing times which have not been experienced in recent generations and there are a number of insecurities regarding the management of people with COVID-19 and cardiometabolic diseases.
32473600, This review highlights the current concerns related to COVID-19 and provides advice in terms of the therapeutic uncertainty and potential adverse harms associated with therapy when managing people, particularly those with cardiometabolic diseases, who have contracted or are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

32473600, The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions.
32473600, The COVID-19 disease appeared mild, without major respiratory problems, and no obvious neuromuscular deterioration was reported or observed.
32473600, Telerehabilitation provided an opportunity to continue with hand rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery, perform an ad-hoc online evaluation, and advise the patient how to prevent the spread of infection and cope with restrictions limiting outpatient visits.
32473600, This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits.
32473600, As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital.
32473600, Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32473600, Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.
32473600, These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.
32473600, The first rapid "living" review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020.A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: "Covid-19", "Coronavirus", "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "rehabilitation", "physical therapy modalities", "exercise", "occupational therapy", and "late complications". Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included.Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review.
32473600, Four of them are "calls for action", 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients.All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic.
32473600, Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home.
32473600, Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in Covid-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.
32473600, Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders.
32473600, Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19.
32473600, This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed.

32473600, Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO2/FiO2 of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria).
32473600, Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated.
32473600, Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature.The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients.
32473600, When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.

32473600, In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy.
32473600, The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only a small percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own.
32473600, This result was independent of the individual anti-rheumatic therapy.
32473600, Taken together, the results of this study illustrate not only the trustful patient-physician partnership in a threatening situation but also the high impact of state-of-the art recommendations by the respective scientific society.

32473600, An exploratory statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t test.During the pandemic period, the number of new order verifications decreased from approximately 5,000 orders per day to 3,300 orders per day (P < 0.01), a reduction of 30% during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to the weeks prior.
32473600, Average daily pharmacokinetic dosing consults were reduced in the pandemic period (from 82 to 67; P < 0.01) compared to the prepandemic period; however, total daily pharmacist interventions did not differ significantly (473 vs 456; P = 0.68).
32473600, Dispensing of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, enoxaparin, and sedative medications increased substantially during the pandemic period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons).The operational and clinical requirements of an inpatient pharmacy department shifted considerably during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

32473600, Conclusions Overall 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone.
32473600, The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.
32473600, Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%).
32473600, The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%).
32473600, Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients.Tracking of tele-consultations and access to patient information from the electronic medical records enabled a timely response in an ongoing lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, The current experience provided valuable insights to the possibility of managing patient follow-up visits remotely in the future.
32473600, Unmet healthcare needs were more frequent among migrants without healthcare coverage than among recent immigrants or the citizens with health healthcare coverage (69%, 26%, 16%).
32473600, Canada must take measures to enable these individuals to have access to healthcare according to their needs in order to reduce the risk of worsening their health status, something that may have an impact on the healthcare system and population health.
32473600, The Government of Quebec announced that all individuals without any healthcare coverage will have access to COVID-19 related health care.

32473600, However, several patients and health care professionals still fail to voluntarily report adverse events.
32473600, For health care providers, some barriers to reporting may include fear of negative feedback, apathy, legal concerns, and uncertainty about whether an incident qualifies as an ADR.
32473600, In the current COVID-19 Crisis, it is especially important for health care providers to be diligent about reporting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), since misinformation propagated by the media is causing patients to misuse certain medications.
32473600, We need to shift the current thought process about ADR reporting in order to encourage a positive reporting culture by patients and health care providers.© The Author(s) 2020.
32473600, Troponin levels were significantly correlated with heart rate (r = 0.387, p = .006) but not with ECG parameters.Conclusion: Several ventricular arrhythmia surface ECG predictors including QTc, QTd, and Tpe/QTc are increased in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, Since medications used in COVID-19 patients have the potential to affect these parameters, giving importance to these ECG markers may have a significant contribution in decreasing disease-related arrhythmias.
32473600, Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin.
32473600, Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients.
32473600, However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive.
32473600, Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.

32473600,Much of the focus regarding the global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic complications.
32473600, However, neurologic complications have arisen as an increasingly recognized area of morbidity and mortality.This brief report summarizes the neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician.COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide.
32473600, While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
32473600, Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications.When caring for COVID-19 patients, emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the neurologic complications from COVID-19.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32473600, It is a priority to produce data both rapidly and accurately in order to identify current therapies that can be repurposed to offer protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, As healthcare workers are both at high risk for infection and able to be readily diagnosed, they offer a potential wealth of data to be analyzed.
32473600, A systematic data analysis of exposure and infection rates among healthcare workers could yield patterns identifying common protective factors, such as medications with prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2, that can be fast-tracked into available therapies.
32473600, With results suggesting their activity against other coronaviruses and their widespread adoption, Antiretroviral cocktails could be a promising initial target for such large-scale data analysis approach.
32473600, Using data from a prospective study of young, low-income mothers who survived Hurricane Katrina, we find that bereavement, fearing for loved ones' well-being, and lacking access to medical care and medications predict adverse mental and physical health 1 y postdisaster, and some effects persist 12 y later.
32473600, Adjusting for preexisting health and socioeconomic conditions attenuates, but does not eliminate, these associations.
32473600, The findings, while drawn from a demographically unique sample, suggest that, to mitigate the indirect effects of COVID-19, lapses in medical care and medication use must be minimized, and public health resources should be directed to those with preexisting medical conditions, their social networks, and the bereaved.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

32473600, Interestingly, some reports indicate that this wonder drug may be also beneficial for COVID-19 and accordingly, many clinical trials have begun.
32473600, Here, we discuss different modes of action (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inhibition of endosomal acidification, suppression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 glycosylation, etc.) of HCQ that might be responsible for its possible anti-COVID-19 effect.
32473600, On the other hand, this review also makes an honest attempt to delineate mechanisms (increase in vasoconstriction, inhibition of autophagy, depletion of T cells, etc.) indicating how it may aggravate certain conditions and why caution should be taken before granting widespread repurposing of HCQ for COVID-19.

32473600, Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown, and increased the use of psychotropic medication.
32473600, People with intellectual disability are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them.
32473600, In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 has on people with intellectual disability.
32473600, Collecting the evidence through a rigorous approach should help to empower people with intellectual disability and their carers to face future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

32473600, Conclusion In a substantial percentage of patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent non-chest CT, the CT provided the first evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia.
32473600, The proposed PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations' Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Guidance, health departments and emergency preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions.Based on methods and resources utilized in developing this proposed PEPR Framework, five key focus areas were identified, as follows: CONCLUSION: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements.
32473600, Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking.
32473600, Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams.
32473600, Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies.

32473600, While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result.She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody.
32473600, She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability.She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family's wishes and passed away.With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems.
32473600, While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections.
32473600, The alarming increase in cases per day adds additional pressure to find a cure and decrease the global health burden and mortality rate.

32473600, Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus but the reasons are unclear.
32473600, This review will highlight the relationship of coronavirus disease 2019 with hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective.
32473600, We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers affect this important pathway.
32473600, Given the importance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019.
32473600, On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports.
32473600, These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse.

32473600, Here, we raise the importance of stringent diagnosis and data collection regarding neurological complications of COVID-19; we urge caution in the over-diagnosis of neurological disease where it does not exist, but equally strongly encourage the concerted surveillance for such conditions.
32473600, Additional to the direct neurological complications of COVID-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32473600, We therefore also outline the specific management of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases in the context of the pandemic.
32473600, This article describes the implications of COVID-19 on neurological disease and advertises the Neurocritical Care Society's international data collection collaborative that seeks to align data elements.
32473600, This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals.One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged.
32473600, Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth ¥1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved.The new COVID-19 "module" pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and "zero contact" pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform "WeChat." This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects.With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation.The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease.
32473600, They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease.The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.Copyright © 2020 American Pharmacists Association®.

32473600, We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.The study design is a rapid evidence review.We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak.We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review.
32473600, Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work.People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.
32473600, To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32473600, Fifty-five poison centers in the United States provide free, 24-hour professional advice and medical management information regarding exposures to poisons, chemicals, drugs, and medications.
32473600, Call data from poison centers are uploaded in near real-time to NPDS.
32473600, During January-March 2020, poison centers received 45,550 exposure calls related to cleaners (28,158) and disinfectants (17,392), representing overall increases of 20.4% and 16.4% from January-March 2019 (37,822) and January-March 2018 (39,122), respectively.
32473600, Although NPDS data do not provide information showing a definite link between exposures and COVID-19 cleaning efforts, there appears to be a clear temporal association with increased use of these products.
32473600, During viral pandemics, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise the application of airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures, such as aerosolized medications.Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including fit-tested particulate respirators should be worn when administering nebulized medications to patients.
32473600, These PPEs have been in short supply in the US during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is increasing the risk faced by health care workers (HCWs) who are treating patients using aerosolized medications.
32473600, Despite taking appropriate precautions, HCWs are becoming infected with COVID-19.
32473600, This may be related to secondary exposure related to viral longevity in fugitive emissions and viability on fomites.We have expanded on non-US public health recommendations to provide guidance to frontline HCWs to enhance collaboration between clinicians, who are often siloed in their clinical practices, and ultimately to protect the federal workforce, which cannot sustain a significant loss of frontline HCWs.Copyright © 2020 Frontline Medical Communications Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA.
32473600, The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32473600, COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness.
32473600, The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events.

32473600, From the analysis of distribution data, the endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries.
32473600, In this sense, molecular and genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., in ACE2) might play a protective role against coronavirus infection.
32473600, Moreover, the mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects (e.g., retinal toxicity).
32473600, All these data provide important insights to understand the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of some currently available medications.
32473600, The contribution of community pharmacists in these facilities to manage chronic conditions and promote medication adherence during this COVID-19 pandemic will be essential in easing the burden on already strained health systems.
32473600, This paper highlights the pharmaceutical care practices of community pharmacists for patients with chronic diseases during this pandemic.

32473600, We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak.
32473600, We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.
32473600, This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring.
32473600, These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment.
32473600, To continue to deliver quality care for this patient population, palliative medicine must adapt quickly.
32473600, However, the real presence bedside (forth question) was considered irreplaceable.

32473600, Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute planning response.The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32473600, Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response.
32473600, Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.
32473600, Hospices may also need to be proactive in connecting with the acute pandemic response.
32473600, In a palliative care clinic, this apprehension gets exemplified, as these patients have limited life expectancy.
32473600, The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted.
32473600, This document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context.
32473600, Practical steps suggested are protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the role of a wider community support.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32473600, However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
32473600, Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
32473600, According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience.To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis.We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population.
32473600, The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home.Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units.
32473600, Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients.Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow.

32473600, Primary outcome of the study was to assess the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and obesity classes according to BMI.92 patients (61.9% males; age 70.5±13.3 years) were enrolled.
32473600, Patients with overweight and obesity were younger than normal-weight patients (68.0±12.6 and 67.0±12.6 years vs. 76.1±13.0 years, p<0.01).
32473600, A higher need for assisted ventilation beyond pure oxygen support (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation or Non-Invasive Ventilation) and a higher admission to intensive or semi-intensive care units was observed in patients with overweight and obesity (p<0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) even after adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively), or when patients with dementia or advanced cancer were removed from the analysis (p<0.05).Patients with overweight and obesity admitted in a medical ward for SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive or semi-intensive care units than normal weight patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600,Obesity represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and premature death.
32473600, The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, finally inadequate and excessive immunological responses, possibly aggravated by ectopic intrathoracic fat depots.
32473600, Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called « obesity paradox » commonly reported by intensivists in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32473600, These findings require reinforced preventive and curative measures among obese patients to limit the risk of progression towards an unfavorable outcome in case of COVID-19.
32473600, They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.Two patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.
32473600, A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.
32473600, The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.
32473600, Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.
32473600, However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization.
32473600, Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal.
32473600, Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency.
32473600, Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.
32473600, However, more attention should be paid with respect to the risk of viral diffusion among asymptomatic people.
32473600, Italy is the second most involved country in the world, and we needed to gain a lot of experience in a very limited time.
32473600, At least 1 m of distance among people is recommended; however, some clinical practices cannot allow this distance.
32473600, In this context, we believe that the careful safety assessment of clinical settings, like ophthalmologic ones, may have a remarkable impact on the fight against SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32473600, In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified.
32473600, Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection.
32473600, Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission.
32473600, Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95% CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95% CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission.
32473600, Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20%. Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, While people must stay at home to reduce the spread of this virus health-care workers do the exact opposite.
32473600, In some countries doctors are working with insufficient protection and are constantly at risk of contracting Covid-19.
32473600, Health-care workers should be constantly monitored because if they are infected they may spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members.
32473600, Increased rates of infection in health-care workers could cause the health-care system to collapse and a further worsening of the pandemic; if there are too few doctors it will be even more difficult to manage.

32473600, The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source.The new "Corona Curtain" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

32473600, Kernel maps were constructed for the data's visualization.
32473600, Level of significance was set at 5%. Four latent mortality profiles were observed.
32473600, The Health Regions with the highest mean mortality rates were located in regions with shortages of ICU beds and ventilators, especially in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, and South of Brazil.
32473600, The spatial localization of regions with both the highest mortality and shortages of ICU beds/ventilators requires attention by policymakers and public planners to deal efficiently and fairly with the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil.
32473600, Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS).
32473600, Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients.
32473600, It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473600, Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32473600, The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1-3-day delay of positive cases.
32473600, This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation.
32473600, The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function.
32473600, The high number of positive cases might have a direct and an indirect effect on the number of deaths, the latter being related to the overwhelmed bed capacity of intensive care units.Copyright © 2020 Iosa, Paolucci and Morone.
32473600,COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic emergency, distressing health systems in each affected country.
32473600, COVID-19 determines the need for healthcare in a large number of people in an extremely short time and, like a tsunami wave, overruns emergency, infectious diseases, and pneumology departments as well as intensive care units, choking healthcare services.
32473600, Rehabilitation services are also affected by this epidemic which forces radical changes both in the organization and in the operating methods.

32473600, Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80).
32473600, The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.Instituto de Salud Carlos III.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32473600, Resources shortening is a critical issue when the number of COVID-19 severe cases are higher than the available resources.
32473600, This is also the case at a regional scale.
32473600, We analysed Italian data at regional level with the aim to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a geographic model to plan emergency and future COVID-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures.
32473600, Finally, we retain that the here proposed model can be also used in other countries.
32473600, It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic and financial impacts.
32473600, This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine.
32473600, In specific, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness towards public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation/ active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts.
32473600, It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.

32473600, With intensive care units operating at maximum capacity and such staggering mortality rates reported, it is imperative during this time-sensitive COVID-19 outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and/or myocardial injury.
32473600, Preliminary findings from COVID-19 studies have shown the association of biomarkers of acute cardiac injury and coagulation with worse prognosis.
32473600, While these biomarkers are recognised for CVD, there is emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in COVID-19, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes.
32473600, Consequently, the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and to highlight considerations for incorporating laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in COVID-19 to optimise outcomes.
32473600, Everything and everyone are paused, with the exception of healthcare and other essential workers.

32473600, Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.
32473600, Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.
32473600, Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.
32473600, Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.
32473600, Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed.
32473600, Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed.
32473600, The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.
32473600, This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.
32473600, CT pulmonary angiography and chest CT scans revealed acute massive embolism and typical imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively.
32473600, Interestingly, the patient had no symptoms or signs of infection and also had no risk factors for thromboembolism.
32473600, COVID-19 infection appears to induce venous thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism.
32473600, The case is remarkable in terms of showing how insidious and life-threatening COVID-19 infection can be.
32473600, Preparing intensive care units (ICU) is an integral part of any pandemic response.
32473600, In this review, we discuss the key principles and strategies for ICU preparedness.
32473600, We also describe our initial outbreak measures and share some of the challenges faced.
32473600, To achieve sustainable ICU services, we propose the need to 1) prepare and implement rapid identification and isolation protocols, and a surge in ICU bed capacity; (2) provide a sustainable workforce with a focus on infection control; (3) ensure adequate supplies to equip ICUs and protect healthcare workers; and (4) maintain quality clinical management, as well as effective communication.
32473600, At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32473600, The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively.This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults.
32473600, Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children.
32473600, These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.
32473600, Based on available data from official Italian and regional sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the period between 2nd and 15th March 2020.
32473600, To better reflect the actual spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst scenarios.
32473600, We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Sardinia.

32473600, Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing.
32473600, We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents.Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum.It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis.
32473600, The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork.
32473600, We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training.© 2020 American Academy of Neurology.
32473600, The rapid surge of patients presenting over a small period for emergent clinical care, admission to the hospital, and intensive care units with many requiring mechanically assisted ventilators for respiratory support demonstrated the potential to overwhelm health care workers, hospitals, and health care systems.
32473600, The purpose of this article is to describe an effective system for redeployment of health care supplies, resources, and personnel to hospitals within a suburban academic hospital system to optimize the care of COVID patients, while treating orthopedic patients in an equally ideal setting to maximize their surgical and clinical care.

32473600, Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis.
32473600, Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.Copyright © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris.

32473600, Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc.
32473600, They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.Copyright © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris.

32473600, At present, chest-computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32473600, Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units.
32473600, In this short communication, we present our experimental CXR scoring system that we are applying to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to quantify and monitor the severity and progression of this new infectious disease.
32473600, We also present the results of our preliminary validation study on a sample of 100 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection for whom the final outcome (recovery or death) was available.
32473600, Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia.
32473600, This has grim implications for Nigeria, especially as increased cases loom that may require critical care.
32473600, Provision of quarantine or isolation facilities and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease can also be a challenge in Africa.There is an urgent need to put into perspective these realities peculiar to Africa including Nigeria and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies.Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard.
32473600, Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound.Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting.
32473600, However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus.The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.Copyright © 2020.

32473600, Systematic polymerase chain reaction-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended.
32473600, Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis.

32473600, Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration.From March 19 to April 11, 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE.
32473600, Eight patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation.
32473600, The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69%. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100% vs 56%, respectively, P = .03).
32473600, Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms.Our results suggest considering both systematic screening of VTE and early therapeutic anticoagulation in severe ICU COVID-19 patients.© 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

32473600, A large number of these patients end up in the intensive care units (ICU) with critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation.
32473600, One of the most important clinical features of the infection is a profound coagulopathy.
32473600, In a recent cohort study 71% of patients who eventually died matched the ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), while this percentage was only 0.6% in patients who survived.This article is protected by copyright.

32473600, Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase).
32473600, This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline).
32473600, An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators.The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19.
32473600, But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.© 2020 AMPCo Pty Ltd.

32473600, The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients.
32473600, A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning.
32473600, A clear communication plan should be implemented early and input from trainees, staff, and faculty should be solicited.Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis.
32473600, Surgical leadership, innovation, and flexibility are critical to successful planning and implementation.
32473600, However, obstetric patients are not immune from the current COVID-19 pandemic, and obstetric care will inevitably be impacted by the current epidemic.
32473600, As such, clinical protocols and practice on labor and delivery units must adapt to optimize the safety of patients and health care workers and to better conserve health care resources.
32473600, In this commentary, we provide suggestions to meet these goals without impacting maternal or neonatal outcomes.

32473600, Allocation of these resources to those most likely to benefit can be supported by clinical prediction models.
32473600, The ethical and practical considerations relevant to predictions supporting decisions about microallocation are distinct from those that inform shared decision-making in ways important for model design.We review three issues of importance for microallocation: (1) Prediction of benefit (or of medical futility) may be technically very challenging; (2) When resources are scarce, calibration is less important for microallocation than is ranking to prioritize patients, since capacity determines thresholds for resource utilization; (3) The concept of group fairness, which is not germane in shared decision-making, is of central importance in microallocation.
32473600, Therefore, model transparency is important.Prediction supporting allocation of life-saving interventions should be explicit, data-driven, frequently updated and open to public scrutiny.
32473600, This implies a preference for simple, easily understood and easily applied prognostic models.© The Author(s) 2020.
