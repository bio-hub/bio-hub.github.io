32473161, And some reports understate one benefit of reducing the frequency or proximity of interpersonal encounters, a reduction in the total number of infections.
32473161, In hopes that understanding will increase compliance, we describe how social distancing a) reduces the peak incidence of infections, b) delays the occurrence of this peak, and c) reduces the total number of infections during epidemics.
32473161, In view of the extraordinary efforts underway to identify existing medications that are active against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies, any of which may have community-level effects, we also describe how pharmaceutical interventions affect transmission.Copyright © 2020.

32473082, Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses, and had a wider distribution in Korea.
32473082, Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species.
32473082, Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co-roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats.This article is protected by copyright.

32473049, Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R0 is sensitive to the applied mean generation time.
32473049, To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to estimate R0 number in Qom.
32473049, To control the epidemic, the number of reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the contact rate, decreasing transmission probability and decreasing the duration of the infectious period.This article is protected by copyright.

32472991, As far as infection pathophysiology is still not completely clarified, this review focuses also on the cardiovascular (CV) implication of COVID-19 and the capability of this virus to cause direct myocardial injury, myocarditis and other CV manifestations.
32472991, Furthermore, we highlight the relationship between the virus, enzyme ACE2 and ACE inhibitors.
32472991, Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
32472991, Aim of this review is then to summarize what is actually known about the SARS-CoV2 and its cardiovascular implications.
32472974, Dental professionals are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to occupational hazard associated with aerosol generating dental procedures (Ge et al., 2020).
32472974, In this commentary, we share the perspectives of dentists practicing in private practice and clinician-researchers in academic dental institutions.
32472974, More specifically, we discuss about measures implemented to minimize risks of disease transmission, challenges in emergency dental care, impact on patients, and on private practice and academic dental team.This article is protected by copyright.

32472939, We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission.
32472939, As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising.
32472939, However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
32472939, These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.
32472936, However, the association between temperature and transmission is small and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.© The Author(s) 2020.

32472897, In addition, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) are even more exposed, due to increased contact with the population in hospitals and emergency services.
32472897, OMFS should be able to identify a suspected case of COVID-19, its symptoms, risk groups, disease severity, laboratorial and computed tomography alterations, and treatment guidelines.
32472897, In the present study, the authors performed a nationwide survey with Brazilian OMFS to evaluate the knowledge of these professionals about the pandemic status of the COVID-19.
32472897, A total of 142 OMFS replied the survey and the results brings light to an incomparable health public problem that the OMFS in Brazil are no able to protect itself, diagnose the suspicious and probable cases, request and interpret the correct laboratorial examinations for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients.
32472745, We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; one study (a non-peer-reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in milk.
32472745, Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk.
32472745, These reports are evaluated here, and their implications related to the possibility of vertical transmission of coronaviruses (in particular, SARS-CoV-2) during breastfeeding are discussed.© 2020 The Authors.

32472685, The trocar system was effective for posterior surgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures, and afforded a superior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches.
32472685, Aerosolization was reduced using both the mask and nasal trocar.The ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a critical role in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era.
32472685, The nasal trocar may be a useful alternative in instances where 3D printing is not available.

32472347, A comparable data was also obtained from 131 children and adolescents who were not quarantined.Most of the children and adolescents were non-compliant as compliance with all requirements was low (7.43%), though compliance with community protective measures (17.35%) was better than compliance with household protective measures (10.71%).
32472347, Quarantined children and adolescents experienced greater psychological distress than non-quarantined children and adolescents (p ˂0.001).
32472347, Worry (68.59%), helplessness (66.11%) and fear (61.98%) were the most common feelings experienced under quarantine.The low compliance with quarantine requirements as seen in this study raises a serious concern about the effectiveness of quarantine as a preventive measure of disease transmission.
32472347, Compliance and mental health problems can be improved by providing adequate financial support and enhanced knowledge about pandemic planning.
32472043, Environmental sampling is conducted in three airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the general ward. 245 surface samples are collected. 56.7% of rooms have at least one environmental surface contaminated.
32472043, High touch surface contamination is shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p = 0.01, χ2 test).
32472043, Air sampling is performed in three of the 27 AIIRs in the general ward, and detects SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles of sizes >4 µm and 1-4 µm in two rooms, despite these rooms having 12 air changes per hour.
32472043, This warrants further study of the airborne transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2.
32471856, Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States.
32471856, Moreover, we find evidence for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different neighborhoods of the city.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

32471829, Moreover, the high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals make wet-lab studies currently challenging.
32471829, In this study, we used a series of computational strategies to identify several fast-evolving regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which are potentially under host immune pressure.
32471829, Most notably, the hitherto-uncharacterized protein encoded by ORF8 is one of them.
32471829, Using sensitive sequence and structural analysis methods, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-coronavirus comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential immune modulators to delay or attenuate the host immune response against the viruses.Copyright © 2020 Tan et al.
32471302, While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown.
32471302, Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies.
32471302, We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals.
32471302, We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.
32471203, COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32471203, As SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, we cannot ignore the risk of transmission during hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
32471203, Our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center prioritizes preventing the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining operation for the patients during the pandemic.
32471203, The aim of this article is to share the protocol that we have adopted in our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32470888, However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
32470888, Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
32470888, According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.Copyright © 2020.

32470088, Overall approximately one third of respondents had significant psychological impact (IES-R score > 24).
32470088, Higher psychological impact was predicted with younger age, female gender and comorbid physical illness.
32470088, Presence of physical symptoms and contact history predicted higher psychological impact, but did not reach statistical significance.During the initial stages of COVID-19 in India, almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact.
32470088, This indicates a need for more systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs of the population, which can help the government in formulating holistic interventions for affected individuals.
32468509,The scarcity of facemasks, particularly N95 respirators, combined with the lack of solid data to address the suitability of each mask type for adequate health care worker (HCW) protection have caused turmoil among HCWs.
32468509, Current recommendations suggest mask usage solely during HCW contact with Covid-19 patients, namely plain medical mask for low-risk contacts and N95 for aerosol generating procedures.
32468509, The distinction regarding the escalation of mask complexity depending on contact type is nevertheless based on plausible theoretical assumptions rather than hard evidence of a clear benefit.
32468509, Conversely, we suggest that at least a plain mask should be used during all HCWs' contacts in healthcare facilities which constitute a highly probable but often overlooked means of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs.
32468343, First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing Rt.
32468343, Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation.
32468343, Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life.
32468343, Our mathematical modeling provides evidence for international communities to develop sound design of containment and mitigation policies for COVID-19.
32468014, Despite the very fast and large flow of scientific data on possible treatment solutions, none have yet demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
32468014, This work represents an exhaustive and critical review of all available data on potential treatments for COVID‑19, highlighting their mechanistic characteristics and the strategy development rationale.
32468014, Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, and target based methods are the most used strategies to advance therapeutic solutions into clinical practice.
32468014, Current in silico, in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding proposed treatments are summarized providing strong support for future research efforts.
32466392, Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care.
32466392, MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments.
32466392, For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment.
32466392, The indications proposed in this protocol could support clinicians for the temporary management of ECC until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends.
32464670, For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
32464670, After the initial rollout and several "hygiene inspections" only minor improvements to the concept were necessary.
32464670, All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.
32464670, Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a dynamic process with regular changes in the development and information status, the operational concept is regularly reviewed for validity and adjusted as necessary.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32464409, The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 °C and 8.48 mm respectively).
32464409, Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season.
32464409, In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).Copyright © 2020.

32464297, Despite the fact that COVID-19 rarely caused any severe disease in children, the asymptomatic children might be playing an important role for spreading COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.
32464297, This review aimed at sharing our experience of how to handle patients with COVID-19 in a pediatric referral and tertiary care hospital to prevent the possible transmissions to the healthcare workers (HCWs).This review sought to identify infection control practices measures during COVID-19 pandemic comes from our daily practice combined with the most recent guidelines with the new experience and information.Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, four primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment.Infection control precautions to prevent the possible transmissions to HCWs as well as the other patients and their caregivers from children with COVID-19 are very critical.

32462701, There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32462701, These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease.
32462701, Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.This article is protected by copyright.

32462468, The pathology of COVID-19, including the exact infection route, remains largely unknown.
32462468, Given the unavailability of an effective cure and vaccine, people are required to respond to this adversity without becoming complacent.
32462468, The global efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing endeavors, far from over.
32462468, New epidemiological data and clinical findings are emerging on a daily basis, making it critical to always refer to the latest information.
32462098, Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed.
32462098, Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak.
32462098, Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested.

32461068, The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003.Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
32461068, Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak.
32461068, The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p<0.001).Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020.

32461062, In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown.
32461062, This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone.A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections.
32461062, This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.Copyright © 2020.

32460383,The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heralded a new era in the cross-species transmission of severe respiratory illness leading to rapid spread in mainland China and around the world with a case fatality rate of 2.3% in China and 1.8-7.2% outside China (Wu & McGoogan, 2019; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Onder Rezza, & Brusaferro, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).
32460383, As of May 15, 2020, a total of 4,338,658 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 297,119 death cases have been documented globally (World Health Organization, 2020).

32459668, For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed.
32459668, Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team.
32459668, If possible after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of healthcare worker infection.Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high-risk for all members of the procedural team.
32459668, To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.
32459186, Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23.
32459186, Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
32459186, Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation.Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety.These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders.
32459186, Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.
32459123, Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace.
32459123, In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients.
32459123, In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state.
32459123, Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
32459061,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed health care, challenged by resource constraints and fears of transmission.
32459061, We report the surgical practice pattern changes in a Head and Neck Surgery department of a tertiary cancer care center and discuss the issues surrounding multidisciplinary care during the pandemic.We report data regarding outpatient visits, multidisciplinary treatment planning conference, surgical caseload, and modifications of oncologic therapy during this pandemic and compared this data to the same interval last year.We found a 46.7% decrease in outpatient visits and a 46.8% decrease in surgical caseload, compared to 2019.
32459061, We discuss the factors involved in the decision-making process and perioperative considerations.Surgical practice patterns in head and neck oncologic surgery will continue to change with the evolving pandemic.

32458787,Globally, more than 4 million people have been infected with COVID-19, and more than 300,000 deaths have been reported across 188 countries.
32458787, Concealment of one's potential exposure to the virus has negative implications for the spread of COVID-19 across the socio-ecological spectrum, including the futility of contact-tracing efforts, exposure of frontline staff, and the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
32458787, We draw lessons learned from HIV to discuss stigma and the attribution of blame surrounding the phenomenon of concealment of one's potential exposure to COVID-19 using a socio-ecological perspective.
32458787, This article also illustrates the psychosocial aspect of the disease, and the negative repercussions of concealment of potential exposure on transmission in the community and to front-liners, healthcare resources, and outbreak containment.
32458712, The urine sample was still positive for Covid 19 despite respiratory swabs being negative.
32458712, There is a potential concern therefore that Endourologists who generally perform a high number of urine prone procedures could be at risk of exposure to the virus peri operatively.
32458712, There is still confusion as to the type of PPE Endourologists should use and in what circumstances.
32458712, Until it is proven that urine is not a potential source for transmission of the Virus Endourologists should have a clear knowledge of the different types of PPE available and what they should use when performing procedures.
32458598, Malaria was once widely epidemic in China.
32458598, Nevertheless, the local transmission of this parasitic disease has been interrupted in China since the launch of the national malaria elimination programme in 2010, and great successes have been achieved in the management of appropriately 3 thousand malaria cases imported from other countries and territories annually.
32458598, Hereby, the epidemiological characteristics and current epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China were analyzed and compared with malaria.
32458598, Based on the successful experiences from the management of overseas imported malaria in China, the strategy and countermeasures for COVID-19 control were proposed, so as to provide insights into the response to the importation of COVID-19 from other countries and territories and the consolidation of the control achievements in China.
32458289, This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy.A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications.Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50.
32458289, Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy.
32458289, SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol.If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
32458289, Evidence-based research in this field is needed for definitive determination of safety.
32456959, Research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through close contact via respiratory droplets, but there is the possibility for ocular transmission, with the conjunctiva as a conduit as well as a source of infection.Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis, and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19-positive patients.
32456959, Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears, based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
32456959, The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites.All health care professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, and use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks by both the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32456560, NETCCN capabilities should be maintained between disasters and regularly tested to ensure continual readiness.Conclusions:COVID-19 has demonstrated the impact of a large-scale health emergency on the existing infrastructures.
32456560, Short term, an approach to meeting this challenge is to adopt existing digital health technologies.
32456560, Long term, developing a NETCCN may ensure that the necessary ecosystem is available to respond to future emergencies.
32456346, Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13-0.88), respectively.
32456346, A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin.
32456346, In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January.
32456346, Our results highlighted more efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors.
32455859, To date, despite no universal guidelines are available for dental procedures in pediatric dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak, routine dental practice should be postponed and only severe dental emergencies must be treated.
32455859, In the case of a dental emergency, involving a pediatric patient, dentists should be aware of which recommended management protocol can be adopted during the practice to protect patient health, to safeguard their-self and to prevent viral transmission.
32455859, The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol.
32455859, Pediatric dentists should keep a high level of awareness to help patients, minimize risk and prevent viral spread.
32455057, Conclusions Knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCWs regarding the use of face masks were found to be inadequate.
32455057, Studied HCWs had a positive attitude but moderate-to-poor level of knowledge and practice regarding the use of face mask.
32455057, HCWs and general public awareness campaigns regarding the proper use of face mask by utilizing all social media available resources would be helpful during this pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Kumar et al.
32454807, Minor, non-specific changes in biochemical variables were reported.
32454807, Studies that tested breast milk reported negative SARS-CoV-2 results.Given the paucity of studies at this time, vertical transmission cannot be confirmed or denied.
32454807, Current literature does not support abstaining from breastfeeding nor separating mothers and newborns.
32454807, Further evidence and data collection networks, particularly in the Americas, are needed for establishing definitive guidelines and recommendations.
32454806, South Korea employed technology and the holistic education of its physician community, despite having a smaller proportion of physicians in society, to its advantage by implementing efficacious drive-through centers that test suspected individuals rapidly and with little to no contact with healthcare staff, decreasing the possibility of transmission of COVID-19.
32454806, Conversely, Italy is presently considered the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe and has recorded the highest death toll of any country outside of mainland China.
32454806, This is partially due to the reactionary nature of Italy's public health measures compared to South Korea's proactive response.
32454806, The different healthcare responses of South Korea and Italy can inform decisions made by public health bodies in other countries, especially in countries across the Americas, which can selectively adopt policies that have worked in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and learn from mistakes made by both countries.
32454575, Eye care providers should prioritize patient care in order of absolute necessity, such as sudden vision loss, sudden onset flashes and floaters, and eye trauma.
32454575, In those cases, exposure should be minimized.
32454575, The close proximity between eye care providers and their patients during slit-lamp examination may require further precautions, such as shields, barriers, and mask use to lower the risk of transmission via droplets or through hand to eye contact.All nonemergent eye care appointments should be delayed or conducted remotely.
32454575, For emergent in-person appointments, careful and appropriate adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations may minimize exposure for both the health care provider and patient.Copyright © 2020 Frontline Medical Communications Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA.
32454574, The transmission and virulence of this new pathogen has raised concern for how best to protect operating room staff while effectively providing care to the infected patient requiring urgent or emergent surgery.Establishment of a clear protocol that adheres to rigorous infection control measures while providing a safe system for interfacility transport and operative care is vital to a successful surgical pandemic response.
32454574, While emergency protocols must be rapidly developed, they should be collaboratively improved and incorporate new knowledge as and when it becomes available.
32454574, These measures combined with practice drills to keep operating room personnel ready and able should help construct processes that are useful, easy to follow, and tailored to the unique local environment of each health care setting.After the initial apprehensions and struggles during our confrontation with the COVID-19 crisis, it is our hope that the experience we share will be helpful to surgical staff at other institutions grappling with the challenges of operative care in the pandemic environment.
32454574, While this protocol focuses on the current COVID-19 pandemic, these recommendations serve as a template for surgical preparedness that can be readily adapted to infectious disease crisis that unfortunately might emerge in the future.Copyright © 2020 Frontline Medical Communications Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA.
32454456, We suggest pragmatic options for screening of GDM in a pandemic setting based on blood tests, and risk calculators applied to underlying risk factors.
32454456, Alternative models for antenatal care provision for women with GDM, including targeting high-risk groups, early lifestyle interventions and remote monitoring are provided.
32454456, Testing options and their timing for postpartum screening in women who had GDM are also considered.
32454456, Our suggestions are only applicable in a pandemic scenario; usual guidelines and care pathways should be re-implemented as soon as possible and appropriate.
32454253, There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches.
32454253, Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.
32454253, Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.Copyright © 2020.

32453656, We have developed guidelines at our academic cancer center to standardize management of patients with lung cancer across our health care system and provide guidance to the larger oncology community.
32453656, We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression.
32453656, We recognize that our recommendations may change over time based on clinical resources and the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32453656, In principle, however, treatment paradigms must continue to be individualized, with careful consideration of risks and benefits of continuing or altering lung cancer-directed therapy.
32452978, Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects models.Four studies reporting data from 36 children were included.
32452978, A higher proportion of children had viral shedding in stools after 14 days of symptoms onset compared to respiratory samples (RR= 3.2, 95%CI 1.2 to 8.9, I2 = 51%).
32452978, Viral RNA shedding was longer in fecal samples with a mean difference of approximately 9 days (Mean Difference = 8.6, 95%CI 1.7 to 15.4, I2 = 77%) compared with respiratory samples.SARS-CoV-2 shedding seems to be present in feces for a longer time than in the respiratory tract of children.
32452978, Although fecal SARS-CoV-2 presence in feces do not confirm its transmissibility, the high and fast spread of the COVID-19 disease worldwide indicate other transmission routes are also plausible.
32452954, The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).
32452954, Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list.
32452954, The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately.
32452954, The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.
32452819, N-95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites.
32452819, Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% and 27.4% sites, respectively.
32452819, The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, were significantly disrupted (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic.Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures.
32452819, Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policymakers and health managers working at primary healthcare facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.IEC Clearance F.1/IEC/MAMC/(73/01/2020/No68).
32452739, Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (P < .05).
32452739, Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread.Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 μm under surgical conditions.
32452739, During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing.
32452739, Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.
32452648, We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the exponential growth to estimate the reproduction number.Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated mean SI at 5.9 days (95%CI: 3.9-9.6) and a standard deviation (SD) at 4.8 days (95%CI: 3.1-10.1).
32452648, Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen at 2.6 (95%CI: 2.4-2.8).The SI of COVID-19 is relative shorter than that of SARS and MERS, other two beta coronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission was rapid.

32452539, The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
32452539, Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
32452539, This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.

32452195, COVID-19 infection is an indication for delivery if necessary to improve maternal oxygenation.
32452195, Decision on delivery mode should be individualised.
32452195, Vertical transmission of coronavirus from the pregnant woman to the fetus has not been proven.
32452195, As the virus is absent in breast milk, the experts encourage breastfeeding for neonatal acquisition of protective antibodies.
32452050, SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction.
32452050, There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered.
32452050, Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic.
32452050, In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

32450770, Powered air-purifying respirators and N95 masks were used mainly for procedures involving the mucosal surfaces.Due to the high viral density in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19, basic examinations and common otolaryngology procedures place practitioners at high risk of exposure.
32450770, Although there is variability in practice among otolaryngologists across North America in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, most are primarily seeing urgent ambulatory and inpatient consultations.
32450770, Most are also incorporating personal protective equipment appropriate to the level of transmission across mucous membranes.In these rapidly evolving times, it is helpful to find solidarity and assurance among health care providers.
32450770, Current data aimed to provide (1) perceived methods regarding the safe care of otolaryngology patients and (2) updated practice patterns at a national level.
32450712, Although the highest number of new cases per 1 million people in China was 9.8 on February 28, 2020; it was 108.4 on March 21, 2020, in Italy; and this was 16.6 on March 5, 2020, in South Korea.
32450712, On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey.
32450712, The log-cubic model proposed in this study has been set forth to obtain successful results for aforementioned countries, as well as to estimate the course of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32450712, Other factors such as climacteric factors and genetic differences, which may have an impact on viral spreading and transmission, would also have strengthened the model prediction capacity.

32449614, Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators.
32449614, The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.
32449614, Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes.
32449614, Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.
32447820, The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications.
32447820, With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope.

32447746, Such central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms linked to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is often life threatening.
32447746, Health care providers currently evaluating patients with neurologic symptoms need consider COVID-19 in any differential diagnosis.
32447746, These considerations will facilitate prompt testing, isolation and prevention of viral transmission speeding best clinical outcomes.
32447746, Graphical Abstract.
32447742, It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32447742, Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32447742, Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
32447742, Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32447007, In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions.From the data available we propose a "double-hit hypothesis": chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression.
32447007, This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences.
32447007, High atmospheric NO2 may provide a second hit causing a severe form of SARS-CoV-19 in ACE-2 depleted lungs resulting in a worse outcome.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32446866, Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering.
32446866, This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration.
32446866, A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.Copyright © 2020.

32446538, The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic.
32446538, In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.Copyright © 2020 IMSS.

32445710, When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts.
32445710, Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number <1).Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts.

32445330, Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission.
32445330, Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.
32445330, The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges.
32445330, However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.
32445134, Conjunctivitis is not a common manifestation of the disease, but contact with infected eyes could be one route of transmission.
32445134, Consequently, ophthalmologists need to have correct prevention strategies in place.
32445134, Some guidelines regarding the prevention and management of ophthalmology clinics are reviewed.
32445134, However, well-designed trials should be conducted to rule out other ocular manifestations that may result from COVID-19 infection and to understand the transmission of the virus through the eyes.
32444876, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly transmitted among naive hACE2 mice via close contact because 7/13 naive hACE2 mice were SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seropositivity on 14 days after introduced into the same cage with 3 infected-hACE2 mice.
32444876, For respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from 3/10 naive hACE2 mice showed seropositivity on 14 days after introduced into the grids separated same cage from 3 infected-hACE2 mice.

32444569, Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, before delivery, allows their management through dedicated protocols and minimizes the risk of contagion for other patients and healthcare providers.
32444569, Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded at present, and should be ruled out as soon as possible after birth.
32444569, Rooming in of infected mothers and neonates, provided their good clinical conditions, is not contraindicated based on current knowledge.

32443023, Pediatric patients present a unique challenge as they may have minimal symptoms and yet transmit disease.
32443023, Endoscopists face risk for infection with viruses like SARS-CoV-2, as the aerosol generating nature of endoscopy diffuses respiratory disease that can be spread via an airborne and droplet route.
32443023, We describe our center's methodology for pediatric patient risk stratification to facilitate responsible use of endoscopic resources during this crisis.
32443023, We also describe our recommendations for use of personal protective equipment by endoscopists, with the goal of ensuring the safety of ourselves, our anesthesiology and endoscopy staff, and our patients.
32443022, In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk.
32443022, To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures).
32443022, This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide.
32443022, It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.
32442720, In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2.
32442720, This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19.
32442720, Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32442427, An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible due to many unknown and complex factors.
32442427, However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.Copyright © 2020 American College of Radiology.

32442333, Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in all provinces across China.
32442333, In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID-19 incubation period.
32442333, Moreover, if the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%.Although the risk is low, with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 and the appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and a high fatality rate, appropriate measures should be taken by health departments to ensure the safety of clinical blood.© 2020 The Authors.

32442265, The median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 13 days, compared to 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT (p < 0.05).A portion of these asymptomatic individuals, with and without abnormal chest CT scans, were capable of transmitting the virus to others.
32442265, Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential.

32442210, Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat.
32442210, The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
32442210, There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
32442210, Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32442131, However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-square tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-square test.We reanalyze the data from the city of Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.We excluded the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopted a more appropriate statistical method, including the permutation test and the Fisher exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo.After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, the Fisher exact test yields a P value of .84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis.
32442131, The odds ratio of the coronavirus transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval 0.5-2.8.Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we concluded that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.©Guosheng Yin, Huaqing Jin.

32442035, A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
32442035, Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
32442035, Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
32442035, Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.World Health Organization.

32441209,Older adults residing in long-term care facilities are especially vulnerable for severe illness or death from COVID-19.
32441209, To contain the transmission of the virus in long-term care facilities, federal health officials have issued strict visitation guidelines, restricting most visits between residents and all visitors, including family members.
32441209, Yet, many older adults rely on family care for social support and to maintain their health, well-being, and safety in long-term care facilities, and therefore need to stay connected to their families.
32441209, The federal government, state and local leaders, and long-term care facilities should take further actions to enable the relationship between residents of long-term care facilities and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32440660, No case of maternal death was reported up to the time the studies were published. 79 mothers delivered their babies by cesarean section and five women had a vaginal delivery.
32440660, No fetal infection through intrauterine vertical transmission was reported.Available data showed that pregnant patients in late pregnancy had clinical manifestations similar to non-pregnant adults.
32440660, It appears that the risk of fetal distress, preterm delivery and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) rises with the onset of COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy.
32440660, There is also no evidence of intrauterine and transplacental transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancies.

32438898, The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships.
32438898, The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports.
32438898, Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases.
32438898, Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.© Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.
32438868, According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR reports were detected as positive by ddPCR.
32438868, The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively.
32438868, Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR, which still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 5-12 days post discharge.
32438868, Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.
32438824, Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32438824, Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses.
32438824, In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance, but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited.Our objective was to estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission.We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1,062 locations from 1990 to 2019.Despite overall improvements from 1990 {33.6% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 31.5, 35.6] without access} to 2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (95% UI: 1.91, 2.14) billion people, 26.1% (95% UI: 24.7, 27.7) of the global population, lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water.
32438824, More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, and in eight countries, 50 million or more persons lacked access.For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, and disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7200.
32438622,The novel Coronavirus 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has surprised health authorities around the world, quickly producing a global health crisis.
32438622, Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
32438622, In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat.
32438622, In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications.

32437513, A reliable laboratory assay is essential both to confirm suspected patients and to exclude patients infected with other respiratory viruses, thereby facilitating the control of global outbreak scenarios.In this review, we focus on the genomic, transmission and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for SARS-CoV-2.
32437513, We also explore the quality assurance measures for these assays.SARS-CoV-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects, including the design of primers, the selection of specimens and testing strategies at different disease stages.
32437513, Appropriate quality assurance measures for molecular and serological assays are needed to maintain testing proficiency.
32437513, Because serological assays have the potential to identify later stages of the infection and to confirm highly suspected cases with negative molecular assay results, a combination of these two assays is needed to achieve a reliable capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2.© 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
32437432, The majority, 170(68.8%), felt self-efficacious to controlling COVID-19. 207(83.3%) believed that COVID-19 is a stigmatized disease.
32437432, Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices.
32437432, Knowledge status and self-efficacy (positively), older age, and unemployment (negatively) predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking.The status of knowledge and desirable practices were not sufficient enough to combat this rapidly spreading virus.
32437432, COVID-19 risk communication and public education efforts should focus on building an appropriate level of knowledge while enhancing the adoption of recommended self-care practices with special emphasis on high-risk audience segments.
32437338, During contact tracing, at least 26 additional persons with confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among community members who reported contact with church A attendees and likely were infected by them; one of the additional persons was hospitalized and subsequently died.
32437338, This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, both at group gatherings during church events and within the broader community.
32437338, These findings underscore the opportunity for faith-based organizations to prevent COVID-19 by following local authorities' guidance and the U.S.

32434402, The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level.
32434402, Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans.
32434402, Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed.COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world.
32434402, Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32434337, Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found.
32434337, Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes.
32434337, The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities.
32434337, Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.
32434289, The patient was transported to operating theatre with supplemental oxygen over a face mask and plastic covering over the trolley.
32434289, Rapid sequence intubation was performed by an experienced anesthetist using a videolaryngoscope.
32434289, After surgery, the patient remained intubated to avoid re-intubation due to initial presentation of respiratory distress.
32434289, Droplet, contact and airborne infection precautions were instituted.Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimising risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.
32434145, However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing.The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks.Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (β) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks.
32434145, Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and β values.Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates.Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
32434145, In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.©Dursun Delen, Enes Eryarsoy, Behrooz Davazdahemami.

32433799,Since the first cases in Wuhan, China, during the month of December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) evolved into a worldwide emergency, becoming one of the deadliest pandemics of modern history.
32433799, As we write, the outbreak has led to 3,595,662 confirmed cases and 247,652 deaths worldwide1 . SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the disease, is a single-stranded RNA virus which can cause a wide clinical spectrum of symptoms.
32433799, According to the available knowledge, a large but still unknown percentage of the infected patients remains asymptomatic, representing an important and insidious vehicle of transmission2 . According to the largest case series to date, most of the symptomatic patients complain of a mild respiratory syndrome (81%), while approximately 14% develop a severe disease requiring hospitalization and a further 5% need intensive care3 .This article is protected by copyright.

32433343, However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients.
32433343, In addition to the high risk of cluster infection and compromised immunity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), an atypical disease presentation could also make the medial system neglect these patients during CVOID-19 pandemic.
32433343, To avoid COVID-19 transmission among dialysis patients, the major societies of nephrology around the world have provided their guidelines of screening, dialysis facilities adjustment, and health education, respectively.
32433343, In this review, we summarized the main contents and difference of these guidelines and addressed the prompt management for ESRD patients to reduce the risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.
32433293, There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context.A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation.
32433293, After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada.The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage.
32433293, Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point.The situation with COVID-19 is an opportunity to re-evaluate operating room protocols both for the purposes of this pandemic and similar situations in the future.
32433293, In the context of lung resection surgery, specific time points during the procedure seem to pose specific risks for the genesis of aerosol and thus should be the focus of attention.
32433285, International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action.We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches.
32433285, We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution.While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case.
32433285, A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large.
32433285, Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.
32433226, Furthermore, pathological features have not been clear.
32433226, Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited.
32433226, However, diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases, particularly in newborns and infants.
32433226, It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.
32433010, We urgently need to find treatment and vaccine to stop the epidemic.
32433010, Vaccine development is in progress, but any approved and effective vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 12 to 18 months.
32433010, The World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have issued instructions and strategies for containing COVID-19 outbreak to the general public, physicians, travelers and injured patients to follow so that the transmission to a healthy population can be prevented.

32432015, This case highlights the milder presentation of COVID-19 in otherwise healthy, full-term neonates.
32432015, COVID-19 must be considered in the evaluation of a febrile infant.
32432015, Infants and children may play an important role in the transmission of COVID-19 in the community.
32432015, Hence, with an understanding of the transmission patterns, parents and caregivers would be better equipped to limit the spread of the virus and protect the more vulnerable population.Copyright © 2020, Dumpa et al.

32431273, Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries.
32431273, Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to "unlock" or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. "Precision physical distancing"-distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings-is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19.
32431273, It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures.
32431273, Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.
32431118, As of mid-April over 2 million people have been infected with over 145 thousand casualties.
32431118, The disease is more severe in the older population, whereas in children lower infection rates and milder symptoms are more common.
32431118, Severe symptoms in the pediatric population, although uncommon, have been reported mainly in infants younger than 1 year of age.
32431118, Perinatal transmission is infrequent and associated with a relatively mild illness in the newborn.
32431085, This review highlights the articles reporting rigorous estimates and determinants of COVID-19 R0 for the most affected areas.
32431085, Moreover, the mean of all estimated R0 with median and interquartile range is calculated.
32431085, According to these articles, the basic reproduction number of the virus epicentre Wuhan has now declined below the important threshold value of 1.0 since the disease emerged.

32430964, Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks.
32430964, However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.Children are unlikely to be the main drivers of the pandemic.
32430964, Opening up schools and kindergartens is unlikely to impact COVID-19 mortality rates in older people.This article is protected by copyright.

32430957, From the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported.Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good-quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID-19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications.
32430957, In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses through meaningful good-quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into a registry or several registries.

32430840, Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period.
32430840, This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control.
32430840, Such a "schedule" of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable.
32430840, Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.
32429786, A natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia in the adult population was presented, as well.Conclusion: Currently, no evidence of vertical transmission has been suggested at least in late pregnancy.
32429786, No hazards have been detected for fetuses or neonates.
32429786, Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.
32429450, A transmission dynamics model fitted to the cumulative case time series data permits us to estimate the effectiveness of interventions implemented in terms of the contact rate, probability of transmission per contact, proportion of isolated contacts, and detection rate.
32429450, This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one).
32429450, From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound.
32429450, From this, we quantify the conditions needed to prevent epidemic rebound during de-escalation by simply reversing the escalation process.
32428385, The first two authors produced a draft, based on analysis of the current government guidance and the application of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework to identify and evaluate the options.For promoting social distancing, 10 options were identified for improving adherence.
32428385, They covered improvements in ways of achieving the BCW intervention types of education, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion.
32428385, For promoting shielding of vulnerable people, four options were identified covering the BCW intervention types of incentivization, coercion, and enablement.Responding to policymakers very rapidly as has been necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by using a framework to structure the thinking and reporting of multidisciplinary academics and policymakers.© 2020 The Authors.

32428372, By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols are produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management.
32428372, Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa.
32428372, This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID-19, in the post-pandemic era.This article is protected by copyright.

32428112,This article presents expert recommendations for assisting newborn children of mothers with suspected or diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 </mac_aq>(COVID-19).
32428112, The consensus was developed by five experts with an average of 20 years of experience in neonatal intensive care working at a reference university hospital in Brazil for the care of pregnant women and newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
32428112, Despite the lack of scientific evidence regarding the potential for viral transmission to their fetus in pregnant mothers diagnosed with or suspected of COVID-19, it is important to elaborate the lines of care by specialists from hospitals caring for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to guide multidisciplinary teams and families diagnosed with the disease or involved in the care of pregnant women and newborns in this context.
32428112, Multidisciplinary teams must be attentive to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 so that decision-making is oriented and assertive for the management of the mother and newborn in both the hospital setting and at hospital discharge.
32428085, However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room.
32428085, In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects.
32428085, Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice.
32428085, However, they still need to be validated by future studies.
32428031, The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%).
32428031, Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases).
32428031, Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals).Work-related transmission is considerable in early COVID-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW.
32428031, Implementing preventive/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.
32427569, HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members.
32427569, Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., "already protected", the ones in the acute phase, i.e., "the infectious", and the virus-naive, i.e., "at risk" workers.
32427569, Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

32427227, With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s.
32427227, Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered.
32427227, Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32426755, But in the face of an emerging pandemic threat, it is crucial that we start to apply these principles to the clinic, the emergency department, and the hospital ward.
32426755, We propose that this dynamic situation calls for a parallel "Clinical Distancing" in which we as a medical culture go against many of our fundamental instincts and, at least in the short term, begin to reduce unnecessary patient-care contacts for the benefit of our patients and our ability to continue to provide care to those who need it most.

32425663, Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM.
32425663, However, these cases arise from maternal infection close to childbirth and there are no information about exposition during first or second trimester of pregnancy.

32425658, However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
32425658, Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
32425658, According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.Copyright © 2020.

32425637, Participants were asked how often they implemented the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys.The prevalence of 3 of the 5 personal protective measures significantly improved in the community transmission phase compared to the early phase.
32425637, Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%).
32425637, Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed, men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households.The prevalence of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving, however there is potential for improvement, especially in regard to avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth.© 2020 The Author(s).

32425007, However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020).
32425007, It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies.
32425007, Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19.
32425007, In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.
32425001, The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions.
32425001, Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission.
32425001, Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice.
32425001, In addition to the standard precautions, some special precautions that should be implemented during an outbreak have been raised in this review.
32424329, Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32424329, The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis.
32424329, All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results.Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.
32424329, Therefore, possibility of ocular transmission should be considered even in the absence of ocular manifestations.
32424327, Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR.
32424327, The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial.
32424327, However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures.
32424327, SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.
32423996, A preliminary analysis of non-pharmaceutical control measures indicates that they may moderate the pandemic-climate interaction via susceptible depletion.

32423338, Smoke was passed through the cadaver head, and images were taken with a high-resolution camera in a standardized manner.
32423338, Digital image processing was used to calculate relative amounts of small-particle escape from a variety of masks, including a standard surgical mask, a modified Ambu mask, and our negative airway pressure respirator (NAPR).Significant amounts of aerosolized particles escaped during the trials with no mask, a standard surgical mask, and the NAPR without suction.
32423338, When suction was applied to the NAPR, creating a negative-pressure system, no particle escape was noted.We present a new and effective method for the study of small-particle aerosols as a step toward better understanding the spread of these particles and the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019.
32423338, We also present the concept of an NAPR to better protect health care workers from aerosols generated from the upper and lower airways.
32423299, However, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, DFL represents a high-risk procedure for patients and otolaryngologists due to the risk of aerosolization.
32423299, In cases where DFL is required, in patients with COVID-19 positivity or unknown COVID-19 status, we describe the use of a modified endoscopy face mask as an adjunct to personal protection equipment to reduce occupational transmission of COVID-19 while performing DFL.
32423299, Our modified endoscopy mask provides an additional barrier against the transmission of airborne pathogens.
32423299, The modified endoscopy face mask may also serve as a useful tool for otolaryngologists as they return to performing more aerosol-generating procedures in the outpatient setting.
32423283, Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, <1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, <1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, <1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter.
32423283, The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm).Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from routine rhinologic procedures.
32423283, The droplet generation from drilling was mitigated with the use of concurrent suction.
32423283, Extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, which was found to cause droplet contamination.
32422545, Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed.
32422545, Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen.

32422201, Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0-99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2-32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6-8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.
32422201, Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred.

32422180, In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.
32422180, We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.
32422180, By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32422057, On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%).
32422057, This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21.Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based.Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission.
32422057, If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins Health System, and U.S.

32421686, Tweets were mainly focused on actions and recommendations (28%) needed to control the pandemic.
32421686, Many tweets warned about misleading information (20%) which could lead to more cases infected with the virus.
32421686, Other tweets discussed general Knowledge and information (9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the healthcare systems and workers (9%).
32421686, The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (8%), immunity (7%), testing (6%), and virus infection and transmission (5%).Findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms could help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during the pandemic outbreak.
32421541, Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus.
32421541, This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy.
32421541, Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32421089, However, such a strategy can have prohibitive economic and social costs and, therefore, will be difficult to implement.
32421089, At the same time, the current situation is leading to an expanding humanitarian, health and economic crisis.
32421089, Based on principles of the Theory of Constraints, we propose in this article the "Shutting-down Transmission Of Pandemic" (STOP Covid-19) plan that would reliably contain the pandemic, mitigate its economic consequences, and boost societal confidence.
32421089, This plan requires the implementation of four strategies over 90 days: (a) stop all international, domestic passenger air and intercity bus/train travel; (b) create administrative zones of about 1 million people; (c) stop all non-emergency cross-zonal travel except for transportation of goods, and (d) deploy an information-driven service value chain to control the spread of the pandemic within a zone.© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.
32420953, One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread.
32420953, With specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still adopt "classical" preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease.
32420953, Only the future will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic.
32420953, However, what in this epidemiological scenario is already known, is that the multi-century international health value of quarantine remains essential and unavoidable.
32420863, It is known that transmission from person to person is the most important way to spread.
32420863, However, due to the widespread host diversity, a detailed examination of the role of animals in this pandemic is essential to effectively fight against the outbreak.
32420863, Although coronavirus infections in pets are known to be predominantly related to the gastrointestinal tract, it has been observed that there are human-to-animal transmissions in this outbreak and some animals have similar symptoms to humans.
32420863, Although animal-to-animal transmission has been shown to be possible, there is no evidence of animal-to-human transmission.
32420674, In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time.
32420674, This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations.
32420674, Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures.
32420674, Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
32419771, SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects.
32419771, In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility.

32419694, Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.
32419694, The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission.
32419694, Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.
32419694, This fact necessitates vigilant awareness in clinical investigation, management, and infection control, especially in tropical resource-limited settings.
32419544, Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific.
32419544, Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32419544, Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters.
32419544, Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.
32419401, Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population.
32419401, The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection.
32419401, The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols.Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients.

32418559, These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures.
32418559, It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections.
32418559, Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed.
32418559, Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.
32418481, Public health response includes a rapid reorganization of the Italian National Healthcare System in order to reduce transmission of COVID-19 within hospitals and healthcare facilities, while optimizing the assistance to patients with severe COVID-19 complications.We analysed the actions that were taken in three ophthalmology centres in northern Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and how these measures affected patient's attendance.
32418481, In addition, due to the rapidly evolving scenario, we reviewed the evidence available during the course of this pandemic.A full reorganization of ophthalmology services is mandatory according to current existing infection containment measures in order to continue dispensing urgent procedures without endangering the community with amplification of the diffusion chain.
32418481, Ophthalmologists are considered at elevated risk of exposure when caring patients and vice versa, due to their close proximity during eye examination.
32418481, High volumes of procedures typically generated by ophthalmologists with concurrent implications on the risk of infection are considered when re-assessing healthcare facilities reorganization.Containment measures in the event of pandemic due to infective agents should be well known by healthcare professionals and promptly applied in order to mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak.
32418307, There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus.There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19.
32418307, Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route.

32418213, Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures.
32418213, Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
32418213, It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.This article is protected by copyright.

32418146, Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3).
32418146, Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines.As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available.
32418146, This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.
32418146, Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.
32418028, All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion.Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period.
32418028, Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission.COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course.
32418028, Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications.
32418028, These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.
32417802, Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2.
32417802, Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial.
32417802, Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection.
32417802, The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.
32417768, The region needs to make strategic plans based on available evidence to enable them effectively deal with this rapidly evolving pandemic.
32417768, At this very moment countries like China, Italy, France, Spain, Iran, UK and many others are witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus and increasing numbers of severe disease and death particularly among elderly patients with other comorbidities.
32417768, The reality of the seriousness of this pandemic is alarming.
32417768, Government of member states of ECOWAS need to prepare themselves by building capacity as well as implement evidenced-based steps to mitigate this rapidly evolving pandemic by testing persons presenting with symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath), isolating and treating those found positive, tracing and quarantining contacts, implementing social distancing as well as optimizing human and material endowment to allow healthcare workers offer safe quality clinical care for affected patients to prevent secondary infection among healthcare workers.
32417744,Owing to the frequent travel connections between Wuhan and Zhejiang, Zhejiang was the third worst-affected province in China with 1,205 cases confirmed before 26 February 2020.
32417744, The transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was monitored in Zhejiang, accounting for the transmissions from imported cases.
32417744, Even though Zhejiang was one of the worst-affected provinces, an interruption of disease transmission (i.e. instantaneous reproduction numbers <1) was observed in early/mid-February after a comprehensive set of interventions combating the outbreak.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32416535, Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America.
32416535, This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected.
32416535, We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model.
32416535, Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.Published by Elsevier B.V.
32416534, Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM10; aerodynamic diameter <10 μm) and fine (PM2.5; aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments.
32416534, In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings.
32416534, It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32416374, The results showed that high quanta emission rates (>100 quanta h-1) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (<1 quantum h-1).
32416374, The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures.
32416374, The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.Copyright © 2020.

32416357, Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19.
32416357, Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.

32415548, Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease.
32415548, According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology.
32415548, The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet.
32415548, There have been no reports of SARS-COV-2 transmission by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes.
32415519, In addition, 61.6% of students stated that a suppression strategy involving tight restrictions need to be applied to being the pandemic under control in Turkey.
32415519, Use can be made of medical students in the transmission of accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415519, Students can be excellent activists on these subjects in countries in which medical education is suspended.
32415519, Measures therefore need to be taken concerning the transmission of up to date and accurate information to medical students.
32415422, Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks.
32415422, We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees.
32415422, As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities.
32415422, Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.
32415348, The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature.Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources.
32415348, Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic.
32415348, To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity.Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.
32415348, This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.
32414996, There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes.
32414996, These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment.
32414996, The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly.
32414996, Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources.These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.
32414708,Approximately 12% to 15% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection require invasive ventilation via endotracheal intubation.
32414708, The key to minimizing risk of disease transmission during this aerosol-generating procedure is careful preparation, which includes having necessary equipment and medications on hand as well as an experienced intubation team who can troubleshoot any unforeseen complications.

32414407, Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles into their environments via body secretions.
32414407, Therefore, otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel in this specialty face a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and must remain vigilant when performing examinations and procedures involving the nose and throat.
32414407, In this article, we share our experiences of the planning and logistics undertaken to provide safe and efficient OHNS practices over the last 2 months, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32414407, We hope that our experiences will serve as pearls for otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel working in institutes that serve large numbers of patients every day, particularly with regard to the sharing of clinical and administrative tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32414076, Molecular clock analyses allowed us to estimate that the BCoV ancestor emerged in the 1940s, and that two geographically distinct lineages diverged from the 1960s-1970s.
32414076, A recombination event in the spike gene (breakpoint at nt 1100) may be at the origin of the genetic divergence sixty years ago.
32414076, Little evidence of genetic mixing between the spatially segregated lineages was found, suggesting that BCoV genetic diversity is a result of a global transmission pathway that occurred during the last century.
32414076, However, we found variation in evolution rates between the European and non-European lineages indicating differences in virus ecology.
32413909, Frequent and typical errors during the virtual boards were recorded and analyzed. Virtual boards provided the means for adequate patient care in spite of social distancing among the medical staff.
32413909, Over a period of 4 weeks, 956 face-to-face contacts were avoided.
32413909, Most errors occurred during first-time participation and concerned audio transmission.
32413909, By muting the microphone of inactive participants, most of these errors could be avoided. Virtual boards for medical staff can be implemented with minimal effort und standard technical gear to slow down the transmission of coronavirus among medical professionals in the hospital setting.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32412918, Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective.
32412918, Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time.
32412918, Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action.First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.
32412918, The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.
32412416, The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers.Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method.
32412416, Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%).RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review.
32412416, Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.©Hanley J Ho, Zoe Xiaozhu Zhang, Zhilian Huang, Aung Hein Aung, Wei-Yen Lim, Angela Chow.

32412415,: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over four million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide.
32412415, A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published in scientific journals, as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination.
32412415, Yet, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is missing.The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the current SARS-CoV-2 full genome data, in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signal, to inform and guide the scientific community.We used maximum likelihood based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments, assembled from GISAID data released between March and April 2020.Although number of high quality full-genomes is growing daily, and recent sequence data released in April contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations.At the present time, studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating.
32412415, Hence, the need for interpreting current reports with caution, and continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.RR2-https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020594.
32412120, What began as a localized outbreak of an epizootic disease has now become a pandemic of unprecedented proportions, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. In South America, as of April 30, 2020, Brazil has the highest number of confirmed cases (n=80 246), followed by Peru (n=36 976) and Ecuador (n=24 934).
32412120, It is important to note that the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South America was announced on February 26, 2020, described as an imported case.

32411315, The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus.
32411315, Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy.
32411315, Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.
32411315, Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.© 2020 The Author(s).
32411271, During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week.
32411271, Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing.In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption.This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing.
32411271, Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings.
32411271, Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic.Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity..
32410333, The difficulty in disease detection and containment has been the long course of COVID-19.
32410333, Current evidence shows an incubation period of up to 14 days post exposure to the virus, and on average most patients first display symptoms on day five after initial exposure.
32410333, More importantly, carriers are contagious even during this preceding asymptomatic incubation phase of the disease.This article is protected by copyright.

32409432, Patient-care activities quickly pivoted to remote touches, preserving continuity through a variety of digital and telephonic modalities.
32409432, As the number of confirmed cases grew, standardizing home-based care became critical to managing high-risk patients, moderating the risk of exposure for healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of community spread through appropriate education on home-based care for exposed or infected individuals.

32408911, However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other.
32408911, Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures.
32408911, However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable.IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission.
32408911, This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.
32408845, A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3.Results - Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice.
32408845, Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks.
32408845, Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown.Interpretation - Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available.
32408845, Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.
32408776, In conclusion, improving quality of care in maternal health, as well as educating, training, and supporting healthcare providers in infection management to be prioritized.
32408776, Sharing data can help to countries that to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with the COVID-19.
32408730, Calling on previous experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during the 2015 outbreak, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy quickly formed a COVID-19 task force team to develop a manual before the first index case was diagnosed in the hemodialysis unit.
32408730, This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within hemodialysis facilities, which were developed to protect patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers from this highly transmissible virus.
32408730, The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.
32408730, We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and hemodialysis patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32408338, Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient.
32408338, Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA.
32408338, Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies.
32408338, Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.
32408337, Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases.
32408337, The animals remained asymptomatic during quarantine.
32408337, The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32408337, It is unclear whether infected dogs can transmit the virus to other animals or back to humans.
32408119, The mean and Std. deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21).All COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission.

32408041, There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 0.00002 mol m-2), a low reduction in CO (<0.03 mol m-2), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1-0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February-March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns.
32408041, Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m-3 across a large part of the globe during April-July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread.

32407893, The clinical features that were significantly related to infection were chill, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea.
32407893, Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated that infected returnees had resided within Iranian provinces that had experienced high levels of COVID-19.
32407893, The spatial distribution of the original homes of these returnees before departure for Iran demonstrated that returnees will largely return to northwest China, to regions that have only experienced low levels of infection within China.Blocking the reverse transmission of COVID-19 is critical in preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32407826, The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and ICU, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P=0.238).
32407826, The top five sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%).Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission.

32407306, The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32407306, Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death.
32407306, Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5).
32407306, Reporting of excess deaths might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.
32407303, The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1).
32407303, Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5).
32407303, These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances.
32407303, It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
32407301, During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported.
32407301, During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases.
32407301, Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing.
32407301, CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.
32407299, Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of COVID-19 into California.
32407299, Effectiveness of COVID-19 screening and monitoring in travelers to California was limited by incomplete traveler information received by federal officials and transmitted to states, the number of travelers needing follow-up, and the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.
32407299, More efficient methods of collecting and transmitting passenger data, including electronic provision of flight manifests by airlines to federal officials and flexible text-messaging tools, would help local health jurisdictions reach out to all at-risk travelers quickly, thereby facilitating timely testing, case identification, and contact investigations.
32407299, State and local health departments should weigh the resources needed to implement incoming traveler monitoring against community mitigation activities, understanding that the priorities of each might shift during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32406852, A total of 31 (54%) graduates had attended training on COVID-19, 29 (51%) are member of a rapid response team against COVID-19 and 54 (95%) had previous experience in response to disease outbreaks or health emergencies.
32406852, The vast majority were aware of the main symptoms, mode of transmission, high risk groups, and aware of how to use personal protective equipment.
32406852, A total of 46 (81%) respondents considered themselves well prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak and 40 (70%) reported that they currently have a role in supporting the country efforts in the management of COVID-19 outbreak.The FETP graduates in Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen were fully aware of the epidemiology COVID-19 and the safety measures and they are well positioned to investigate and respond to COVID-19 pandemic.
32406852, Therefore, they should be properly and efficiently utilized by the ministries of health to investigate and respond to the current COVID-19 crisis where the needs are vastly growing and access to outside experts becomes limited.
32406606, The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T>C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased.

32406395, Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control.
32406395, To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined.
32406395, Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32406305, This review aims to provide the basic information necessary for us, orthopaedic surgeons to prepare ourselves to face this pandemic together.
32406305, Herein, we cover the background of COVID-19, presentation, investigations, transmission, infection control and touch upon emerging treatments.
32406305, It is of paramount importance that we should stay vigilant for our patients, our families and ourselves.
32406305, Adequate infection control measures are necessary during day-to-day clinical work.
32406140, The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection.
32406140, Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect.
32406140, Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID-19.

32405905, Although participants' overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission.
32405905, Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32405905, A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants' age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income.
32405905, This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.

32405164, The number of fatalities was fast rising.
32405164, Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov.
32405164, It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.

32405152, Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak.
32405152, Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required.Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings.
32405152, Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging.

32405115, In that sense, specific strategies for prevention and treatment must be discussed. health care professionals dealing with SUD must be aware of the risks and challenges they will meet during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
32405115, Addiction care must be reinforced, instead of postponed, in order to avoid complications of both SUD and COVID-19 and to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32405028, Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection3,4.
32405028, Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19.
32405028, Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells.
32405028, The robust SARS-CoV-2 replication in human intestinal organoids suggests that the human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.
32404668, There are options in the form of eyewear, gloves, masks, respirators, and gowns.
32404668, The logical and practical utilization of these should be data driven and evolve based on both experience and data.
32404668, Last, situations specific to surgical populations are addressed.
32404668, We aim to provide granular collective data that has thus far been published and that can be used as a reference for optimal PPE choices in the perioperative setting for surgical teams.
32404623, In particular, a clear protocol describing optimal screening, timing of intervention and choice of personal protective equipment, is needed.
32404623, The authors have proposed an algorithm for management of CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that urgent and emergent CMF injuries are addressed appropriately while optimizing the safety of surgeons and other healthcare providers.
32404623, The algorithm is based on available evidence at the time of writing.
32404623, As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and more evidence and better testing becomes available, the algorithm should be modified accordingly.
32404436, We also demonstrate that viruses released into the intestinal lumen were inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid, and infectious virus was not recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients.

32404416, Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second.
32404416, In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of 8 to 14 min, which corresponds to droplet nuclei of ca. 4 μm diameter, or 12- to 21-μm droplets prior to dehydration.
32404416, These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

32404302, Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
32404302, Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
32404302, In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
32404302, Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
32403261, The success of the hand sanitization solely depends on the use of effective hand disinfecting agents formulated in various types and forms such as antimicrobial soaps, water-based or alcohol-based hand sanitizer, with the latter being widely used in hospital settings.
32403261, To date, most of the effective hand sanitizer products are alcohol-based formulations containing 62%-95% of alcohol as it can denature the proteins of microbes and the ability to inactivate viruses.
32403261, This systematic review correlated with the data available in Pubmed, and it will investigate the range of available hand sanitizers and their effectiveness as well as the formulation aspects, adverse effects, and recommendations to enhance the formulation efficiency and safety.
32403261, Further, this article highlights the efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizer against the coronavirus.
32403141, Among these neonates, three were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 16, 36, and 72 hours after birth, respectively, by nasopharyngeal swab real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; another six had elevated virus-specific antibody levels in serum samples collected after birth, but negative RT-PCR test results.
32403141, However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission. There is currently no direct evidence to support intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32403141, Additional RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are needed to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission.
32403141, For pregnant women infected during their first and second trimesters, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are needed.· We review neonates of mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).. · No direct virologic evidence of vertical transmission has been reported.. · No evidence that cesarean delivery is safer than vaginal delivery.. · More RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are recommended..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.
32402910, The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities.
32402910, The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012).
32402910, The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 °C ≤ T < 20 °C than in other temperature ranges, while the RR of COVID-19 transmission associated with AQI was higher in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10% ≤ RH < 20%. Results may suggest an enhanced impact of AQI on the COVID-19 spread under low RH.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32401931, Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
32401931, Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
32401931, All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
32401931, The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
32401373, Since January 2020, and by the end of April this year, more than 150 medical doctors in Italy and over 100 National Health Service workers in the UK have died in the COVID-19 crisis.
32401373, While the transmission of COVID 19 via human ex-haled droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is a significant risk particularly for dental practices.
32401373, The objective of this brief review is to highlight ways how dental manpower could protect from the spread of disease.This article is protected by copyright.

32401228, Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm.
32401226, The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported.
32401226, Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate.
32401226, Also, the rate of cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 women is unacceptably high.
32401226, Here we provide arguments for NOT changing the existing guidelines and caution against cesarean delivery that was the prevalent delivery mode in the reported cases and case series.
32401210, The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital.
32401210, Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown.
32401210, These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.©Chunmei Huang, Xinjie Xu, Yuyang Cai, Qinmin Ge, Guangwang Zeng, Xiaopan Li, Weide Zhang, Chen Ji, Ling Yang.

32401085, Key decisions from the pandemic response teams that help to minimise major disruptions in medical education and to control disease transmissions include: minimising inter-cluster cross contaminations and plans for segregation within and among cohorts; reshuffling academic calendars; postponing or restructuring assessments.Conclusions: While minimising the transmission of the pandemic outbreak within the healthcare establishments is paramount, medical education and research activities cannot come to a standstill each time there is a threat of one.
32400087, Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart.
32400087, Other considerations including ethical, financial, societal, and logistical concerns are also addressed.
32400087, We conclude that, for selected patients with high waitlist mortality, transplant programs should consider accepting heart or liver transplants from deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32400044,While elective cardiac surgeries have been postponed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and to reduce resource utilization, patients with urgent indications necessitating surgery may still be at risk of contracting the disease throughout their postoperative recovery.
32400044, We present a case of an 81-year-old female who underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting and was readmitted following discharge to a nursing facility with a cluster of COVID-19 cases.
32400044, Despite symptomatology and imaging concerning for COVID-19, two initial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were negative but a third test was positive.
32400044, This case emphasizes the risks of discharge location in the COVID-19 era as well as the importance of clinical suspicion, early isolation practices for those presumed positive, and repeat testing, given the marginal sensitivity of available COVID-19 RT-PCR.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32400013, Herein, we present the case of a patient who underwent ABO-incompatible living donor liver transplantation without knowing that the liver donor was infected with COVID-19 during the donation procedure.
32400013, In this case, the donor-derived transmission to the recipient was not identified, and the liver donor was found to be recovering from a COVID-19 infection.

32399507, We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place.
32399507, Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5).
32399507, Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government.
32399507, While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region..
32399501, Undertaking the following activities at least once in the previous week was associated with illness onset: using a bus, (aOR 1.48, p=0.049), shopping at small shops (1.9, p<0.002) attending a place of worship (1.81, p=0.005).    Conclusions: Exposure to potentially crowded places, public transport and to individuals with a cold increases risk of acquiring circulating acute respiratory infections.
32399501, This suggests social distancing measures can have an important impact on slowing transmission of emerging respiratory infections.Copyright: © 2020 Hayward AC et al.
32398569, Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.
32398569, Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.
32398569, Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.
32398569, Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.

32398162,The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is inarguably the most challenging coronavirus outbreak relative to the previous outbreaks involving SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32398162, With the number of COVID-19 cases now exceeding 2 million worldwide, it is apparent that (i) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very high and (ii) there are large variations in disease severity, one component of which may be genetic variability in the response to the virus.
32398162, Controlling current rates of infection and combating future waves require a better understanding of the routes of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the underlying genomic susceptibility to this disease.
32398162, In this mini-review, we highlight possible genetic determinants of COVID-19 and the contribution of aerosol exposure as a potentially important transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.
32398137, This is clearly evident form the fact that while the number of infected cases were on the peak in China India was one of the least affected countries.
32398137, The number of cases in India started exhibiting a sharp increase in the infected cases only after the European countries and USA recorded large number of infected cases.
32398137, We further argue that while the number of cases in middle eastern countries may still be very low, the airports in middle eastern countries, particularly Dubai, being one of the largest transit hubs for international passengers, including arriving in India, might have posed a higher risk of getting infected with 2019-nCoV.
32398137, We suggest that any future travel related disease infection screening at the airports should critically assess the passengers from major transit hubs in addition to affected country of origin.
32397699, Conclusion: There is no age and gender specific differences in the Tg of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo, and COVID-19 has high infectivity and spreading power in early phase.
32397698, Conclusion: It was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 caused by a super spreader in a massive rally.
32397698, The epidemic has been under effective control.
32397697, Conclusions: COVID-19 is highly infectious in the incubation period.
32397697, The more confined the space is, the higher the risk is,and the longer the single exposure is, the higher the risk of transmission is.
32397697, Indirect contact transmission still exists.
32397688, The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32397688, To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
32397688, Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
32397688, Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.
32397515, In conclusion, proactive border control measures are effective for preventing community transmission of this disease.
32397487,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global ongoing pandemic.
32397487, Timely, accurate and non-invasive SARS-CoV-2 detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, as well as determination of their immune status, will facilitate effective large-scale pandemic control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32397487, Saliva is a biofluid whose anatomical source and location is of particularly strategic relevance to COVID-19 transmission and monitoring.
32397487, This review focuses on the role of saliva as both a foe (a common mode of viral transmission via salivary droplets and potentially aerosols) and a friend (as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for viral detection and immune status surveillance) in combating COVID-19.
32397138, Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine.
32397138, Inter-species transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses.
32397138, Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses.
32397138, These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics.
32397011, Glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 60 (12.90%) and 218(46.88%) patients, respectively.
32397011, Bioinformatics showed four single amino acid mutations and one amino acid position loss in SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province, with more similarity to humans than to viruses.SARS-CoV-2 showed virological mutations and more human transmission in Zhejiang province, indicating considerable epidemiological and clinical changes.

32396877, Stringent infection control measures have been taken to minimise the transmission between individuals and healthcare workers, especially those undertaking aerosols generating medical procedures.
32396877, The uncertainties surrounding infection transmission through breath tests in particular, and to some extent faecal testing, will invariably cause concerns among both the patients and the healthcare workers.
32396877, It is therefore pertinent that all of the necessary measures are adopted to minimise this risk of spreading.
32396877, In this article, we summarise the physiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the implications for breath testing (in both the clinical and research arena) as well as outlining methods to mitigate these risks.© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.
32396710,Coronaviridae (CoVs) are single stranded RNA viruses. βeta-CoVs encompasses Bat coronavirus (BCoV), the human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus.

32396601, The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel.
32396601, Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications.During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities.
32396601, Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage.

32396516, Over half the participants (n=5878, 57.7%) were confident that the epidemic could be curbed in China; 92.4% (n=9427) opened windows for ventilation more frequently than usual; 97.9% (n=9986) used masks in public; 95.7% (n=9759) avoided large crowds and stayed at home as much as possible; and 97.9% (n=9988) washed their hands more often than usual.
32396516, Women were more likely to practice these behaviors than men (P<.001).
32396516, With a series of strict public control measures, like nationwide health education campaigns, holiday extensions, the Examine and Approve Policy on the resumption of work, close management of working and living quarters, a health QR (Quick Response) code system, community screening, and social distancing policies, the number of new cases have decreased dramatically since February 12, 2020.The methods employed by Chinese citizens and authorities have effectively curtailed the spread of COVID-19, demonstrating that this pandemic can be brought under control as long as the right measures are taken.©Yu Huang, Qingqing Wu, Ping Wang, Yan Xu, Lei Wang, Yusui Zhao, Dingming Yao, Yue Xu, Qiaohong Lv, Shuiyang Xu.

32396455, Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed.
32396455, Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed.
32396455, The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.
32396455, This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.
32396126, First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend.
32396126, Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction.
32396126, The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic.
32396126, Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.
32395673, Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32395673, Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
32395673, This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.
32395673, We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.© 2020 The Author(s).
32395550, At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment.
32395550, After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.

32395541, These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination.
32395541, Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.

32394687, Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic.
32394687, Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provide close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease.
32394687, Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32394687, Herein we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion.
32394052, Most countries including India have announced some sort of lockdown to reduce the effects of COVID-19 and discontinue the transmission of novel coronavirus.
32394052, Major negative effects on the social and surrounding environment have been reported due to COVID-19, however positive effects have also been observed with respect to air quality.
32394052, Secondary results have been taken from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), indicating significant reduction (50%) in air quality of Indian region.
32394052, This perspective highlights the effects of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on aerosol optical thickness specifically in India.
32393381, The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
32393381, After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
32393381, Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
32393381, Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
32393346, Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.
32393346, Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.
32393346, Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.
32393346, Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.
32393111, The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited to retort this virus.
32393111, Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies.
32393111, Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32393111, This review discusses in brief about the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the role of animals, the veterinary and associated zoonotic links along with prevention and control strategies based on One-health approaches.
32392880, One week after the introduction of strict measures, the increase in daily new cases was reversed, and the reproduction number dropped.
32392880, The crude estimates tended to overestimate the reproduction rate in the early phase.
32392880, Publicly available data provide a first estimate about the effectiveness of public health measures.
32392880, However, more data are needed for an unbiased assessment.
32392377, Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources.
32392377, The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England.Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world.
32392377, This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.This article is protected by copyright.

32392337, Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted.
32392337, Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission.Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32392337, This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2020.

32391746, No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted.
32391746, Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic.An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs.
32391746, With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs.
32391746, Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.
32391670, Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
32391670, Secondly, an initial ow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
32391670, Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
32391670, Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
32391661, Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted.
32391661, By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed.The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province.
32391661, Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people.
32391661, In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people.The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.
32391660,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grade B infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32391660, In pace with the spreading of the disease, biosafety risk of the biological specimen preservation in biobanks has been significantly increased and biosafety protection during biological specimen preservation become increasingly important.
32391660, According to the related national rules and the corresponding guidelines of Chinese Medical Association, this paper introduced the etiology about SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology about COVID-19, and the biosafety protection principles of individuals and biological specimen storage places in the process of personal protection, protection of collection, transport, handling, preservation, detection, post-detection disposal and emergencies of biological specimen.
32391660, Emphasized to carry out a strict biosafety-risk assessment on biological specimen basing on virus load information, infectivity, and sample type (possible contact transmission, aerosol transmission, and fecal oral transmission).
32391651, Aerosol generating procedures in dental health care can increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
32391651, Due to the risk of infection of both dental healthcare workers and patients, additional infection control measures for all patients are strongly recommended when providing dental health care.

32391518, For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.5,6Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission.
32391518, Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive.
32391518, In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32391409, In societies with constrained data infrastructures, modeling and forecasting COVID-19 becomes an extremely difficult endeavor.
32391409, Nonetheless, we propose an online forecasting mechanism that streams data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to update the parameters of an ensemble model which in turn provides updated COVID-19 forecasts every 24 hours.
32391409, The ensemble combines an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Prophet - an additive regression model developed by Facebook, and a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model combined with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH).
32391409, The outcomes of these efforts are expected to provide academic thrust in guiding the policymakers in the deployment of containment strategies and/or assessment of containment interventions in stemming the spread of the disease in Nigeria.© 2020 The Authors.
32391309, Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low.
32391309, This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract.
32391309, However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection.
32391309, Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.Copyright © 2020 Sun, Wang, Liu and Liu.

32391240, Combing characteristics of the historical epidemic, we found part of the released data is unreasonable.
32391240, Through ruling out the unreasonable data, the model predictions exhibit that the number of the cumulative 2019-nCoV cases may reach 76,000 to 230,000, with a peak of the unrecovered infectives (22,000-74,000) occurring in late February to early March.
32391240, After that, the infected cases will rapidly monotonically decrease until early May to late June, when the 2019-nCoV outbreak will fade out.
32391240, Strong anti-epidemic measures may reduce the cumulative infected cases by 40%-49%. The improvement of medical care can also lead to about one-half transmission decrease and effectively shorten the duration of the 2019-nCoV.
32391022, As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
32391022, Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32391022, The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments.

32389891, Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution.
32389891, HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods.

32388934, Conclusion: Regions with different economic level, population scale, and different prevention and control capabilities should all initiate scientific assessment of medical resource requirement under emergency response and prepare for possible future rebound and epidemic.
32388933, The secondary attack rate in close contacts with shortest incubation period of 1-3 days was 17.12%-18.99%, the secondary attack rate in family members was 46.11%-49.56%. Conclusions: The cluster epidemic of COVID-19 in Guangzhou mainly occurred in families, the contagiousness was high.
32388933, It is necessary to strengthen the prevention and control to reduce the community transmission of COVID-19.
32388698, A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset.
32388698, The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists.
32388698, These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology.
32388698, Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.
32388643,The COVID-19 pandemic has swept the globe with more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 184 countries and territories.
32388643, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two crucial actions can reduce the risk of person-to-person viral transmission: frequent hand washing and surface decontamination with specific environmental protection agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants.
32388643, As hygiene recommendations evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic and community members adopt changing practices, dermatologists are likely to see a rise in adverse cutaneous reactions from prolonged irritant exposures and widespread use of antimicrobials.
32388643, The purposes of this report are to familiarize dermatologists with the hygiene practices recommended for COVID-19 prevention, to highlight adverse cutaneous reactions associated with repeated exposures to detergents and disinfectants, and to discuss strategies which patients can implement during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize skin irritation white still performing hygiene practices effectively.
32388469, The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is often delayed compared to that of respiratory symptoms.
32388469, It has been noted that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in fecal matter for an extended period of time, even after respiratory samples have tested negative and patients are asymptomatic.
32388469, In this article, SARS-CoV-2 and its disease COVID-19 will be reviewed with consideration of the latest literature about gastrointestinal symptomatology, the mechanisms by which the virus may inflict damage, and the possibility of viral replication contributing to a fecal-oral route of transmission.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32388162, Here, regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing ambient ozone concentration level from 48.83 to 94.67 μg/m3 (p-value = 0.039) and decreasing relative humidity from 23.33 to 82.67% (p-value = 0.002) and temperature from -13.17 to 19 °C) (p-value = 0.003) observed for Chinese cities during Jan-March 2020.
32388162, Besides using these environmental implications, social distancing and wearing a mask are strongly encouraged to maximize the fight against the COVID-19 airborne transmission.

32388138, Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive.
32388138, Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen.
32388138, Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission.
32388138, Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32388137, Our results showed that higher mean temperatures and average relative humidity favored the COVID-19 transmission, differently from reports from coldest countries or periods of time under cool temperatures.
32388137, Thus, considering the results obtained, intersectoral policies and actions are necessary, mainly in cities where the contamination rate is increasing rapidly.
32388137, Thus, prevention and protection measures should be adopted in these cities aiming to reduce transmission and the possible collapse of the health system.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32387564, Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2.
32387564, Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host.

32386898, The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana.
32386898, The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan.Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32386545, By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions.
32386545, Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions.

32386473, The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission.
32386473, This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively.
32386473, One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations.
32386473, Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.© 2020 Joule Inc. or its licensors.
32386437, Because of exponential growth, social distancing is a critical strategy to decrease transmission Thus, educational medical communities from many countries have transitioned to online didactics1 . Recommendations to cancel all non-urgent visits have been proposed2 . Our dermatology department has canceled all elective outpatient visits and surgeries.
32386437, Consequently, trainees' surgical skills have been severely affected.

32386435,We have read with great interest the articles regarding cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.
32386435, Studies showed 20.4% of COVID-19 patients developed cutaneous manifestations and might be the only presenting symptom.(1) To date, previous cases reported urticaria as one of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19.(2)(1)(3)(4) This atypical symptom might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and virus transmission, especially in countries where cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported widely such as in Indonesia.
32386435, We would like to report a case of urticaria in COVID-19-positive non-ICU hospitalized patient from Indonesia to bring awareness to its cutaneous manifestations.This article is protected by copyright.

32386433, However, despite our best efforts to mitigate viral transmission, many of our migraine patients may eventually be exposed to SARS-CoV2.
32386433, While most patients will have mild to moderate symptoms, a subset will become severely ill, with possible complications including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32386433, Given the possibility of this level of severe respiratory illness, we should consider what effect blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) might have on these patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32385569, We aim to assess the presence of COVID-19 in peritoneal fluid.We performed a laparoscopic appendicectomy for a COVID-19-infected patient with acute appendicitis.
32385569, Peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings were collected and sent for COVID-19 PCR.The peritoneal fluid sample collected on entry and at the end of the operation was negative for COVID-19 on PCR.
32385569, The patient had an uneventful recovery from surgery.This case revealed that COVID-19 was not detected in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings in a patient infected with COVID-19.
32385569, This study provides novel preliminary data in the investigation of COVID-19 transmission from laparoscopy-related aerosolization.
32385225, The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women.
32385225, They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences.
32385225, Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences.
32385225, This will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.
32385219, The receptor binding domain of the spike protein interacts with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and is considered as the antigenic determinant for stimulating an immune response.

32385067, Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020).In univariate analyses, there were few or no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99).
32385067, Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85).
32385067, In a multivariable model, there was a strong association with the number of implemented public health interventions (p for trend = 0.001), whereas the association with absolute humidity was no longer significant.Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with latitude and temperature, but may be associated weakly with relative or absolute humidity.
32385067, Conversely, public health interventions were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth.Joule Inc. or its licensors.
32384377, Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60 cm in radius.Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site.
32384377, Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate.
32384377, Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30 cm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, p = 0.0066).Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment.
32384377, A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.
32384228, Across the board, the milieu of wards has altered, with seeking to preserve bed spaces admission criteria has become stricter and patients are being fast tracked out of inpatient care with less time to transition back into the community.
32384228, In order to restrict opportunities for transmission of Covid 19 between patients and the public, wards which previously were unlocked during the day are now locked at all times without use of mental health legislation.

32382154, We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale.
32382154, The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission.
32382154, Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.
32382154, The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15.
32382001, Neonates appeared to be affected to a greater extent.
32382001, A death was reported in a premature newborn whose mother had COVID-19 pneumonia.
32382001, There did not appear to be vertical transmission from mother to child.
32382001, Nevertheless, this information was not conclusive.COVID-19 appears to be more benign with pregnant women than with their neonates.
32381375, Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare.

32381147, In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE.
32381147, In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure.
32381147, No patient-HCW transmission was detected despite intensive surveillance.Our institution successfully utilized the strategy of an RSW over a 6-week period to contain a cluster of COVID-19 cases and to prevent patient-HCW transmission.
32381147, However, this method was resource-intensive in terms of testing and bed capacity.
32381073, The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms.The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild.
32381073, Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease.
32381073, The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms.
32381073, This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.
32380453, There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
32380453, Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life.

32379909,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic that is causing thousands of deaths worldwide.
32379909, The virus can be transmitted from person to person, directly or indirectly, via the respiratory, oro-fecal and probably sexual routes.1 The eventual vertical transmission route is still poorly explored.
32379909, However, mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the placenta probably does not occur, or likely occurs very rarely.2 All the studies conducted on COVID-19 pregnant women involved patients undergoing cesarean section, but the indications for such delivery modality were not clearly stated.This article is protected by copyright.

32379733, Ongoing traveler importation of SARS-CoV-2, attendance at professional and social events, introduction into facilities or settings prone to amplification, and challenges in virus detection all contributed to rapid acceleration of transmission during March.
32379733, Public health responses included intensive efforts to detect cases and trace contacts, and implementation of multiple community mitigation strategies.
32379733, Because most of the population remains susceptible to infection, recognition of factors associated with amplified spread during the early acceleration period will help inform future decisions as locations in the United States scale back some components of mitigation and strengthen systems to detect a potential transmission resurgence.
32379733, U.S. circulation of SARS-CoV-2 continues, and sustained efforts will be needed to prevent future spread within the United States.
32379731, Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
32379731, Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered.
32379731, Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3).
32379731, Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).
32379707, Incubation period distributions were modeled for each group by the method of the posterior Weibull distribution estimation.Adults aged 30 to 59 years had the most substantial proportion of confirmed cases in China.
32379707, The incubation period distribution varied slightly across patient groups with different travel histories.
32379707, Patients who regularly lived in Wuhan and left to other locations before January 23, 2020 had the shortest posterior median value of 7.57 days for the incubation period, while the incubation periods for persons affected by local community transmission had the largest posterior median of incubation periods, 9.31 days.The median incubation period for all patients infected outside Wuhan was 9 days, a bit of more extended than the early estimated 5-day incubation period that was based on patients in Wuhan.

32379199, The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection.The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.
32379199, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children.
32379199, The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.
32379199, The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.
32379015, Everything is overwhelmed in the face of a rapid escalation of cases.
32379015, The countries that have already reported the peak of transmission are easing their preventive measures yet fearing a second wave of infection.
32379015, If the virus causes that next wave, are we sufficiently prepared to deal with it? I argue that the stakeholders concerned should simultaneously handle the ongoing pandemic while making effective preparations for its second wave.
32379015, To relax the preventive measures, countries must thoroughly revisit their situations based on scientific evidence.
32378762,Before 2020 the term 'social distancing' while not new, was barely known.
32378762, The concept was promoted by the World Health Organisation in 2008 as a public health measure to prevent transmission of influenza, and in various forms it can be identified in reference to epidemics going back hundreds of years.
32378762, However, in common parlance social distancing is more likely to have been associated with stigma or social class, something with negative connotations, something to be avoided.This article is protected by copyright.

32378729, An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined.
32378729, More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
32378729, Herewith, presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.
32378729, Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.
32378460, Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people.
32378460, It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear.
32378460, The biopsychopharmacosocial model provides one method of assessing mental health and planning health and social care needs.
32378460, This article hopes to guide community health professionals through the specifics of this assessment model in relation to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.
32377932, Despite this, evolutionarily successful transmissions are rare.
32377932, Such events can cause pandemics and are followed by host-virus coevolution procedures that can increase the fitness potential of viruses.
32377932, In this perspective article, I recognize eight main types of trans-species viral transmission.
32377932, I consider two of them as evolutionarily successful, explaining why coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 could be one of them.
32377559, As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered.
32377559, Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate.
32377559, An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.

32377486, It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW).
32377486, Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW.
32377486, Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout.
32377486, The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.Copyright © 2020, Shah et al.

32377018,Human behaviour is central to transmission of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and changing behaviour is crucial to preventing transmission in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions.
32377018, Isolation and social distancing measures, including edicts to stay at home, have been brought into place across the globe to reduce transmission of the virus, but at a huge cost to individuals and society.
32377018, In addition to these measures, we urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not touching one's eyes, nose or mouth.
32377018, There is an urgent need for direct evidence to inform development of such interventions, but it is possible to make a start by applying behavioural science methods and models.

32375884, Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category.Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs.
32375884, Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs.
32375884, Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission.During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue.
32375884, Tracheal procedures like tracheostomy and endotracheal suctioning can also result in airborne transmission via small virus containing aerosols.
32375455, In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread.We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes.
32375455, We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method.The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide.
32375455, Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June.We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in Korea.
32375455, Since the outbreak is expected to continue until May, non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term are required.
32375197, There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews.
32375197, These articles could be classified into the topics "Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission", "Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19", "Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic", and "Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure". Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth.Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19.
32375197, As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic.

32374647, In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure.
32374647, We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols.
32374647, A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist.
32374647, At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.
32374400, Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day.
32374400, During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness.
32374400, The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10 000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence.Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 illness continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month.
32374400, Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local health care systems in US cities.
32374001, Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms "2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test" were used.
32374001, As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
32374001, We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
32374001, All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
32373467, In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained.
32373467, Ocular involvement and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should never be overlooked.
32373467, In fact, conjunctival mucosae are susceptible to respiratory viruses and remain an important point of entry.
32373467, For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.© 2020 The Author(s).
32373409, Frequent hand washing implies a prolonged exposure to water and other chemical or physical agents and may induce several pathophysiologic changes, such as epidermal barrier disruption, impairment of keratinocytes, the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of the skin immune system, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.
32373409, Adverse dermatologic effects, such as excessive skin dryness or even contact dermatitis (particularly the irritant subtype and, to a lesser extent, the allergic subtype), can occur, especially in individuals with a history of atopic dermatitis.
32373409, These skin conditions are perfectly manageable, and applying a moisturizer immediately after washing hands or after using a portable hand sanitizer is the cornerstone in preventing the development of eczematous changes in the hands.
32373409, In the current global context, the potential occurrence of these dermatological adverse events should in no way cause people to deviate from strict hand hygiene rules.Copyright © 2020, Beiu et al.
32373189, The effects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed.
32373189, Emerging data indicate that smoking history is the major determinant of worsening COVID-19 outcomes.
32373189, Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function.
32373189, Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as a public health measure to limit the global impact of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Radcliffe Cardiology.
32373061, Acute stroke care requires rapid bedside attendance, imaging, and intervention.
32373061, However, for acute stroke patients who have a diagnosis of or are under investigation for COVID-19, the concern for nosocomial transmission moderates operational procedures for acute stroke care.

32372755, Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak.
32372755, Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.
32371560,Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19 thereby increasing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 like other procedures such as tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
32371560, Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients and patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

32370924, Best practices for PPE use in patients who have unknown COVID-19 status are a highly charged and emotional issue.
32370924, The variables to be considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources.

32370275, Doctors having institutional protocols for dealing with COVID-19 cases and those with sustained availability of PPE reported higher scores of preparedness (5.5 ± 2.3 and 6.2 ± 2.1 with p < 0.001, respectively).
32370275, Correlations with knowledge score, adherence to PPE score, and psychological impacts were investigated.
32370275, The study revealed multiple challenges and insufficiencies that can affect frontline doctors' preparedness.
32370275, Policy makers are urged to take these findings into consideration and to act promptly.
32370128, However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions.
32370128, DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males.
32370128, Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.
32370128, The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados.
32369975, However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures.
32369975, A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high.
32369975, Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully.
32369975, This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.
32369475, The presence of personnel in endoscopy should be limited to the bare minimum.
32369475, Said personnel must have daily temperature control and if it is above 37.3ºC, the corresponding evaluation must be carried out.
32369475, After each procedure, the stretcher and room surfaces should be properly disinfected.
32369475, High-level disinfection of endoscopes eliminates SARS-CoV-2.
32369429, Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
32369429, Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
32369429, Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
32369429, To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.

32368884, Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease.
32368884, Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale.
32368884, Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm.
32368884, The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.
32368850, The factors we consider include: 1) the risk of blood transmission SARS-CoV-2, 2) involvement of donor organs, 3) lack of effective therapies, 4) exposure of healthcare and recovery teams, 5) disease transmission and propagation, and 6) hospital resource utilization.
32368850, While we acknowledge that transplantation fulfills the mission of saving lives, it is imperative to consider the consequences not only to our recipients, but also to the community and to healthcare workers, particularly in the absence of effective preventative or curative therapies.
32368850, For these reasons, we believe the evidence and risks show that COVID-19 infection should continue to remain a contraindication for donation, as has been the initial response of donation and transplantation societies.This article is protected by copyright.

32368799, The infectious nature of COVID-19 poses an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers that should be taken into consideration.We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and look back at previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID-19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy.
32368799, If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel.
32368799, Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure.Thorough preprocedural planning, use of experienced personnel, enhanced personal protective equipment where available, and a thoughtful anesthesia approach are instrumental in maximizing positive patient outcomes while successfully protecting the safety of healthcare personnel.

32367847, The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections.
32367847, In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
32367847, We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19.
32367847, The present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19.
32367793, Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007).Among the cases, most patients were young adults.
32367793, Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females.
32367793, Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure.
32367793, Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.
32367576, In addition, saliva-contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross-infection.
32367576, Hence, the control of saliva-related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID-19.
32367576, Based on our experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva-related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners.This article is protected by copyright.

32366488, The average periods of incubation, clinical onset serial interval (COSI), and virus shedding were 4.5 days, 5.2±3.2 days, and 18.5 days, respectively.
32366488, Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure with small, irrelevant mutations was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability.SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted person-to-person regardless of whether they have symptoms in both hospital settings and social activities based on the short period of incubation and COSI.
32366488, The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close-contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas.
32366488, Besides, the HCWs should be alert during the epidemic, and make self-quarantine if self-suspected.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32366195,In this commentary, we briefly summarize the available data from Iran and other countries on the sudden increase in anosmia, hyposmia, and hypogeusia that has coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32366195, Alarmingly, a high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 had isolated anosmia as the sole initial presenting symptom, which is likely due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and obstruction.
32366195, Since isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for COVID-19, we wish to raise awareness on the association of anosmia with COVID-19, urging international and national health authorities to consider this association in their efforts for early detection and isolation of infected individuals and for breaking the chain of transmission.
32366195, We urge our colleagues who assess patients with new-onset anosmia to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines to reduce the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic.
32366173, In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management.
32366173, The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection.
32366173, In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department.
32366173, The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.
32366034, This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).
32366034, Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment.
32366034, Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared.
32366034, This overview will address several issues concerned with the COVID-19 pandemic that directly relate to dental practice in terms of prevention, treatment, and orofacial clinical manifestations.

32365045, Finally, for the scenario of "panic shopping" or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy.Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
32365045, However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India.

32363205, The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed.Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission.
32363205, It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later.
32363205, After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus.

32362647, Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts.
32362645, Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer.
32362645, Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden.
32362645, Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus.
32362645, As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.
32362642, This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India.
32362642, Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts.
32362642, The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats.
32362642, The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.

32362062, Keeping the integrity of skin barrier is a critical method to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV, since skin is the first line of defense of human body(4).
32362062, It is of prime importance to ensure and maintain the skin clean, sterilized and protected of clinical health care staff during the fight against the epidemic.
32362062, Self-protection of the medical staff is essential, however, utilizing protective equipment such as goggles, masks and protective clothing continuously impairs skin integrity and the skin damage caused by the respective protective measures must be taken seriously.This article is protected by copyright.

32361996,Oral swabs, sputum, and blood samples from 18 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined using RT-PCR testing in order to assess the risk of transfusion-related transmission.
32361996, In asymptomatic patients as well as patients with flu-like symptoms and fever, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the blood or serum despite a clearly positive result in all throat swabs.
32361996, As patients with symptoms of infectious disease will not be admitted to blood donation, the risk for transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be negligible.© 2020 The Authors.

32361692, The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays an important role in viral attachment, fusion and entry.
32361692, However, other structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins are potential influencers in virus pathogenicity.
32361692, Among these proteins; Orf3, Orf8, and Orf10 show the least homology to SARSCoV proteins and therefore should be further studied for their abilities to modulate antiviral and inflammatory responses.
32361692, Here, we discuss how SARS-COV-2 interacts with our immune system.
32361598, In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters.
32361598, The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C-25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments.
32361598, The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32361528, The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship.
32361528, Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission.
32361528, Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32361161, On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.
32361161, According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems.
32361161, In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32361152, When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process.The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements.The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse.
32361152, To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections.
32361152, In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.Copyright © 2020.

32360580, Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
32360580, The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
32360580, Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32359226, Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists.
32359226, Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure.
32359226, As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.

32359194, As of April 28, 2020, the number of confirmed cases is 210 773, including 102 548 patients recovered, more than 10 300 admitted to the ICU, and 23 822 deaths, with a global case fatality rate of 11.3%. From the perspective of donation and transplantation, the Spanish system first focused on safety issues, providing recommendations for donor evaluation and testing, and to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in potential recipients prior to transplantation.
32359194, Since the country entered into an epidemiological scenario of sustained community transmission and saturation of intensive care, developing donation and transplantation procedures has become highly complex.
32359194, Since the national state of alarm was declared in Spain on March 13, 2020, the mean number of donors has declined from 7.2 to 1.2 per day, and the mean number of transplants from 16.1 to 2.1 per day.

32357503, Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
32357503, In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
32357503, Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.

32356867, The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%).
32356867, The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]).
32356867, The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings.
32356867, The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]).In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.
32356641, These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
32356641, Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
32356641, Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
32356641, This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.
32355904, Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17-45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34-58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics.
32355904, Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9-18%).
32355904, Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic.
32355904, The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.© 2020 The Authors.
32355863,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, while the routes of transmission of this virus are still controversial.
32355863, We enrolled 33 patients, without any ocular manifestation, with their ocular surface swabs collected for virus detection.
32355863, RNA was detected strong positive in samples of both eyes from two patients.
32355863, Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may exist in the normal ocular surface of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that this virus might be spread through conjunctival contact.© The Author(s) 2020.
32355837, With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
32355837, Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.

The current moment provides a formidable test of this question, as widespread transmission of Covid-19 and intense efforts to slow it drastically transform our environment.
32355392, Here, we consider how the experience of purpose may be impacted by disruptions in three key person-environment interactions: how we engage with work, how we engage in education, and how we manage physical proximity.
32355392, We hope to motivate critical thinking about how this pandemic, and our collective responses to it, influence the experience of purpose and delineate a research agenda that may inform how individuals' can preserve a sense of engagement and contribution.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32355131, Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality.
32355131, Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care.
32355131, Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes.
32355131, As physician-leaders enact new policies to respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, it is important to consider the potential for exacerbating existing health inequities and to be proactive in creating policies that promote equity.

32354293, There are reports of neonatal infection, but no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission has been found.Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of non-pregnant adults.
32354293, Fetal and neonatal outcomes appear good in most cases, but available data only include pregnant women infected in their third trimesters.
32354293, Further studies are needed to ascertain long-term outcomes and potential intrauterine vertical transmission.
32354081, The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak.
32354081, Considering the virus' route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection).
32354081, This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices.
32354081, This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice to reduce infection risk.
32353991, Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases.
32353991, The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65-8.41) at day 22 (19 March 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83-7.88) at day 25 (22 March 2020).
32353991, The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26-1.58).
32353991, These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.
32353982, Although great concern has been expressed about COVID-19 infection acquired through ocular transmission, its underlying mechanism has not currently been clarified.
32353982, In the current work, we analyzed and elucidated the two main elements that should be taken into account to understand the "ocular route", both from a clinical and molecular point of view.
32353982, They are represented by the dynamism of the ocular surface system (e.g., the tear film turnover) and the distribution of ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 protein.
32353982, Although it seems, at the moment, that there is a low risk of coronavirus spreading through tears, it may survive for a long time or replicate in the conjunctiva, even in absence of conjunctivitis signs, indicating that eye protection (e.g., protective goggles alone or in association with face shield) is advisable to prevent contamination from external droplets and aerosol.
32353825, All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection.
32353825, During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.

32353720, Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person.
32353720, This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions.

32352954, In addition to the 31 residents and six staff members identified through testing at the shelters, two additional cases in residents were identified during separate symptom screening events, and four were identified after two residents and two staff members independently sought health care.
32352954, In total, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 35 of 195 (18%) residents and eight of 38 (21%) staff members who received testing at the shelter or were evaluated elsewhere.
32352954, COVID-19 can spread quickly in homeless shelters; rapid interventions including testing and isolation to identify cases and minimize transmission are necessary.
32352954, CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident's heads are at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1).
32352915,The world is facing an unprecedented global pandemic in the form of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has ravaged all aspects of life, especially health systems.
32352915, Radiology services, in particular, are under threat of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients affected, unless drastic efforts are taken to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus.
32352915, Proactive measures, therefore, must be taken to ensure the continuation of diagnostic and interventional support to clinicians, while minimizing the risk of nosocomial transmission among staff and other patients.
32352915, This article aims to highlight several strategies to improve preparedness, readiness and response towards this pandemic, specific to the radiology department.
32352576, Centers should therefore be meticulous in their approach to a SARS-CoV-2+ pregnancy to optimize clinical outcomes for both mother and child.

32352314, The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection ('totally naïve'), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve.
32352314, Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect.
32352314, For R0 > 1, the number infected tends to increase, and for R0 < 1, transmission dies out.
32352314, Non-pharmaceutical strategies to handle the epidemic are sketched and based on current knowledge, the current situation is sketched and scenarios for the near future discussed.
32351873, With a death toll approaching that of China's SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert.
32351873, Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak.To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans.This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
32351873, The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms.This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission.

32351807, In fact, in one of the most recent studies looking at 73 patients, approximately 24% remained positive in their stool for evidence of the virus, though not necessarily infection, after showing negative in respiratory samples.
32351807, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that after two negative respiratory tests separated by ≥ 24 hours, patients can be dismissed from having transmissibility infection risk for COVID-19.
32351807, The potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 needs to be strongly considered.
32351807, Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.Copyright © 2020, Cipriano et al.
32351102, We are severely affected by the nations with vast numbers of deaths; it was hard to predict such a colossal pandemic with terrifying consequences.
32351102, Elective surgeries are limited, but situations requiring an urgent gynaecological or obstetric surgical approach must still be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32351102, Concerns regarding surgical safety and the risk of viral transmission during surgery are of great importance.
32351102, In this review, we aimed to summarize the concepts related to laparoscopic gynecological surgery during COVID-19 pandemic in the light of current literature.
32351056, The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups.
32351056, By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3.
32351056, The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019.
32351056, Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.
32350060, We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19.

32349772,Recently, an outbreak of viral pneumonitis in Wuhan, Hubei, China successively spread as a global pandemia, led to the identification of a novel betacoronavirus species, the 2019 novel coronavirus, successively designated 2019-nCoV then SARS-CoV-2).
32349772, The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32349772, Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies.
32349772, This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.
32349120, Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across all of China.
32349120, Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage.
32349120, Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations.
32349120, This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.
32349113, We also endeavor to answer the key frequently asked questions in areas of the coronaviruses, COVID-19, disease transmission, personal protection, mask selection, and special measures in ophthalmic practices.
32349113, COVID-19 is highly infectious and could be life-threatening.
32349113, Using our protocol and measures, we have achieved zero infection in our ophthalmic practices in Hong Kong and China.
32349113, Preventing spread of COVID-19 is possible and achievable.
32349035, Two possible "L" and "S" SNP found in ORF1ab and ORF8 regions are detected CONCLUSION:: We perform genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequence of SARS-CoV-2.
32349035, Studies about the biological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in clinic animal and humans will manipulate an understanding the origin of pandemic crisis.
32349014, Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles.
32349014, Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to "flatten the curve" supersedes usual teaching responsibilities.
32349014, Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines.
32349014, The pool of graduating medical students affected by this pause in direct patient contact represents a powerful reserve, which may soon need to be utilized as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the U.S. health care infrastructure.
32348600, Many otolaryngology procedures, including laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy, place otolaryngologists at increased risk of coronavirus transmission due to close contact with respiratory droplets and aerosolization from the procedure.
32348600, The aim of this study is to provide an overview of guidelines on how to perform these procedures during the coronavirus pandemic.Literature review was performed.
32348600, Articles citing laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy use with regard to COVID-19 were included.Laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy are all used in both emergent and elective situations.
32348600, Understanding the risk stratification of cases and the varied necessity of personal protective equipment is important in protecting patients and health care workers.Summary guidelines based on the literature available at this time are presented in order to decrease transmission of the virus and protect those involved.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32348581, Surgical volume and clinic visits are curtailed, personal protective equipment for operating room participation is restricted, and the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission during heretofore routine patient care is the new norm.We describe a small-team "cohorting" protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures.A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between department members but providing comprehensive coverage.
32348581, Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions.
32348581, Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures.
32348581, Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy.A small-team-based approach with guidelines for faculty/resident roles may mitigate risk while optimizing patient care and maximizing education.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32348048, From recent Chinese and Italian data, children commonly present mild to moderate disease, a large proportion of them being asymptomatic.
32348048, In particular, children present significantly less fever, cough and pneumonia compared to adults.
32348048, However, more cases of pneumonia were reported from children infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with H1N1.
32348048, No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described so far.
32348046, Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities.
32348046, However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations.
32348046, Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic.
32348046, In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
32348044, Other myeloid neoplasia and their therapies cause imunosupression; dose adjustment is recommended but no brisk stopping.
32348044, Sickle cell anemia patients are highly succeptible to severe COVID-19 course.
32348044, Thrombocytopenia and procoagulant state are associated with severe courses of COVID-19, requiring an individualized therapy.
32348044, No data indicate a risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood product transfusion.
32347991, Once the metal frame set in place, it is wrapped with a single-use clear and sterile cover for surgical C-arm.
32347991, This installation is simple, easy, and fast to achieve and can be carried out with inexpensive material available in every hospital.
32347991, This physical interface is an additional safety measure that prevents the direct projection of secretions or droplets.
32347991, It should, of course, only be considered as a complement to strict compliance with barrier precautions and personal protective equipment.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32347772, Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
32347772, Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
32347772, Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772, South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
32347618, Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission since being closed to the patient.
32347618, Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital.
32347618, Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of our patients were not screened for COVID-19.

32347198, The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement.
32347198, Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.
32347112, The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
32347112, The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
32347112, In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
32347112, Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
32347054, COVID-19 is the first global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, which outbreaks in 211 countries/territories/areas.
32347054, The vaccine against COVID-19, regarded as an effective prophylactic strategy for control and prevention, is being developed in about 90 institutions worldwide.
32347054, The experiences and lessons encountered in the previous SARS and MERS vaccine research can be used for reference in the development of COVID-19 vaccine.
32347054, The present paper hopes to provide some insights for COVID-19 vaccines researchers.
32346664, The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible.
32346664, We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China.
32346664, We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases.
32346664, We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic..
32346656, The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s.
32346656, The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels.Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures.
32346656, This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.© 2020 The Author(s).

32345392,With concerns for presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 and increasing burden of contact tracing and employee furloughs, several hospitals have supplemented pre-existing infection prevention measures with universal masking of all personnel in hospitals.
32345392, Other hospitals are currently faced with the dilemma of whether or not to proceed with universal masking in a time of critical mask shortages.
32345392, We summarize the rationale behind a universal masking policy in healthcare settings, important considerations before implementing such a policy and the challenges with universal masking.
32345392, We also discusses proposed solutions such as universal face shields.
32344679, To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus.
32344679, There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation.
32344679, Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
32344679, This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers.

32343747, Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month.
32343747, While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers.
32343747, These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair).The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19.
32343747, Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.
32343342,The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) global pandemic has already had an unprecedented impact on populations around the world, and is anticipated to have a disproportionate burden on people with schizophrenia and related disorders.
32343342, We discuss the implications of the COVID-19 global pandemic with respect to: (1) increased risk of infection and poor outcomes among people with schizophrenia, (2) anticipated adverse mental health consequences for people with schizophrenia, (3) considerations for mental health service delivery in inpatient and outpatient settings, and (4) potential impact on clinical research in schizophrenia.
32343342, Recommendations emphasize rapid implementation of measures to both decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission and maintain continuity of clinical care and research to preserve safety of both people with schizophrenia and the public.© The Author(s) 2020.

32343300, Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days.Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions.The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures).The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female.
32343300, Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties.
32343300, No adverse events occurred.In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated.
32343300, By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.
32343222, Our results suggest interventions started earlier in the epidemic delay the epidemic curve and interventions started later flatten the epidemic curve.
32343222, We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, 20% of new cases and most hospitalizations and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults.
32343222, However, when interventions ended, the epidemic rebounded.
32343222, Our models suggest that social distancing can provide crucial time to increase healthcare capacity but must occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate virus transmission.
32343122, Nervous system involvement was not initially considered to play a significant role in patients with COVID-19.
32343122, However, since this viewpoint was initially published, multiple studies have been released regarding the possible neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2.
32343122, In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus.
32343122, The past few weeks, after the viewpoint surfaced, it was noticed that it has enabled clinicians and healthcare professionals to compute the neurovirulence associated with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by very recently reported studies.
32342926, Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.
32342926, The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes.
32342926, Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus.
32342926, Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.

32342724, However, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was only isolated from respiratory specimens.
32342724, Here, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from urine of a COVID-19 patient.
32342724, The virus isolated could infect new susceptible cells and was recognized by its' own patient sera.
32342724, Appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid transmission from urine.
32342164, Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced.Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found.
32342164, During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy.
32342164, Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered.As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission.
32342164, Experience shared herein may be useful for those facilities that are and may encounter Covid-19.
32342138, Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake.
32342138, During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination.Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles.
32342138, Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery.
32342138, In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.IV.
32342112, Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic.We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms.
32342112, We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines.
32342112, We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments.
32342112, Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.
32342047, During these turbulent times, it is crucial to understand that while patient and care-providers safety is paramount, canceling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences, and may be irreversibly detrimental to a patient's health and quality of life in some cases.
32342047, The optimal solution of how to effectively balance the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined, and could include strategies such as social distancing, screening forms and tests including temperature screening, segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and health-care providers.
32342047, Of importance, these recommendations do not and should not supersede evolving United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and relevant federal, state and local public health guidelines.

32341722, In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
32341722, Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.

32340912, Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies.In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals.An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners.

32340627, As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients.
32340627, Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure.The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible.
32340627, Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy.
32340627, The safety of healthcare professionals who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating is paramount.
32340538,The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to unprecedented demands on the modern health care system, and the highly contagious nature of the virus has led to particular concerns of infection among health care workers and transmission within health care facilities.
32340538, While strong data regarding the transmissibility of the infection are not yet widely available, preliminary information suggests risk of transmission among asymptomatic individuals, including those within health care facilities.
32340538, We believe that the presence of a tracheostomy or laryngectomy stoma poses a unique risk of droplet and aerosol spread particularly among patients with unsuspected infection.
32340538, At our institution, guidelines for the care of open airways were developed by a multidisciplinary open airway working group, and here we review those recommendations to provide practical guidance to other institutions.
32340347, On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion.
32340347, Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital.
32340347, On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations.
32340347, The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet).
32340347, The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.
32340094, Conclusion: Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19.
32340094, The first-level emergency response initiated by provincial and municipal government was effective and ensured the start of work resumption after the Spring Festival.
32340094, Metropolitans like Shenzhen can also achieve the goals of strategies and measures for containment and mitigation of COVID-19.
32340093, Conclusions: This was a cluster epidemic caused by one imported case of COVID-19 in a supermarket of Liaocheng city.
32340093, Prevention and control of cluster epidemic should be focused on chain of community transmission and family cluster cases.
32340093, It must also be an attention for transmission risk of asymptomatic patients.
32340089, Conclusion: The death of COVID-19 occursmainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases.
32340089, Spleen maybe one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19.
32340089, T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly.
32340089, And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.
32340022, We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures.
32340022, Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols.
32340022, Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols.
32340022, Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus.
32339382, An elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in eight cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection.
32339382, Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases: of these, 7/19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and 4/19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit.
32339382, Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the postpartum period: their newborns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection.
32339382, In one case, a newborn had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery.Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.This study suggests that vaginal delivery may be associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.© 2020 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
32339250, Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening.
32339250, Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation.
32339250, Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus.
32339250, This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.
32338767, This observational study describes the prevalence of their (1) second jobs, and (2) unpaid care work for dependent children and/or adult relatives (double- and triple-duty caregiving) overall and by occupational group (registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], or certified nursing assistants [CNAs]).A descriptive secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study.Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States.A subset of 958 essential facility-based LTC workers involved in direct patient care.We present information on LTC workers' demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double- or triple-duty caregiving roles.Most LTC workers were CNAs, followed by LPNs and RNs.
32338767, Overall, more than 70% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with this statement: "When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work." One-sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and more than 60% held double- or triple-duty caregiving roles.
32338767, Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among CNAs.LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double- and triple-duty caregiving roles.
32338767, To slow the spread of COVID-19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.© 2020 The American Geriatrics Society.
32338533, Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection.
32338533, In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses.
32338533, This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event.
32338533, Potential mechanisms of fetal protection from maternal viral infections are also discussed.
32338347, Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present.
32338347, An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel.
32338347, To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised.
32338347, As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.
32338017, Patients with liver transplantation should be followed closely.
32338017, Digestive endoscopy is a high-risk procedure for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32338017, While the pandemic lasts, we must adapt its indications and promote protective measures for patients and healthcare professionals alike.
32338017, The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our priorities and the way we work, although we do not know what the repercussions will be after normality is reinstated.

32337386, The practices reviewed in this document must be taken in conjunction with local hospital procedures, multidisciplinary recommendations, and regional/national guidelines, as each community may have its unique needs, supplies, and protocols.
32337386, Importantly, as the pandemic evolves, so will the strategies and recommendations.
32337386, Given the unique circumstances for UM patients, along with indications of potential ophthalmologic transmission as a result of healthcare providers working in close proximity to patients and intrinsic infectious risk from eyelashes, tears and hair, practice strategies may be adapted to reduce the risk of viral transmission.
32337386, Certainly, providers and health care systems will continue to examine and provide as safe and effective care as possible for patients in the current environment.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.
32337192, Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
32337192, In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv.
32337192, In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses.
32337192, Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.Copyright: © Journal of Biomedical Physics and Engineering.
32337143, The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
32337143, It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
32337143, Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
32337143, Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.Copyright © 2020, Pal et al.
32337131,The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has gained global attention after it originated from China at the end of 2019, and later turned into pandemic as it affected about 118,000 in 114 countries by March 11, 2020. By March 13, 2020, it was declared a national emergency in the United States as the number of COVID-19 cases, and the death toll rose exponentially.
32337131, To contain the spread of the disease, the world scientist community came together.
32337131, However, the unpreparedness of the nations, even with the advanced medical sciences and resources, has failed to address the mental health aspect amongst the public, as all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32337131, Our efforts in this review are to evaluate and study similar outbreaks from the past to understand its adverse impact on mental health, implement adequate steps to tackle and provide a background to physicians and healthcare workers at the time of such outbreaks to apply psychological first aid.Copyright © 2020, Shah et al.
32336927, SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats.
32336927, Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures.

32336243, The origin of the virus is unknown.
32336243, Airway manipulations and intubations, which are common during anesthesia procedures may increasingly expose anesthesia providers and intensive care unit team members to SARS-CoV-2.
32336243, Through a comprehensive review of existing studies on COVID-19, this article presents the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, reviews current medical management, and suggests ways to improve the safety of anesthetic procedures.
32336243, Owing to the highly contagious nature of the virus and the lack of therapeutic drugs or vaccines, precautions should be taken to prevent medical staff from COVID-19.
32336150, Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures.
32336150, COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection.
32336150, Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced.
32336150, Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.
32336079, The type of mask used when caring for COVID-19 patients will vary according to the setting, type of personnel/person, and activity.
32336079, Although the main transmission route for COVID-19 is droplets, during aerosol generating procedures airborne transmission may occur.
32336079, Keeping the distancing and medical masks and eye protection during close contact efficiently protects against respiratory diseases transmitted via droplets.
32336079, Airborne precautions include goggles and respiratory protection with the use of an N95 or an equivalent mask respirator to prevent airborne transmission.
32336042, Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset.
32336042, The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID-19 were all significant (p < 0.05 for both).Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID-19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms.

32335408, All over the world, flights have been canceled and transport systems have been closed.
32335408, Overall, the economic activities have been stopped and stock markets dropped along with the falling carbon emission.
32335408, However, the lock down of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the air quality in many cities across the globe to improve and drop in water pollutions in some parts of the world.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32335407, The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively.
32335407, Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.
32335407, Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32335334, As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation.
32335334, We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome.
32335334, We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.Copyright © 2020.

32335171, A prolonged period of virus shedding (>30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases.SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters.
32335171, While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly.
32335171, We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32333603, Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact.
32333603, The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department.We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting.
32333603, These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts.
32333603, The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.
32333185, Four decades into the HIV epidemic we have learned a considerable amount of information regarding social and behavioral approaches to addressing disease transmission.
32333185, Here we outline broad, scoping lessons learned from the HIV literature tailored to the nature of what we currently know about COVID-19.
32333185, We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research.
32333185, The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.
32332516, However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs.
32332516, In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles.
32332516, Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission.
32332516, As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis.

32330309,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly around the world.
32330309, Currently, the identification of this disease is mainly conducted by using nasopharyngeal swabs[1] , but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of COVID-19 patients indicates the possibility of transmission via fecal-oral route[2-4] . This article is protected by copyright.

32329971, As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).
32329971, Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.
32329971, More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.

32329522, Today's report (5th April 2020; daily updates in the prepared website) shows that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092, respectively.
32329522, Calculating the total case fatality rate (CFR) of Italy (4th April 2020), about 13.3% of confirmed cases have passed away.
32329522, Compared with South Korea's rate of 1.8% (seven times lower than Italy) and China's 4% (69% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high.
32329522, Some effective policies that yielded significant changes in the trend of cases were the lockdown policy in China, Italy, and Spain (the effect observed after some days), the shutdown of all nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea, and reducing working hours in Iran.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32329337, We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration.
32329337, Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies.
32329337, Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of "fit" and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently.
32329337, Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.
32328595, This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors.
32328595, The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
32328595, The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects.
32328595, This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics.Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.

32327758,We investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism by surveying expression of viral entry-associated genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues from healthy human donors.
32327758, We co-detected these transcripts in specific respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32327758, These genes are co-expressed in nasal epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells' potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance.

32326602, This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19.
32326602, In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection.
32326602, Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32326509, The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration.
32326509, We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT.
32326509, The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis.
32326509, To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.
32326426,Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents, the oral cavity is directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations.
32326426, Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission.
32326426, If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.
32326426, We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of βCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.
32326274, Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely.
32326274, Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%).
32326274, During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all hospice wards in Taiwan changed their visiting policies, but the degree of restriction varied.
32326274, Further studies could measure the impacts of visiting policy changes on patients and healthcare professionals.

32324720, Fifty-five poison centers in the United States provide free, 24-hour professional advice and medical management information regarding exposures to poisons, chemicals, drugs, and medications.
32324720, Call data from poison centers are uploaded in near real-time to NPDS.
32324720, During January-March 2020, poison centers received 45,550 exposure calls related to cleaners (28,158) and disinfectants (17,392), representing overall increases of 20.4% and 16.4% from January-March 2019 (37,822) and January-March 2018 (39,122), respectively.
32324720, Although NPDS data do not provide information showing a definite link between exposures and COVID-19 cleaning efforts, there appears to be a clear temporal association with increased use of these products.
32324530, Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5% (95% CI 36.9%-50.4%).
32324530, The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2% (95% CI 11.6%- 22.0%).
32324530, Of the 97 persons with confirmed COVID-19, only 4 (1.9%) remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine, and none of their household contacts acquired secondary infections.
32324530, Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings.
32323287, In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise.
32323287, Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly.
32323287, For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times.
32323287, If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32323279, Based on our analysis and evaluation of the available findings, we justify our conclusion: important drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should continue to be prescribed according to guidelines to stable patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32322691, Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported.
32322691, We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration.
32322691, Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.Copyright: © 2020 Abbott S et al.
32322401, To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc.
32322401, No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet.
32322401, However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.
32322401, In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32322107, For this purpose, the available literature on cases of infection in pregnancy during the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003, the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic ongoing since 2012, as well as recent publications on cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are reviewed and reported.
32322107, Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate.
32322107, It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely.
32322107, Breastfeeding is possible once infection has been excluded or the disease declared cured.
32321903, The medical staff working in the operating room, such as anesthesiologists, surgeons and nurses, are at high risk of exposure to virus due to closely contacting patients.
32321903, The perioperative management is under great challenge while performing surgeries for patients suffering COVID-19, including emergency cesarean section, which is one of the most common surgeries under such circumstances.
32321903, How to prevent medical staff from cross-infection is an issue of great concern.
32321903, In this article, we give a practice of anesthesia scenario design for emergency cesarean section in a supposed standard patient suffering COVID-19, aimed to optimize the work flow and implement the protective details through simulation of a real operation scenario, which may be useful for training and clinical practice of anesthesia management for patients suffering COVID-19 or other fulminating infectious diseases.

32320687, Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains.
32320687, We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32319446, In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19.
32319446, Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention.
32319446, We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities.
32319446, An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.

32317433, In this paper, we present a preferred practice pattern (PPP) based on consensus discussions between leading ophthalmologists and health care professionals in India including representatives from major governmental and private institutions as well as the All India Ophthalmological Society leadership.
32317433, In this document, the expert panel clearly defines the range of activities for Indian ophthalmologists during the ongoing lockdown phase and precautions to be taken once the lockdown is lifted.
32317433, Guidelines for triage, governmental guidelines for use of personal protective equipment from ophthalmologists' point of view, precautions to be taken in the OPD and operating room as well as care of various ophthalmic equipment have been described in detail.
32317433, These guidelines will be applicable to all practice settings including tertiary institutions, corporate and group practices and individual eye clinics and should help Indian ophthalmologists in performing their professional responsibilities without being foci of disease transmission.

32316751, The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human.
32316751, As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%. There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important.
32316751, In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures.
32316751, We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.
32316618, Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
32316618, COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
32316618, Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
32316618, The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32315808, Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data.
32315808, To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32315756, In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed.
32315756, Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention, or being diagnosed as carriers.
32315756, Thus, managing the asymptomatic subjects, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while the pandemic is looming.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32315244, Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke.
32315244, We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure.
32315244, We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.
32314790, In this review, we discuss what is known about the virology, epidemiology, and disease associated with pediatric infection with the common community-acquired human coronaviruses, including species 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, and the coronaviruses responsible for past world-wide epidemics due to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.© The Author(s) 2020.

32314249, In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery.
32314249, Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging.
32314249, Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
32313879, The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Key Project Grants of the National Science Foundation of China.© 2020 The Author(s).

32313825, With a poorer global health security index compared to China (India-57 and China-51), any such situation will have worse outcome.
32313825, In near future there are also possibilities of similar kind of disease outbreak caused by new strains of coronaviruses due to factors like species jump of new viruses, high population density and inadequate medical facilities.
32313825, In this short review we have highlighted the risk factors and transmission dynamics of coronaviruses that may pose a serious threat to India.
32313825, We have also discussed about the possible preventive measure our country should take to control any such outbreak situation.© Indian Virological Society 2020.
32313785, Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms.
32313785, SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers.
32313785, Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care.
32313785, More research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing aerosol-generating procedures.Copyright © 2020, Sri Santosh et al.
32313361,How do governments in China and Western democracies differ in their technological response to control the transmission of the pandemic? Based on an analysis of academic papers, World Health Organization reports and newspapers, this research compares two opposing approaches, whereas the Chinese cities and government have adopted a techno-driven approach, Western governments have adopted a human-driven approach to control the transmission of Covid-19.
32313361, The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views.
32313361, It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented.
32313361, This paper contributes to literature by understanding the human-technology relationship, and offers five practical observations for controlling virus transmissions during pandemics.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32312364, All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge.Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
32312364, Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed.
32312364, Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis.
32312364, Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.
32312163, Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers.
32312163, However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis.
32312163, The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes.
32312163, Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.
32312021,Given the scope and speed of virus spread, the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and dangerous.
32312021, Complicated objective factors such as the long-term existence of source of infection, difficulty in completely blocking the transmission route and a large susceptible population determined that the COVID-19 pandemic might stay with us for long term.
32312021, Therefore, we should be ready for a tough and long battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.
32312021, The strategy should adhere to the principle of combining emergency response with regular prevention and control measures, and all efforts should be well harnessed in a coordinated way to keep the epidemic under control while securing the economic and social development.
32311771, Healthcare workers should appraise the current evidence regarding transmission and apply this to the local infection prevalence.
32311771, Measures to mitigate airborne transmission should be employed at times of risk.
32311771, However, the mechanisms and risk factors for transmission are largely unconfirmed.
32311771, Whilst awaiting robust evidence, a precautionary approach should be considered to assure healthcare worker safety.© 2020 Association of Anaesthetists.
32311380, If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development).
32311380, Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in health care settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community.
32311380, The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies, and health care professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.Copyright © 2020.

32311350, At the time of the report, 3 pregnancies were ongoing; of the remaining 48 pregnant women, 46 gave birth by cesarean delivery, and 2 gave birth vaginally; in this study, 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death were reported.Although vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and neonates has been generally good, the high rate of preterm delivery by cesarean delivery is a reason for concern.
32311350, Cesarean delivery was typically an elective surgical intervention, and it is reasonable to question whether cesarean delivery for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was warranted.

32311303, Conclusion: This case provides a template for future aerosol-generating procedures during respiratory pandemics.
32311132, Just-in-time economic models resulted in storage of only those supplies needed then.
32311132, At the same time, global purchasing in search of lower prices reduced the number of U.S. suppliers, with hospitals dependent on foreign companies.
32311132, There is still a possibility that the pandemic will be manageably bad rather than unmanageably catastrophic in this country.

32310715, Conclusions: This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.
32310028, Exposed ocular surface can serve as a gateway in transmission and acquiring respiratory diseases.
32310028, Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job.
32310028, In this narrative review we discuss current evidence around detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tears and forms of transmissions reported to date.
32310028, We also provide a comprehensive approach that may be implemented in an ophthalmic care facility to protect healthcare personnel, as well as patients, from contracting the virus.
32308494, The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%).
32308494, Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment.In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan.
32308494, Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people.

32306853, This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV).
32306853, Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR.
32306853, Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.
32306853, In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.

32304561, In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk.
32304561, To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures).
32304561, This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide.
32304561, It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.
32304512, Although use of personal protective equipment is a critical strategy to protect health care personnel from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), other strategies also need to be implemented on labor and delivery units to reduce the risk of health care-associated transmission, including screening of all pregnant women who present for care (case identification), placing a mask on and rapidly isolating ill pregnant women, and minimizing the number of personnel who enter the room of an ill patient (physical distancing).
32304512, Although the mechanism of transmission of COVID-19 is not known with certainty, current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets.
32304512, Therefore, strict adherence to hand hygiene and consistent use of recommended personal protective equipment are cornerstones for reducing transmission.
32304512, In addition, it is critical that health care professionals receive training on and practice correct donning (putting on) and doffing (removing) of personal protective equipment and avoid touching their faces as well as their facial protection to minimize self-contamination.
32304509, We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.
32304509, Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread.
32304509, Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19.
32304509, Multi-directional investigations are crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.
32304508, With respect to the display mode, 47 (42.7%) applications adopted map-view only, 41 (37.3%) table-view only, and 19 (17.3%) both modes.
32304508, Of the remaining three applications, two offered voice user interfaces and one used augmented reality.Taiwan's open data strategy facilitated rapid development of software applications for information dissemination to the public during the COVID-19 crisis.
32304508, The transparency of real-time data could help alleviate the panic of the public.
32304508, The collaborative contributions from the grassroots in disasters were priceless treasures.
32304387, While efforts are underway to contain disease spread and transmission, the authors believe that this is an opportune time to examine and reflect on the impact that medical crises like COVID-19 can have on medical training and education and to evaluate "business continuity plans" to ensure quality medical education even in the face of constant disruptions from pandemic outbreaks.
32304387, Medical training is as important a mandate as patient care and service.
32304387, The authors believe that even in trying times like this, rich and precious lessons can be sought and taught, which will immensely benefit medical students and residents-the health care leaders of tomorrow.
32304387, In this Perspective, the authors discuss the various ways in which the COVID-19 crisis has affected medical instruction in Singapore and explore pertinent practical and creative solutions for the continuity of medical training in these trying times, drawing on their previous experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 as well as the current ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
32304371, Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence.
32304371, This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents.
32304371, All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.
32304371, Therefore, public health literacy is needed.

32303480, In this article we address this relative lack of attention, arguing that enhanced traffic control bundling (eTCB) can and should be adopted and implemented as a means of protecting LTCF residents and staff.
32303480, Enhanced TCB has been widely applied in hospital settings and has proven effective at limiting droplet and fomite transmissions both within hospitals and between hospitals and the general community.
32303480, By effectively adapting eTCB to LTCF conditions, particularly by incorporating compartmentalization within zones plus active surveillance, COVID-19 transmission into and throughout LTCFs can be minimized, thereby saving numerous lives among an especially vulnerable population.Copyright © 2020.

32303077, Vertical transmission has not been confirmed.
32303077, Because no treatment, no vaccine and no herd immunity exist, social distancing is the best mechanism available to protect patients and health care workers from infection.
32303077, This review will discuss what is known about the virus as it relates to pregnancy and then consider management considerations based on these data.
32303077, KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 severity in pregnancy is unclear.. · Social distancing is the best protective mechanism.. · No clear evidence of vertical transmission exists.. · Mother/baby separation avoids transmission..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.
32302953, All were treated with symptomatic support without complications.Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children.

32302399, The COVID-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection.
32302399, Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak.
32302399, Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively.
32302399, However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
32302377, Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could have been prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible.Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger for the transmission of 2019-nCoV infection in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to control the epidemic.© The Author(s) 2020.

32302257, The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed.
32302257, Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.
32302257, COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.
32302257, Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.
32302216, The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission.
32302216, Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization.
32302216, It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission.
32302216, As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.
32302058, During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
32302058, In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
32302058, In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.

32301390, Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection.
32301390, We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function.
32301390, It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases.
32301390, The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.
32300968, Radiological examinations were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19.
32300968, It is reported that some radiologists and radiological technologists were infected when giving examinations to the patients with COVID-19.
32300968, In order to reduce the infection risk of medical staff in radiology department, we summarized the experience on prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work for radiologists and radiological technologists.
32300968, KEY POINTS: • The novel coronavirus spreads rapidly through droplet and contact transmission. • Radiologists and radiological technologists were possibly infected by patients. • Prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19 are important.
32300673, We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C>T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T>C in ORF8 gene and 29095C>T in the N gene.
32300673, The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.

32300101, Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice.
32300101, So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time.
32300101, Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination.
32300101, This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.
32300018, We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations.
32300018, This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.
32300018, We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted forecasting of hospitalization and critical care needs.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

32299206, Its case fatality rate was 6.3, but it was different in different ages and counties, and it could be over 15%. According to early models total 10–12 weeks is required to control an outbreak in the community.
32299206, While different countries show different daily case numbers, total number of case, case mortality rates or R0, it seems they show a similar epidemic curve.
32299206, Every day we learn new data about the current outbreak.
32299206, Since the outbreak is not over yet, every detail should be evaluated carefully and the updates should be followed closely to monitor the epidemiological properties of COVID-19.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
32299205, During the care of these patients, HCP should wear their personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with the procedure and should not neglect hand hygiene.
32299205, The samples of the patient with known or suspected COVID-19, patient should also be known to be risky in terms of contamination, and a risk assessment should be performed for the procedures to be performed in laboratories.
32299205, The PPE should be used in accordance with the procedure to be performed.
32299205, The protection of the HCP, who sacrifice at the risk of life, is possible only by complying with infection control and precautions.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
32298643,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection spreads globally, the demand for chest imaging will inevitably rise with an accompanying increase in risk of disease transmission to frontline radiology staff.
32298643, Radiology departments should implement strict infection control measures and robust operational plans to minimize disease transmission and mitigate potential impact of possible staff infection.

32298273, Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney.
32298273, And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3.
32298273, In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs.
32298273, And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.
32298250, On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases.
32298250, Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC.
32298250, Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.
32298250, Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.
32298249, To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results.
32298249, Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient.
32298249, Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.
32298249, Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.
32298246, Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts were interviewed to better understand nonhousehold, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32298246, This report describes the cluster of 16 cases of confirmed or probable COVID-19, including three deaths, likely resulting from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at two family gatherings (a funeral and a birthday party).
32298246, These data support current CDC social distancing recommendations intended to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32298246, U.S residents should follow stay-at-home orders when required by state or local authorities.
32298208, MTS was officially launched for 37 days, during which it has been used 3,061 times.Conclusions:The building of the MTS not only provides convenience and benefit for health care professionals, but also reduces person-to-person contact.
32298055, Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response.
32298055, Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates.
32298055, Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes.
32298055, This review discusses the mechanisms of proliferation and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses based on the results of existing research, providing basis for future study on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of human highly pathogenic coronaviruses.
32298036, In the present commentary, we provide a framework for prioritizing head and neck surgery during the pandemic.
32298036, Unique considerations for the head and neck patient are examined including risk to the oncology patient, outcomes following delay in head and neck cancer therapy, and risk of transmission during otolaryngologic surgery.
32298036, Our case prioritization criteria consist of four categories: urgent-proceed with surgery, less urgent-consider postpone > 30 days, less urgent-consider postpone 30 to 90 days, and case-by-case basis.
32298036, Finally, we discuss our preoperative clinical pathway for transmission mitigation including defining low-risk and high-risk surgery for transmission and role of preoperative COVID-19 testing.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32298029, Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer.
32298029, Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.
32298029, Treatment strategies were discussed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board.

32297723, At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32297723, Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
32297723, Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
32297723, Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
32297593, This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed.A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020.Videos in the January and March samples were viewed >125 million times and >355 million times, respectively.
32297593, Fewer than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed.
32297593, There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample.This study demonstrates the incredible reach of YouTube and the potential value of partnership with the entertainment industry for communicating and mobilizing the public about community mitigation to reduce mortality from the COVID-19 viral pandemic.©Charles E Basch, Corey H Basch, Grace C Hillyer, Christie Jaime.

32296808, Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses.
32296808, Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging.
32296808, We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation.The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow.
32296808, This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.
32296777, The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan.
32296777, Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact.
32296777, The scale of the problem is massive.
32296777, Here I consider new approaches to improve patient's biological resistance to COVID-19 using stem cells, and how benefit might be scaled and simplified using synthetic stem cells to meet logistical needs within a short time frame.Crown Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.
32296168,We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and modeled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs.
32296168, We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset.
32296168, We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 25-69%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home.
32296168, Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.
32295323, It is emphasized that the indications for sleep study and NIPAP should be strictly defined according to the local epidemic situation.
32295323, Portable home sleep study and auto-titration positive airway pressure is recommended.
32295323, The applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer for sleep study and disposable or personal masks and ventilator tubing for NIPAP are strongly suggested.
32295323, Moreover, it is necessary to standardize the procedure of NIPAP, to separate the functional divisions in sleep lab, to comply with the protection regulations for medical personnel, and to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection management.
32294813, A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
32294813, As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32294813, Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32294813, When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
