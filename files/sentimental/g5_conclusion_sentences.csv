32472991, As far as infection pathophysiology is still not completely clarified, this review focuses also on the cardiovascular (CV) implication of COVID-19 and the capability of this virus to cause direct myocardial injury, myocarditis and other CV manifestations.
32472991, Furthermore, we highlight the relationship between the virus, enzyme ACE2 and ACE inhibitors.
32472991, Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
32472991, Aim of this review is then to summarize what is actually known about the SARS-CoV2 and its cardiovascular implications.
32472990,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which recently has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having killed almost 250,000 people worldwide as of May 4th 2020.
32472990, Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is now evident that it may also affect the cardiovascular system in multiple ways.The current paper is a review of the most recent literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated main cardiovascular clinical manifestations.Cardiovascular disease represents a prevalent underlying comorbidity associated with increased mortality rates among COVID-19 affected individuals.
32472990, In addition, various cardiovascular manifestations have been linked to the viral insult, including among others acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, acute heart failure, cardiac injury, arrhythmias and acute pulmonary embolism.Further studies are required in order to establish the complicated association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects on the cardiovascular system.
32472990, Our knowledge regarding diagnostic approaches, therapeutic management and preventive measures is constantly enriched throughout an abundance of ongoing research in the respective fields.
32472773, Unlike the closed system that characterizes an intubated patient attached to a respiratory circuit, non-invasive ventilatory support threatens an increased risk of permeating the clinical workspace with airborne viral particles.
32472773, Patients with sleep apnea may mandatorily require non-invasive ventilation strategies to see them through a respiratory illness.
32472773, In this infographic, the considerations and general principles of managing non-invasive ventilation in such a scenario are outlined.
32472773, The reader is encouraged to review the article in its entirety for a full depth of understanding.
32472745, We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; one study (a non-peer-reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in milk.
32472745, Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk.

32472516, We described three COVID-19 patients in ICU at Federico II Hospital in Naples that, although had recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation.
32472516, Our clinical evaluation was consistent with an involvement of the brainstem and especially of respiratory centre thus possibly explaining the weaning failure in patients that were awake and had recovered from lung involvement.
32472516, Our data, though limited, indicate that brainstem involvement may play a role in respiratory failure and perhaps in the high death rate of COVID-19 patients.
32472516, Moreover, the weaning failure from mechanical ventilation due to central respiratory drive depression might underlie the unusual long stay in ICU reported for COVID-19 patients.
32472459, Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19.
32472459, Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach.
32472459, Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients.
32472459, We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points• Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.• No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.• A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.• Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.
32472454, We analyse the impact of the pandemic on the conduct of phase I-II trials for paediatric cancer during the first month of state of alarm in Spain.A questionnaire was sent to all five ITCC-accredited Spanish Paediatric Oncology Early Phase Clinical Trial Units, including questions about impact on staff activities, recruitment, patient care, supply of investigational products, and legal aspects.All units suffered personnel shortages and difficulties in enrolling patients, treatment continuity, or performing trial assessments.
32472454, Monitoring activity was frequently postponed (73%), and 49% of on-going trials interrupted recruitment.
32472454, Only two patients could be recruited during this period (75% reduction in the expected rate).The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted clinical research practice and access to innovation for children with cancer.
32472454, Structural and functional changes are under way to better cope with the expected future restrictions.
32472403, Respondents agree that the switch from minimally invasive to open technique can be considered as a valid option for cases with a high technical complexity.
32472403, Several issues merit specific attention: screening for virus positivity should be universally performed; only expert surgical teams should operate on positive patients and specific technical measures to lower the biological risk of contamination during surgery must be followed.
32472403, Future studies specifically designed to establish the true risks in minimally invasive surgery are suggested.
32472403, Furthermore, a standard and univocal process of prioritization of patients from Regional Healthcare Systems is advisable.
32472325,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly impacted healthcare services around the world.

32471066, In conclusion, a rapid adoption of ICP and regular audits of quality indicators for the management of COVID-19 patients might be important tools to improve the quality of care and outcomes.
32470885, In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.To determine the analytical performance of the ID NOW assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.Residual NP samples collected in viral transport media were tested by the ID NOW platform in two independent laboratories.
32470885, Results were compared to either the CDC or New York EUA assays, which served as reference methods.Overall agreement of ID NOW was 78.7%. Sensitivity was 71.7% and specificity was 100%. Notably, all false-negative results correlated to those samples that were weakly positive.ID NOW performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has reduced sensitivity for weakly positive samples.

32470088, Overall approximately one third of respondents had significant psychological impact (IES-R score > 24).
32470088, Higher psychological impact was predicted with younger age, female gender and comorbid physical illness.
32470088, Presence of physical symptoms and contact history predicted higher psychological impact, but did not reach statistical significance.During the initial stages of COVID-19 in India, almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact.
32470088, This indicates a need for more systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs of the population, which can help the government in formulating holistic interventions for affected individuals.
32469854, We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: "Which patients to attend", "How should the clinic work", and "What interventions should be avoided". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed.Fourteen relevant articles were found.
32469854, Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table.
32469854, None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations.The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments.
32469854, The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.
32469732, Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones.

32469387, Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well.This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis.
32469387, Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier.
32469387, The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported.Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms.
32469387, Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.
32469297, We propose a four-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions.
32469297, While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns.
32469297, Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those that recover form COVID-19, healthcare professionals and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption.
32469297, The important thing is to have a systematic plan to support behavioral health and to engage citizens in the prevention and doing their part in recovery by staying home and protecting others.
32469253, Conclusions:In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic and RV function are impaired.
32469253, Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function.
32469253, In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without DVT, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in ≈20%.
32469194, To verify the effect of the program, an experimental training with pre- and post-test was conducted before large-scale training.Post-test scores were significantly improved when compared with the pre-test scores.
32469194, Among all PPE, N95 respirator and protective coverall needed training most.
32469194, Meanwhile, "proficiency level" and "mutual check & help" also needed to be strengthened as independent scoring points.This training program significantly improved the performances of participants.
32469194, It may therefore be applied for general HCWs on a larger scale.
32469096, We have performed an early review of this service to ensure its sustainability during the unknown duration of this current crisis and to establish its potential utility when normal services resume in the future.
32469096, Our results show a patient satisfaction of 93% with 83% happy to have telephone follow-up in the future and a clinician satisfaction of 82% in adequacy of the telephone consultation in making a clinical decision.
32469096, Telephone clinics are a safe and efficient alternative to face-to-face outpatient consultations for many patients, particularly non-complex benign follow-ups.This article is protected by copyright.

32469045, An exploratory statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t test.During the pandemic period, the number of new order verifications decreased from approximately 5,000 orders per day to 3,300 orders per day (P < 0.01), a reduction of 30% during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to the weeks prior.
32469045, Average daily pharmacokinetic dosing consults were reduced in the pandemic period (from 82 to 67; P < 0.01) compared to the prepandemic period; however, total daily pharmacist interventions did not differ significantly (473 vs 456; P = 0.68).
32469045, Dispensing of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, enoxaparin, and sedative medications increased substantially during the pandemic period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons).The operational and clinical requirements of an inpatient pharmacy department shifted considerably during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32469045, Pharmacy departments must be adaptable in order to continue to provide effective pharmaceutical care during the pandemic.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2020.
32468851, Immunotherapy restores immunological activity against cancer cells and it has become a standard treatment for several cancers.
32468851, We carried out an examination of available data concerning with the effects exerted by both SARS-CoV-2 and the most widespread immunotherapy treatments on the immune system in order to hypothesize mechanisms underlying potential and mutual interaction.
32468851, We provided an analysis of laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32468851, We finally focused on implications of immunotherapy treatments in clinical practice.
32468775, Respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, fatigue, breathing difficulties and bilateral lung infiltrates on C.T are common findings.
32468775, Pakistan so far has not reported any confirmed case of COVID-19.
32468775, Government is showing its commitment towards the threat of importation.
32468775, This novel coronavirus, called as a "devil" by Chinese Prime Minister, Xi Ping is really an enigma.
32468710, While some of these trials will need to restart, others can re-start at different points along the trial protocol with substantial protocol amendments.
32468710, However, there is an urgent need to combine useful information from the completers with those subjects undergoing complex protocols deviations and amendments after re-start.
32468710, We propose the concept of mechanistic modeling-based virtual twin patients as a possible solution to harmonize the readouts from these complex and fragmented clinical datasets in a biologically relevant way.This article is protected by copyright.

32468425, Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations.
32468425, Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions.The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations.
32468425, Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32468425, Clinical prudence is required in advocating HCQ as a therapeutic armamentarium in COVID-19.
32468414,Following the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the Covid-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, health organisations and staff have had to adapt and restructure services in order to respond to this global health emergency.
32468414, Numerous containment strategies have been, and continue to be, introduced in this rapidly evolving and fluid situation with a significant shift towards virtual or remote patient assessment.
32468414, The concept of virtual patient evaluation has previously been adopted across a range of medical and surgical specialities yielding safe and efficient pathways associated with good Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and patient satisfaction rates.
32468414, Whilst the idea of virtual patient review may be perceived as counterintuitive to the basic foundations and principles of face-to-face clinical practice, the current global pandemic, now more than ever, highlights the importance, need and benefits of this care model.
32468202, Cardiovascular complications, venous thromboembolism and pneumonia occurred in one, two and one patient, respectively.
32468202, Three and two patients developed pre-operative and postoperative fevers, respectively.We introduced a novel clinical pathway for pre-operatively screening of COVID-19 in traumatic orthopaedic patients.
32468202, The delay in surgery caused by COVID-19 screening was minimized to a point at which reasonable and acceptable clinical outcomes were achieved.
32468202, Doctors should pay more attention to perioperative complications, such as cardiovascular complications, venous thromboembolism, pneumonia and fever.
32468196, This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) compared with the placebo group (26%); however, more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%).Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe COVID-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation.
32468196, There is limited safety data for remdesivir, which should be obtained in further studies.
32468196, The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed.
32468196, Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.
32468052, CTSL was upregulated in lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma, oesophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lower grade glioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thymoma.
32468052, Hypo‑methylation of both genes was evident in most cases where they have been highly upregulated.
32468052, We have expanded on our observations by including data relating to mutations and copy number alterations at pan‑cancer level.
32468052, The novel hypotheses that are stemming out of these data need to be further investigated and validated in large clinical studies.
32468014, Despite the very fast and large flow of scientific data on possible treatment solutions, none have yet demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
32468014, This work represents an exhaustive and critical review of all available data on potential treatments for COVID‑19, highlighting their mechanistic characteristics and the strategy development rationale.
32468014, Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, and target based methods are the most used strategies to advance therapeutic solutions into clinical practice.
32468014, Current in silico, in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding proposed treatments are summarized providing strong support for future research efforts.
32467810, Most of the data points to the very challenging nature of treating such patients.
32467810, Their overall outcomes seem to be worse than in the general population, and it may be difficult to differentiate which potential complications are a result of the primary oncologic disease versus the infection.
32467810, Management presents its own set of challenges, including but not limited to, deciding whether postponing cancer treatment until the infection resolves is going to benefit the patient and how to organize all aspects of patient care when social contact is as limited as it is for patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19.
32467810, We believe that as more data becomes available, it is going to be necessary to publish detailed guidelines on how to approach this unique clinical challenge.Copyright © 2020, Cancarevic et al.
32467443, In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended.
32467443, The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system.
32467443, Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients.
32467443, D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.
32467359, Viral RNA copy number dropped by 50-66% after 80°C heating for 20 min.
32467359, Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min.
32467359, These results indicated that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false negative results especially in weakly positive cases.
32467359, Thus, TRIzol is recommended for sample inactivation in comparison to heat inactivation as Trizol has the least effect on RNA copy number among the tested methods.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32467191, The most common imaging findings were nonspecific white matter microangiopathy (134/55.4%), chronic infarct (47/19.4%), acute or subacute ischemic infarct (13/5.4%), and acute hemorrhage (11/4.5%).
32467191, No patients imaged for altered mental status demonstrated acute ischemic infarct or acute hemorrhage.
32467191, White matter microangiopathy was associated with higher 2-week mortality (P < .001).

32467113, By end of follow-up, 18 patients (31%) died a median 6 days after hospitalization, including 75% of patients who required mechanical ventilation.
32467113, Eleven of those who died had advanced directives against intubation.
32467113, The remaining 41 patients (69%) were discharged home a median 8 days after admission.
32467113, The median initial white blood cell count was significantly higher in patients who died compared with those still living (7.5 versus 5.7×103/μl), as was C-reactive protein (163 versus 80 mg/L).The association of COVID-19 with high mortality in patients with ESKD on dialysis reinforces the need to take appropriate infection control measures to prevent COVID-19 spread in this vulnerable population.Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.

32466736, Five received intravenous alteplase.
32466736, All patients had mechanical thrombectomy.
32466736, Nine patients achieved successful recanalization (mTICI2B-3), none experienced early neurological improvement, 4 had early cerebral reocclusion, and a total of 6 patients (60%) died in the hospital.Best medical care including early intravenous thrombolysis, and successful and prompt recanalization achieved with mechanical thrombectomy, resulted in poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
32466736, Although our results require further confirmation, a different pharmacological approach (antiplatelet or other) should be investigated to take in account inflammatory and coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19.
32466735, The COVID-19 patients with medical history of stroke were older with more comorbidities, had higher neutrophil count, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts than those without history of stroke.
32466735, The levels of D-dimers, cardiac troponin I, NT pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and interleukin-6 were also markedly higher in patients with history of stroke.
32466735, Stroke survivors who underwent COVID-19 developed more acute respiratory distress syndrome and received more noninvasive mechanical ventilation.
32466735, Data from propensity-matched analysis indicated a higher proportion of patients with COVD-19 with a history of stroke were admitted to the intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation and were more likely to be held in the unit or die, compared with non-stroke history COVID-19 patients.Patients with COVID-19 with a history of stroke had more severe clinical symptoms and poorer outcomes compared with those without a history of stroke.
32466623, Paired FEV1 measurements were included if the measurement on the home monitor was performed on the same day as the FEV1 measurement on the pneumotachometer during a two monthly clinical visit.
32466623, Bland-Altman plots and linear mixed model analysis were used.
32466623, The mean difference (home measurement was subtracted from clinical measurement) in FEV1 was 0.18 L in CF (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.27 L; p < 0.001) and 0.12 L in asthma (95%CI 0.05-0.19 L; p < 0.001).
32466623, FEV1 measurements at home were significantly lower than clinically obtained FEV1 measurements, which has implications for the application of this technique in the daily clinical situation.
32466477, Regarding journals, the JournalofVirology has contributed the most, while in terms of researchers, Yuen Kwok Yung has made the most contributions.

32464662, Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience.To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis.We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population.
32464662, The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home.Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units.
32464662, Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients.Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow.

32464297, Despite the fact that COVID-19 rarely caused any severe disease in children, the asymptomatic children might be playing an important role for spreading COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.
32464297, This review aimed at sharing our experience of how to handle patients with COVID-19 in a pediatric referral and tertiary care hospital to prevent the possible transmissions to the healthcare workers (HCWs).This review sought to identify infection control practices measures during COVID-19 pandemic comes from our daily practice combined with the most recent guidelines with the new experience and information.Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, four primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment.Infection control precautions to prevent the possible transmissions to HCWs as well as the other patients and their caregivers from children with COVID-19 are very critical.
32464297, If sufficient precautions are not taken, healthcare settings may serve as additional source of transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the society.Copyright © 2020.

32464271, Nevertheless, it is also plausible that the SARS-CoV-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the obvious death disparities around the world.
32464271, Current research literature linking the genetic make-up of SARS-CoV-2 with fatality is lacking.
32464271, Here, we suggest that this disparity in fatality rates may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 evolving mutations and urge the international community to begin addressing the phylogenetic clade classification of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2020.

32463809, Fourteen of the 19 residents with COVID-19 were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
32463809, Among these residents, eight developed symptoms 1-5 days after specimen collection and were later classified as presymptomatic; one of these patients died.
32463809, This report describes an outbreak of COVID-19 in an SNF, with case identification accomplished by implementing several rounds of RT-PCR testing, permitting rapid isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic residents with COVID-19.
32463809, The outbreak was successfully contained following implementation of this strategy.
32463803, Off-label treatment with tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of NK cells.In conclusion, the association between IL-6 serum levels and the impairment of cytotoxic activity suggests the possibility that targeting this cytokine may restore anti-viral mechanisms.This study was supported by funds of Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine of University of Florence (ex-60%) derived from Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca (Italy).
32463545, Primary outcome of the study was to assess the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and obesity classes according to BMI.92 patients (61.9% males; age 70.5±13.3 years) were enrolled.
32463545, Patients with overweight and obesity were younger than normal-weight patients (68.0±12.6 and 67.0±12.6 years vs. 76.1±13.0 years, p<0.01).
32463545, A higher need for assisted ventilation beyond pure oxygen support (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation or Non-Invasive Ventilation) and a higher admission to intensive or semi-intensive care units was observed in patients with overweight and obesity (p<0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) even after adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively), or when patients with dementia or advanced cancer were removed from the analysis (p<0.05).Patients with overweight and obesity admitted in a medical ward for SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive or semi-intensive care units than normal weight patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32463395, Clinical presentations and pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 are broad.
32463395, The respiratory aspect of the disease has been extensively researched.
32463395, Emerging studies point out the possibility of the central nervous system (CNS) involvement by COVID-19.
32463395, Here, we discuss the current evidence for CNS involvement in COVID-19 and highlight that the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to its neuroinvasive potential.
32463348, Conclusions Overall 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone.
32463348, The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.
32463308, Chloroquine interacts with multiple cardiac ion channels including the hERG potassium channel that is essential for normal electrical activity in the heart.
32463308, A reduction in hERG channel potassium current is the principle cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome.
32463308, Azithromycin also can cause modest QT interval prolongation, but not through potent hERG channel blockade, rather when used chronically through an increase in peak and late cardiac sodium current to cause potential loading of cardiomyocytes with sodium and calcium to produce calcium overload.
32463308, How should we proceed with the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially combined with azithromycin, for COVID-19 given that these agents bring some cardiac toxicity risk and their mechanisms for cardiac toxicity may not be the same? Is combining different and potentially additive mechanisms of cardiotoxicity wise? How great the risk is relative to the benefit in critically ill COVID-19 patients will need to await the outcome of ongoing, controlled clinical trials.
32463186, The pronounced pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses observed in these patients may contribute to a transient hypercoagulable state.
32463186, In this setting, pulmonary embolism may cause further respiratory distress and clinical deterioration.We describe the clinical course of three patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress, where pulmonary embolism was detected during the course of the hospitalisation.
32463186, Two of the cases occurred despite early institution of standard dosage of low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis, and in one case, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed during the convalescent phase of an otherwise benign COVID-19 disease course.These cases highlight the importance of awareness of the potentially increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 disease.
32463186, Further research is required to establish appropriate clinical management guidelines for prevention of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.
32463179, In summary, we found no evidence that DPP-4i might affect hospitalization for COVID-19.

32463026, Prior studies have demonstrated that the destructive neurological effects of rabies virus (RABV) infections are mediated by CNS transport of the virus tightly bound to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR).
32463026, By comparison, it has been hypothesized that a similar mechanism exists to explain the multiple neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 via binding to peripheral nAChRs followed by orthograde or retrograde transport into the CNS.
32463026, Genetic engineering of the RABV has been employed to generate novel vaccines consisting of non-replicating RABV particles expressing chimeric capsid proteins containing human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), Ebolavirus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) sequences.
32463026, Accordingly, we present a critical discussion that integrates lessons learned from prior RABV research and vaccine development into a working model of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that selectively targets and neutralizes CNS penetration of a tightly bound viral nAChR complex.
32462990, The patient was treated with catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) and recovered completely.
32462990, Coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 is present in all severe cases and is a dynamic process.
32462990, We describe a case of massive/high risk pulmonary embolism, in a patient with COVID-19 receiving full anticoagulation, who was treated by percutaneous intervention.
32462990, CDT can be an additional therapeutic option in patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism that present with rapid clinical collapse.
32462970, The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2µM and 30µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin respectively.
32462970, Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than uridine monophosphate (UMP).
32462970, Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å2 by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide.
32462970, However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.Abbreviation: COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease 2019; PCA: Principal Component Analysis; MD: Molecular Dynamics; MM/PBSA: Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area; nCoV: Novel Coronavirus; PME: Particle-Mesh Ewald; RMSD: Root Mean Square Deviations; RMSF: Root Mean Square Fluctuations; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2; SASA: Solvent Accessible Surface Area; SPC: Simple Point Charge.

32462545, There were insufficient data to compare across treatments.
32462545, Many treatments have been administered to the first 9152 reported cases of COVID-19.
32462545, These data serve as the basis for an open-source registry of all reported treatments given to COVID-19 patients at www.CDCN.org/CORONA.
32462545, Further work is needed to prioritize drugs for investigation in well-controlled clinical trials and treatment protocols.
32462468, The pathology of COVID-19, including the exact infection route, remains largely unknown.
32462468, Given the unavailability of an effective cure and vaccine, people are required to respond to this adversity without becoming complacent.
32462468, The global efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing endeavors, far from over.
32462468, New epidemiological data and clinical findings are emerging on a daily basis, making it critical to always refer to the latest information.
32462423, Patients with SSc need a close follow-up with a regular screening of organ involvement and frequent intravenous treatments.
32462423, All SSc patients have been educated about ministerial directives to limit COVID-19 spread.
32462423, The organization of our Scleroderma Unit has been quickly rethought to assure SSc patients assistance in safety for them and for health-care workers during urgent visits or infusion therapies.
32462423, Using electronic way of communication with frequent virtual contact and guarantying home deliveries of some therapies, we allowed a continuity of care also outside the Hospital.
32462412, The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established.Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease.
32462412, These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection.
32462412, Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy.
32462412, Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.
32462378, Common symptoms included fever (15 cases), cough (21 cases), and fatigue (7 cases).
32462378, The blood lymphocyte count decreased in 84.6% of the patients (median: 0.765 × 109/L).
32462378, Chest CT revealed ground-glass-like lesions in 18 cases, unilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, bilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, and pleural effusion in 2 cases.Only 46.875% of the hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had fever in the early stage; and diabetics may be the most susceptible population.
32462378, A decrease in blood lymphocyte count and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scan is beneficial in identifying the high-risk population.
32462354, Cardiac enzymes were also elevated, suggesting myocarditis.
32462354, He was treated with inotropic support, respiratory support with high flow nasal cannula, IV immunoglobulins, aspirin, steroids and diuretics.
32462354, RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative twice.
32462354, His clinical condition improved rapidly, was afebrile from day 2, inflammatory parameters decreased, left ventricular function improved and was discharged after 6 d of hospital stay.
32462195, All swab types tested with the Abbott assay produced concordant results.
32462195, Polymerase chain reaction assays had approximately 10 to 100 times lower limits of detection than Abbott ID NOW.Based on these evaluations, a multiplatform testing approach is proposed, depending on patient population and assay sensitivity, to address testing needs during a public health emergency.© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

32461981, We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R0t .The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R0t is still larger than the threshold 1.
32461981, The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan.
32461981, Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP.
32461981, Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Yu Zhao et al.
32461973, Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain.
32461973, Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target.
32461973, Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Miyssa I.

32461554, After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine.
32461554, Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A).
32461554, Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis.In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects.
32461554, Further research is warranted to investigate whether colchicine's IL-6 suppressive effects may be beneficial in COVID-19.
32461415, Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%).
32461415, The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%).
32461415, Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients.Tracking of tele-consultations and access to patient information from the electronic medical records enabled a timely response in an ongoing lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32461415, The current experience provided valuable insights to the possibility of managing patient follow-up visits remotely in the future.
32461326, The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU.
32461326, Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient.
32461326, As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home.In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was lower than in previously published studies.
32461326, These data suggest that the prognosis associated with critical illness due to COVID-19 may not be as poor as previously reported.Joule Inc. or its licensors.
32461325, Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records.
32461325, Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire.Among 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2-64.5] yr).
32461325, The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0-359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9-29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.6).We found a strong association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
32461325, These symptoms should be considered as common and distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should serve as an indication for testing and possible retesting of people whose first test result is negative.Joule Inc. or its licensors.
32461285, NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).Conclusion: Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement.
32461285, However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load.
32461285, The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32461198, Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.
32461198, Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself.
32461198, The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32461068, The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003.Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
32461068, Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak.
32461068, The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p<0.001).Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020.

32460829, At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19.
32460829, All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities.
32460829, In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (> 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.
32460829, Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.
32460632, Conclusions: Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients.
32460632, Recognition and antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.
32460624, Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: "mild",symbolized as a "drizzle" of cytokines, severe as a "storm", and critical as a "hurricane". In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage.
32460624, In severe phenotype, resembling a "cytokine-release syndrome", SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32460624, In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure.
32460624, In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.
32460433, Risk factors for declination of redeployment included current redeployment, having children, and concerns regarding ability to reach case minimums.
32460433, Risk factors for concern of achieving operative autonomy included cancellation of elective cases and higher level of training.Several potential actions, which could be taken by urology residency program directors and hospital administration, may optimize urology resident well-being, morale, and education.
32460433, These include advocating for adequate access to PPE, providing support at both the residency program and institutional levels, instituting telehealth education programs, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility of COVID-19 patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32460417, The new disease caused primarily symptoms of a respiratory tract infection with cough, shortness of breath, and viral pneumonia.
32460417, The clinical spectrum showed mostly mild symptoms with some patients developing bilateral pneumonia needing partly intensive care treatment and causing death(1).
32460417, It became apparent, that this new disease was highly contagious, and - intensive care - patients numbers were rapidly rocketing, overwhelming the capacity of local health care facilities.This article is protected by copyright.

32460390, In 57% of patients, the immunosuppressive therapy was not changed and only 3 patients were treated with chloroquine.
32460390, Most patients recovered without experimental anti-viral therapy.Modification of the immunosuppressive regimen alone could be a therapeutic option for SOT recipients suffering from moderate to severe COVID-19.

32460369,Since there is still no definitive conclusion regarding which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most effective and safe in viral respiratory infections, we decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections so that we can reach a conclusion on which NSAID is best choice for COVID-19.A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020.
32460369, Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included.Six clinical trials were included.
32460369, No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections.
32460369, Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections.
32460369, In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalization in patients with pneumonia due to influenza.Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence.
32460369, Naproxen may be a good choice for future clinical trials.This article is protected by copyright.

32460302, However, due to specific characteristics of COVID-19 (e.g., rapidly expanding lung lesions), a single imaging method such as lung POCUS will have significant limitations.
32460302, Herein, we suggest a Tri-POCUS approach that represents concurrent bedside assessment of the lungs, heart, and the venous system.
32460302, This combinational approach is likely to overcome the limitations of the individual methods and provide a more precise evaluation of the volume status in critically ill patients with COVID-19.© 2020 S.

32460144, In the severely affected patients, it has caused dysregulation of immune responses including over-secretion of inflammatory cytokines and imbalances in the proportion of naïve helper T cells, memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells.
32460144, Identification of the underlying mechanism of such aberrant function of immune system would help in the prediction of disease course and selection of susceptible patients for more intensive cares.

32460086, In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values<0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32460086, Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. (RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005).The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.

32459978, USPs observed the hospital air ventilation and distance from the nearest hand-washing facilities to each clinical setting, then mimicked symptoms of either tuberculosis or influenza before observing the HCW's behavior.
32459978, A total of 480 clinical-setting assessments were made by 19 USPs.The overall adequacy of triage services was 86.7% and for prevention of the spread of airborne droplets was 83.5%. Almost all hospitals offered adequate air ventilation.
32459978, Compared to the information desk, adequacy of triage and preventing the spread of airborne droplets by physicians in the three clinical departments was less likely to be adequate.
32459978, Triage services for USPs simulating symptoms of influenza were 2.6 times more likely to be adequate than for those simulating symptoms of tuberculosis but there was no significant difference in the prevention of the spread of airborne droplets.There is a need to improve respiratory infectious disease procedures in our study hospitals, especially in outpatient and emergency departments.
32459919, By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54% in the 10-day group.
32459919, After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P = 0.14).
32459919, The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%).In patients with severe Covid-19 not requiring mechanical ventilation, our trial did not show a significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir.
32459919, With no placebo control, however, the magnitude of benefit cannot be determined. (Funded by Gilead Sciences; GS-US-540-5773 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04292899.).Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.
32459916, Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6% were black.
32459916, In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts.
32459916, However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs. white race, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17).In a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31% of the Ochsner Health population.
32459916, Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission.Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.
32459857, We support the recommendation of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis for inpatients with COVID-19 as a very minimum in the absence of strict contraindications, while recognising that pulmonary thrombotic complications can occur under standard thromboprophylaxis.
32459857, We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with COVID-19 where a discrepant evolution of C-reactive protein and D-dimer is observed.
32459857, Therapeutic levels of anticoagulation are obligatory where new evidence of a macrovascular thrombotic complication has been documented.
32459857, More research to delineate the macro- and microvascular thrombotic complications of COVID-19, and the therapeutic implications for this patient group is required.
32459793, Subsequent to this high-realism difficult airway simulation was a real-life difficult airway event in a patient suspected of coronavirus disease 2019 less than 12 hours later, validating potential failure points and effectiveness of rapidly generated guidance.A number of potential workflow challenges were identified during tabletop and physical in situ manikin-based simulations.
32459793, Experienced clinicians served as participants, debriefed, and provided feedback that was incorporated into local site clinical pathways, job aids, and suggested practices.
32459793, Clinical management of an actual suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient with difficult airway demonstrated very similar success and anticipated failure points.
32459793, Following debriefing and assembly of a success/failure grid, a coronavirus disease 2019 airway bundle template was created using these simulations and clinical experiences for others to adapt to their sites.Integration of tabletop planning, in situ simulations, and debriefing of real coronavirus disease 2019 cases can enhance planning, training, job aids, and feasible policies/procedures that address human factors, team communication, equipment choice, and patient/provider safety in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic era.
32459792, In addition, non-physician healthcare providers were the largest group of users (46%) of the combination of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags.
32459792, The most popular tweets shared on Twitter were open-access resources, including links for updated literature, narrative reviews, and educational videos relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 clinical care.
32459792, Concurrent hashtags and words in tweets containing #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags spanned several different disciplines and topics in pediatric critical care.Twitter has been used widely for real-time information sharing and collaboration among the international pediatric critical care community during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
32459792, Targeted use of #PedsICU and #COVID19 for engagement on Twitter is a conduit to combat misinformation and optimize reach to pediatric critical care stakeholders across the globe when rapid dissemination is needed.
32459790, No patients died.On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old.
32459790, Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy.
32459790, Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission.
32459790, These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.
32459701, Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin.
32459701, Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure.
32459701, Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer.
32459701, Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated.One in five pregnant women who contracted COVID-19 infection developed moderate or severe disease, including a small proportion with prolonged critical illness who received ICU or step-down-level care.
32459675, First, they propose delaying the date that programs can access applicant data through the Electronic Residency Application Service, thereby affording students more time to complete clinical experiences, solidify their specialty decision, and strengthen their residency application.
32459675, Second, the authors recommend a restriction on the number of visiting rotations that students are expected to complete to allow for a more equitable distribution of these important experiences.
32459675, Third, they suggest that program directors from each specialty agree on a maximum number of applications per applicant (based on historical data) to curb an upsurge in applications that may stem from the unique circumstances created by COVID-19 without causing applicants undue stress.
32459675, Lastly, the authors advocate that residency programs develop infrastructure to conduct video-based interviews and engage students through virtual networking events.Amidst the unique environment created by COVID-19, the authors urge governing bodies, specialty organizations, and residency programs to consider these recommendations to improve the efficiency and reduce the stress surrounding the 2021 Match.
32459672, Elevated admission D-dimer and peak D-dimer were associated with venous thromboembolism development (p < 0.05).
32459672, D-dimer greater than 2,600 ng/mL predicted venous thromboembolism with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.760 (95% CI, 0.661-0.858; p < 0.0001), sensitivity of 89.7%, and specificity of 59.5%. Twelve patients (11%) had thromboelastography performed and 58% of these patients had a hypercoagulable study.
32459672, The calculated coagulation index was hypercoagulable in 50% of patients with thromboelastography.These data show that coronavirus disease 2019 results in a hypercoagulable state.
32459672, Routine chemical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis may be inadequate in preventing venous thromboembolism in severe coronavirus disease 2019.
32459655, The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for ICU and desired more time for it.
32459655, Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about using mobile phones for remote monitoring, and AI-based intelligent alarm management.This survey study among ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine.
32459655, Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm SOPs, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing digital literacy of ICU staff.
32459655, Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03514173; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03514173.
32459574, In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.
32459529, Evidence was conflicting and insufficient regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on such outcomes as all-cause mortality, progression to severe disease, clinical symptoms, and upper respiratory virologic clearance with antigen testing.
32459529, Several studies found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine developed a QTc interval of 500 ms or greater, but the proportion of patients with this finding varied among the studies.
32459529, Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation.
32459529, An observational study that compared adults with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine phosphate 500 mg once or twice daily with patients not receiving chloroquine found minor fever resolution and virologic clearance benefits with chloroquine.There were few controlled studies, and control for confounding was inadequate in observational studies.Evidence on the benefits and harms of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 is very weak and conflicting.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
32459192, In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
32459192, The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
32459192, This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.
32459192, Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.
32459123, Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace.
32459123, In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients.
32459123, In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state.
32459123, Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
32459003, However coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 can suppress host IFN-I anti-viral responses.
32459003, Retinoids are a family molecules related to vitamin A that possess robust immune modulating properties, including the ability to increase and potentiate the actions of IFN-I.
32459003, Therefore adjuvants such as retinoids, capable of increasing IFN-I mediated anti-viral responses should be tested in combinations of IFN-I and anti-viral drugs in pre-clinical studies of SARS-CoV-2.This article is protected by copyright.

32458599, Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32458599, Currently, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, two chloroquine derivatives, are under clinical use.
32458599, Although these two agents exhibit similar mechanisms of drug actions, there is a difference between these two chemicals in terms of target populations, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions.
32458599, This paper summarizes the currently available data and experiences from clinical treatment for malaria with chloroquine drugs, so as to provide insights into the more rational use of chloroquine agents for the treatment of COVID-19.
32458596, We have drafted Recommendations on Management of Gynecological Malignancies during the COVID-19 Pandemic based on our experience on controlling COVID-19 pandemic in China.
32458596, We recommend that patients with gynecological malignancies should be managed in hierarchical and individualized manners in combination with local conditions related to COVID-19.

32458356, Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression.
32458356, We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision.
32458356, This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.
32458356, We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
32458279, This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32458279, Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited.
32458279, We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.
32458279, Graphical abstract.
32458206, Using bromhexine at a dosage that selectively inhibits TMPRSS2 and, in so doing, inhibits TMPRSS2-specific viral entry is likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
32458206, We propose the use of bromhexine as a prophylactic and treatment.
32458206, We encourage the scientific community to assess bromhexine clinically as a prophylactic and curative treatment.
32458206, If proven to be effective, this would allow a rapid, accessible, and cost-effective application worldwide.
32458149, Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection.
32458149, Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs.
32458149, Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication.
32458149, Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.
32458125, Ninety-two percent of patients had respiratory symptoms, and 8% of them had digestive symptoms.
32458125, Fever (92%), cough (60%) and fatigue (56%) were the most common symptoms.
32458125, Most patients had a normal or reduced WBC (96%), reduced lymphocyte count (60%), increased CRP (48%) and increased ESR (44%).
32458125, Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the typical radiological finding on chest CT.Characteristic chest CT imaging features could appear earlier than the viral nucleic acid assay results.
32458121, They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.Two patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.
32458121, A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.
32458121, The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.
32458121, Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.
32458042, Touch Surgery is an application available on smartphones and tablets that gives the possibility to watch real and virtually designed surgical videos, accompanied by explanatory comments on the surgical phases; they are interactive and give the possibility to check what you have learned through tests administered after virtual classes.
32458042, In our opinion, these tools represent reliable solutions to improve plastic residents' training, mostly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

32457932, The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ.
32457932, Infusions of epinephrine titrated to treat unstable hypotension, as well as potassium for severe hypokalemia may be required.
32457932, Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease.
32457932, Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution.
32457924, Most patients had consolidations combined with ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest computed tomography scan.
32457924, Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia in 10 patients, high blood glucose in 11, GGT in 5 of the 14 patients, and high LDH in 5 of 6 patients tested.
32457924, In addition, this cohort had high level of cytokines such as interleukin-6 in all 8 patients tested.The clinical and laboratory parameters in the cohort of fatal cases may be incorporated into future clinical prognosis models and will be of help in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.© The Author(s) 2020.

32457038, This suggests NPC1 inhibitors or NP-C disease mimetics could serve as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.
32457038, Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in pre-clinical studies, without causing NP-C disease.
32457038, Inhibition of NPC1 may impair viral SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via several lipid-dependent mechanisms, which disturb the microenvironment optimum for viral infectivity.

32456506, There is also growing evidence of potentially useful clinical biomarkers to predict COVID-19 progression and disease outcomes.
32456506, Of those, a link between thrombocytopenia and COVID-19 severity or mortality was suggested.
32456506, In this opinion report, we examine the published evidence of hematological and hemostatic laboratory derangements in COVID-19 and the interrelated SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, with a focussed discussion on platelet count alterations.
32456506, We explore whether thrombocytopenia could be a potential disease biomarker and we provide recommendations for future studies in this regard.
32456489,To add to the growing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, so as to better inform clinical decision making and optimize patient outcomes.A systematic search of relevant databases was perfomed on 25 March 2020 and a repeat search, on 10 April 2020.
32456489, Reports of pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at any time during their pregnancy were reviewed and summarized .We summarized the outcomes of a total of 155 pregnant women and 118 neonates.
32456489, The evidence suggests a similar rate of severe COVID-19 cases in pregnant women and the general population.
32456489, The frequency of cesarean deliveries is high, against guidelines recommendations.Limited data on COVID-19 during preganacy, associated with a wide variation in the methodology make accurate data interpretation difficult.
32456461, This article seeks to establish an association between novel coronavirus sequelae and cancer.
32456461, A literature review on COVID-19 mechanisms of action, molecular responses it elicits upon infection and tumorigenesis pathways is conducted to establish this association. Major signaling pathways implicated in aberrant cellular growth are activated, the ensuing cytokine storm weakens the immune system response to tumors, and patients may develop cancer as a result of superimposed mutagenic and/or carcinogenic events.
32456461, Future work needs to be performed to support this hypothesis, both in in vitro models and preclinical studies.
32456461, COVID-19 patients may need to be monitored post-infection for developing cancer.
32456441, This is problematic for HPE, which has traditionally relied on face-to-face learner interaction, in the form of skills laboratories, simulation training and industry-based clinical placements.
32456441, The transition to online-only course delivery has brought with it a need to address particular issues regarding the construction and delivery of quality curricula and education activities.
32456441, It is in this context that regional, rural and remote health professionals and academics can provide invaluable insights into the use of technology to overcome the tyranny of distance, promote high-quality online HPE and enable the ongoing development of communities of practice.
32456441, This article is the first in a series addressing the risks and opportunities in the current transition to online HPE, providing practical solutions for educators who are now unable to embrace more traditional face-to-face HPE delivery methods and activities.
32456404, Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19.
32456404, The first group included phase I/II trials with different types of molecules (DNA or mRNA vaccine, bacterial plasmid or viral vectors), the latter were phase III/IV trials designed on the basis of a heterologous lymphocyte activation by the BCG vaccine.This new disease is pushing the scientific community to develop swiftly a safe and effective vaccine.
32456404, Notwithstanding the limitations of our analysis, given by the absence of available results, we try to provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing clinical trials in humans.
32456404, Our analysis reveals a worldwide effort of both scientists and enterprises to achieve one of the most challenging goals of our century.
32456286, A total of 100 μM of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV.
32456286, Interestingly, the combination of 100 μM of HCQ and 104 U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-ω (rfIFN-ω, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection.
32456286, Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-ω are applicable for treatment of FIP.
32456286, Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.
32456064, However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization.
32456064, Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal.
32456064, Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency.
32456064, Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.
32455961, Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise is a non-invasive, physical therapy, that has been suggested as part of the procedures involved with pulmonary rehabilitation, even in ICU settings.
32455961, Therefore, in the current review, the World Association of Vibration Exercise Experts (WAVEX) reviewed the potential of WBV exercise as a useful and safe intervention for the management of infected individuals with COVID-19 by mitigating the inactivity-related declines in physical condition and reducing the time in ICU.
32455961, Recommendations regarding the reduction of fatigue and the risk of dyspnea, the improvement of the inflammatory and redox status favoring cellular homeostasis and the overall improvement in the quality of life are provided.
32455961, Finally, practical applications for the use of this paradigm leading to a better prognosis in bed bound and ICU-bound subjects is proposed.
32455894,The recent novel coronavirus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has developed into an international pandemic affecting millions of individuals with hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.
32455894, The highly infectious nature and widespread prevalence of this disease create a new set of obstacles for the bladder cancer community in both delivering and receiving care.
32455894, In this manuscript, we address the unique issues regarding treatment prioritization for the patient with bladder cancer and how we at City of Hope have adjusted our clinical practices using a team-based approach that utilizes shared decision making with all stakeholders (physicians, patients, caregivers) to optimize outcomes during this difficult time.
32455894, In addition to taking standard precautions for minimizing COVID-19 risk of exposure for those entering a healthcare facility (screening all personnel upon entry and donning facemasks at all times), we suggest the following three measures: (1) delay post-treatment surveillance visits until there is a decrease in local COVID-19 cases, (2) continue curative intent treatments for localized bladder cancer with COVID-19 precautions (i.e., choosing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) over dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (ddMVAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and (3) increase the off-treatment period between cycles of palliative systemic therapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.
32455859, To date, despite no universal guidelines are available for dental procedures in pediatric dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak, routine dental practice should be postponed and only severe dental emergencies must be treated.
32455859, In the case of a dental emergency, involving a pediatric patient, dentists should be aware of which recommended management protocol can be adopted during the practice to protect patient health, to safeguard their-self and to prevent viral transmission.
32455859, The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol.
32455859, Pediatric dentists should keep a high level of awareness to help patients, minimize risk and prevent viral spread.
32455629, Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor.
32455629, Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
32455629, Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents.
32455629, In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
32455612, In conclusion, COVID-19 has had many immediate complications for dentistry of which some may have further long-term impacts on clinical practice, dental education and dental research.
32455539, We found that the receptor and transmembrane protease necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, were upregulated in smoking samples from both lung and oral epithelial tissue.
32455539, We then explored the mechanistic hypothesis that smoking may upregulate ACE2 expression through the upregulation of the androgen pathway.
32455539, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 upregulation were both correlated to androgen pathway enrichment and the specific upregulation of central pathway regulatory genes.
32455539, These data provide a potential model for the increased susceptibility of smoking patients to COVID-19 and encourage further exploration into the androgen and tobacco upregulation of ACE2 to understand the potential clinical ramifications.
32455515, Conclusions: The clinical course of COVID-19 can exacerbate rapidly from mild to critical with lung, liver and heart injuries.
32455515, Steadily increased inflammation indices are suggestive of irreversible disease progression and worse outcome.
32455515, In the early stages of the disease, the progress of the disease should be closely observed and evaluated, and the factors related to the progress of the disease should be identified and managed.
32455503, Results I address charges that my coauthors and I had misapplied the precautionary principle; drawn conclusions that were not supported by empirical research; and failed to take account of potential harms But before that, I remind my critics that the evidence on face coverings goes beyond the contested trials and observational studies they place centre stage.
32455503, I set out some key findings from basic science, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, case studies, and natural experiments, and use this rich and diverse body of evidence as the backdrop for my rebuttal of their narrowly framed objections.
32455503, I challenge my critics' apparent assumption that a particular kind of systematic review should be valorised over narrative and real-world evidence, since stories are crucial to both our scientific understanding and our moral imagination.
32455503, Conclusion I conclude by thanking my academic adversaries for the intellectual sparring match, but exhort them to remember our professional accountability to a society in crisis.

32455168, Allocation of these resources to those most likely to benefit can be supported by clinical prediction models.
32455168, The ethical and practical considerations relevant to predictions supporting decisions about microallocation are distinct from those that inform shared decision-making in ways important for model design.We review three issues of importance for microallocation: (1) Prediction of benefit (or of medical futility) may be technically very challenging; (2) When resources are scarce, calibration is less important for microallocation than is ranking to prioritize patients, since capacity determines thresholds for resource utilization; (3) The concept of group fairness, which is not germane in shared decision-making, is of central importance in microallocation.
32455168, Therefore, model transparency is important.Prediction supporting allocation of life-saving interventions should be explicit, data-driven, frequently updated and open to public scrutiny.
32455168, This implies a preference for simple, easily understood and easily applied prognostic models.© The Author(s) 2020.
32455147, The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was utilized to analyze the prognostic ability of C-reactive protein (CRP).About 7.7% (16/209) of nonsevere adult COVID-19 patients progressed to severe cases after admission.
32455147, Compared with nonsevere patients, the aggravated patients had much higher levels of CRP (median [range], 43.8 [12.3-101.9] mg/L vs 12.1 [0.1-91.4] mg/L; P = .000).
32455147, A regression analysis showed that CRP was significantly associated with aggravation of nonsevere COVID-19 patients, with an area under the curve of 0.844 (95% confidence interval, 0.761-0.926) and an optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L.CRP could be a valuable marker to anticipate the possibility of aggravation of nonsevere adult COVID-19 patients, with an optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L.© The Author(s) 2020.

32455090, A dermatopathological biopsy suggested a bullous drug reaction with an erythema multiform-like reaction pattern versus SJS/TEN.
32455090, Moreover, the internal COVID-19 test returned positive.
32455090, The delayed positive test results and complicated hospital course with our patient required us to scale back and notify every patient and staff member whom they came in contact with, across multiple institutions.
32455090, We suggest that whenever a suspected COVID-19 patient is transferred to a specialized center, they should be isolated and re-checked before joining the new patient population for treatment of the unique condition.Copyright © 2020, Lagziel et al.
32454891, Fortunately, mental health services and psychology professional bodies across the United Kingdom have issued guidance to meet these needs.
32454891, An attempt has been made to translate these sets of guidance into clinical provisions via the recently established Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway delivered by Talk Changes (Hackney & City IAPT).
32454891, This article describes the phased, stepped-care and evidence-based approach that has been adopted by the service to support local frontline NHS staff.
32454891, We wish to share our service design and pathway of care with other Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services who may also seek to support hospital frontline staff within their associated NHS Trusts and in doing so, lay the foundations of a coordinated response.(1)To understand the ways staff can be psychologically and emotionally impacted by working on the frontline of disease outbreaks.(2)To understand the ways in which IAPT services have previously supported populations exposed to crises.(3)To learn ways of delivering psychological support and interventions during a pandemic context based on existing guidance and research.© British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies 2020.
32454888, The results suggested that QBD has multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, antiviral, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antipyretic and so on.

32454807, Minor, non-specific changes in biochemical variables were reported.
32454807, Studies that tested breast milk reported negative SARS-CoV-2 results.Given the paucity of studies at this time, vertical transmission cannot be confirmed or denied.
32454807, Current literature does not support abstaining from breastfeeding nor separating mothers and newborns.
32454807, Further evidence and data collection networks, particularly in the Americas, are needed for establishing definitive guidelines and recommendations.
32454513, Surprisingly, neither the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBDs, although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric Spike proteins was found.
32454513, Crystal structure analysis of RBD-bound antibody revealed steric hindrance that inhibits viral engagement with ACE2 and thereby blocks viral entry.
32454513, These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are viral species-specific inhibitors.
32454513, The antibodies identified here may be candidates for the development of SARS-CoV-2 clinical interventions.
32454512, CA1 and CB6 demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.
32454512, In addition, CB6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus monkeys at both prophylactic and treatment settings.
32454512, Further structural studies revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct interface-residue competition.
32454512, Our results suggest CB6 deserves further clinical translation.
32454253, There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches.
32454253, Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.
32454253, Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.Copyright © 2020.

32453889, A recent theoretical study suggested a direct interaction between COVID-19 viral proteins and haemoglobin (Hb) that could lead to a loss of oxygen carrying capacity.
32453889, As national guidelines strongly support a restrictive transfusion strategy in the critically ill, any right-shift in the Hb O2 affinity curve could contribute to the hypoxaemia and be potentially harmful.
32453889, We have measured Hb O2 affinity curves from severely ill COVID-19 patients and, in comparison to age- and sex-matched controls, find no evidence for a shift in O2 affinity that would support any change in clinical management.This article is protected by copyright.

32453702, The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients.Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a "shut down" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro®. The ClotPro® parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation.These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy.
32453702, Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy.
32453702, At present, the authorization of a clinical trial that attempts to answer these questions is in progress.

32453196, Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia.
32453196, Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger.
32453196, Other viruses were associated with hypoxia more frequently than cases with HCoV; high fever was more common in influenza infections and bronchiolitis in respiratory syncytial virus group.
32453196, Although a slight peak of circulation appears mostly in winter, HCoV has been detected throughout the year as well.HCoV infections represent a small fraction of respiratory infections that require hospitalization in children and their characteristics do not differ greatly from other respiratory viral infections.
32452879, As patients transfer to sub-acute care or discharged to the community, rehabilitation services need to have a number of organizational and operational models in place to provide safe effective care for patients and health professionals.There is need for global action by professional organizations in developing a structured rehabilitation approach for international response to disasters, including pandemics.
32452879, This report proposes development of a 'Rehabilitation Response Plan' to enable the International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, to provide crucial leadership and governance role in liaison and coordination with the WHO (and other stakeholders), to provide rehabilitation input during current and future pandemics.
32452879, The key considerations include following categories: Governance, Coordination, Communication, Evaluation, and Care-continuum.
32452879, These will strengthen rehabilitation, assist in the effective delivery of services, provide advocacy, and an international coordinated perspective.

32452838, These students have collaborated with colleagues in other disciplines to provide necessary legal guidance to community members fearful of seeking care because of their immigration status.
32452838, The authors urge other academic institutions across the country to recruit multidisciplinary teams of medical, health professional, and law students invested in their local communities and to empower students to partner with CBOs, immigrant community leaders, faith-based organizations, hospitals, and local authorities to support these vulnerable communities during this crisis.
32452739, Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (P < .05).
32452739, Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread.Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 μm under surgical conditions.
32452739, During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing.
32452739, Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.
32452731, CONCLUSION.
32452731, On CT, the significant differences between influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia were findings of linear opacification, crazy-paving sign, vascular enlargement, pleural thickening, and pleural effusion, which were more common in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and bronchiectasis and pleural effusion, which were more common in patients with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia.
32452731, Other imaging findings, including peripheral or peribronchovascular distribution, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, subpleural line, air bronchogram, and bronchial distortion, were not significantly different between the two patient groups.
32452644, In agreement with this model, available epidemiological data show that the disease in males has an higher risk to display an heavier pattern and associates with both an increased access to critical care unit and higher mortality rate.
32452644, In this opinion article, available evidence linking the androgen activity with the gender differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed, hypothesizing possible therapeutic approaches in male based on the disruption of androgen signaling.
32452644, On these bases, gender-specific recommendations for the management of male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection are warmly suggested, in order to improve the clinical course of the disease.This article is protected by copyright.

32451351, We agree with the authors that, despite conflicting clinical data to date, it is possible that HCQ may have a protective effect in the setting of COVID-19.
32451351, More importantly, we agree that optimal HCQ dosage and timing is a critical underpinning for clinical trials.
32451351, However, we highlight several considerations regarding treatment with high dose HCQ.
32451271, A large percent of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease, and they are at a high risk of developing cardiac complications.
32451271, The basics of the virus, the clinical manifestations, and the possible mechanisms of cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 are reviewed.

32451162, The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers.Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer.
32451162, Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting.
32451162, Also, clinicians should value the importance of self-protection and mental health care.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32450906, The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men.The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China.
32450906, We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging.
32450906, Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies.The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.
32450906, The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.
32450732, Clinicians are starting to prepare for a transition from limited evaluation of emergent and urgent complaints to resumption of elective surgical procedures and routine office visits within the next few weeks to months.
32450732, Otolaryngology as a specialty faces unique challenges when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic due to the fact that a comprehensive head and neck examination requires aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures.
32450732, Since the COVID-19 pandemic is far from being over and the future may hold other highly communicable infectious threats that may require similar precautions, standard approaches to the clinical evaluation of common otolaryngology complaints will have to be modified.
32450732, In this communication, we present practical recommendations for dysphagia evaluation with modifications to allow a safe and comprehensive assessment.
32450727,The chest CT findings that can distinguish patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from those with clinically suspected COVID-19 but subsequently found to be COVID-19 negative have not previously been described in detail.
32450727, The purpose of this study was to determine the distinctions among patients with COVID-19 by comparing the imaging findings of patients with suspected confirmed COVID-19 and those of patients initially suspected to haveCOVID-19 who were ultimately negative for the disease.28 isolated suspected in-patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 22, 2020, to February 6, 2020. 12 patients were confirmed to have positive severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA results, and 16 patients had negative results.
32450727, The thin-section CT imaging findings and clinical and laboratory data of all the patients were evaluated.There were no significant differences between the 12 confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2-positive) patients and 16 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients in epidemiology and most of the clinical features or laboratory data.
32450727, The CT images showed that the incidence of pure/mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) was not different between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients [9/12 (75.0%) vs 10/16 (62.5%), p = 0.687], but pure/mixed GGOs in the peripheral were more common in patients with COVID-19 [11/12 (91.7%) vs 6/16 (37.5%), p = 0.006]. There were no significant differences in the number of lesions, bilateral lung involvement, large irregular/patchy opacities, rounded opacities, linear opacities, crazy-paving patterns, halo signs, interlobular septal thickening or air bronchograms.Although peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on CT may help distinguish patients with COVID-19 from clinically suspected but negative patients, CT cannot replace RT-PCR testing.Peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on-chest CT findings can be helpful in distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from those with clinically suspected COVID-19 but subsequently found to be COVID-19 negative.
32450718, However, more attention should be paid with respect to the risk of viral diffusion among asymptomatic people.
32450718, Italy is the second most involved country in the world, and we needed to gain a lot of experience in a very limited time.
32450718, At least 1 m of distance among people is recommended; however, some clinical practices cannot allow this distance.
32450718, In this context, we believe that the careful safety assessment of clinical settings, like ophthalmologic ones, may have a remarkable impact on the fight against SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32450565, Common complications include acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmia, pericarditis, heart failure, and shock.
32450565, We present a case of cor pulmonale diagnosed with serial point of care ultrasound.
32450565, Given the current shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and high infectivity of this virus, we acknowledge the utility of this tool in obtaining important clinical information while minimizing exposure and PPE consumption.© 2020 S.

32450416, To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students.
32450416, While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths.
32450416, However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32450344, Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.
32450344, The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes' function and platelet adhesion.

32450314, Patient screening at teleclinics identified 11 urgent surgical cases.
32450314, The implementation of the 'Battle Plan' led to a significant decrease in the case load, and the variation of cases by subspecialty is evident when compared to a control group comprised of 214 patients.Delivery of optimal care and safe practice and education at an academic neurosurgical department can be well maintained with proper execution of crisis protocols.

32450198, One or sum of diverse mechanisms might work against the viral infections and help prevent more deaths.
32450198, Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.
32450198, There is still a need to find other innovative drug candidates as other possible candidate to go into clinical evaluation and testing.Copyright © 2020.

32450197, Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2.
32450197, Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens.
32450197, Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32449782, Pooled analysis revealed that common complications up to 6 months were: impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (prevalence 27%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15-45%); and reduced exercise capacity ((mean 6-min walking distance 461 m, CI 450-473 m).
32449782, The prevalences of post-traumatic stress disorder (39%, 95% CI 31-47%), depression (33%, 95% CI 20-50%) and anxiety (30%, 95% CI 10-61) beyond 6 months were considerable.
32449782, Low scores on Short-Form 36 were identified at 6 months and beyond.Lung function abnormalities, psychological impairment and reduced exercise capacity were common in SARS and MERS survivors.
32449782, Clinicians should anticipate and investigate similar long-term outcomes in COVID-19 survivors.
32449781, The high-est rating of itch for the whole group on the Itch Numeral Rating Scale was 4.07 ± 2.06 (itch of moderate intensity).
32449781, Responders who wore masks for longer periods more frequently reported itch.
32449781, Almost 30% of itchy subjects reported scratching their face without removing the mask, or after removing the mask and then scratching.
32449781, Wearing face masks is linked to development of itch, and scratching can lead to incorrect use of face masks, resulting in reduced protection.
32449766, We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms.Text analytics revealed that concepts such as "smell" and "taste" were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive.
32449766, As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms.
32449766, The deep learning model yielded an AUC of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling.Informatics tools such as NLP and AI methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response.© The Author(s) 2020.

32449614, Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators.
32449614, The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.
32449614, Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes.
32449614, Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.

32449523, In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems- and policy-level requirements that are needed.
32449523, We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions.
32449523, We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system.
32449523, Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32449329, The viral load was the highest in the nasopharynx (patient 1 = 8.41 log10 copies/mL; patient 2 = 7.49 log10 copies/mL), but it was also remarkably high in the saliva (patient 1 = 6.63 log10 copies/mL; patient 2 = 7.10 log10 copies/mL).
32449329, SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to hospital day 6 (illness day 9 for patient 2) from the saliva of both patients.
32449329, The viral load in the saliva decreased transiently for 2 hours after using the chlorhexidine mouthwash.SARS-CoV-2 viral load was consistently high in the saliva; it was relatively higher than that in the oropharynx during the early stage of COVID-19.
32449329, Chlorhexidine mouthwash was effective in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the saliva for a short-term period.© 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.
32449235, The interaction between immunosuppression and new antiviral drugs in the treatment of transplanted patients contracting COVID-19 has not yet been fully investigated.

32449178, According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES=0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES=0.22 and 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES=0.19), negative affectivity (ES = 0.96) and less positive affectivity (ES=0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort.
32449178, Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms [OR=1.94, χ2(1)=10.05, p=.002]. Multiple regression analyses indicated that COVID-19 pregnant women having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms.
32449178, Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.This article is protected by copyright.

32449100, At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms.
32449100, Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation.
32449100, Two patients expired during the admission.Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases.
32449100, The prevalence of disease in the population may be underestimated by the current paradigm of RT-PCR testing with the current clinical criteria of lower respiratory symptoms and exposure risk.
32449057, Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified.
32449057, Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients' with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology.
32449057, The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease.
32449057, The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.
32449043, A total of 23,580 outpatients (93.8%) were cancelled.
32449043, Emergency room consultations declined by 68.14% and 63.47% among white and green priority, respectively, while increased by 25% and 100% among yellow and red, respectively.These numbers show the radical changed scenario in an orthopaedic center in Milan during COVID-19 pandemic.
32449043, Elective surgery declined rapidly going close to zero, outpatient admissions were restricted to cases that cannot be postponed, while emergencies increased due to the role played by the hospital as referral orthopaedic centre during the pandemic.
32449043, The still ongoing emergency will have important impacts on the overall orthopaedic healthcare management for the next months.
32448818, Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus.
32448818, The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied.
32448818, These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations.
32448818, Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

32448345, The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital.
32448345, One interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once half of the total number of events required has been observed.This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19.
32448345, Enrolment began in sites in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 6th February 2020.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04257656.
32448345, Registered on 6 February 2020.
32448333, Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers.This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy.
32448333, Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay.
32448333, Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery.
32448333, A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations.
32448085, Among them, 24 best-scored ligands (14 traditional herbal isolate and 10 approved drugs) with the binding energy below -8.1 kcal/mol were selected as potential candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, preventing the human cell infection and their replication.
32448085, For instance, the ivermectin drug (present in our list of promise candidates) was recently used successful to control viral replication in vitro.
32448085, MD simulations were performed for the three best ligands@S-protein complexes and the binding energies were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach.
32448085, Overall, it is highlighted an important strategy, some key residues, and chemical groups which may be considered on clinical trials for COVID-19 outbreak.
32448084, Results showed that none of 8 primer/probe sets used in qRT-PCR could significantly distinguish true negatives and positives with low viral load (10-4 dilution).
32448084, Moreover, false positive reports of qRT-PCR with UCDC-N1, N2 and CCDC-N primers/probes sets were observed.
32448084, In contrast, ddPCR showed significantly better performance in general for low viral load samples compared to qRT-PCR.
32448084, Remarkably, the background readouts of ddPCR are relatively lower, which could efficiently reduce the production of false positive reports.
32448041, Several published studies have shown an association between Covid-19 illness and secondary bacterial infection.
32448041, However, the proposed mechanism by which a virus can develop a secondary bacterial infection is not well delineated.
32448041, The aim of this commentary is to update the current evidence of the risk of bacterial infection in patients with Covid-19.
32448041, We present several clinical studies related to the topic as well as a brief review of the potential pathophysiology of secondary infections that could present with Covid-19.
32447934, Conclusions: Coagulation parameters should be monitored closely in critical COVID-2019 patients.
32447934, The timing and protocol of anticoagulation therapy are still under investigation based on more clinical data.
32447904, Conclusion: The infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases is high, and isolation medical observation measures should be implemented in strict accordance with the close contact management plan.
32447846, Additionally, we analyzed the intervention scheme of acupuncture for COVID-19 developed by China Association of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and supplemented the protocol of the intervention with auricular acupuncture.
32447846, It was proposed that the advantages of acupuncture and moxibustion should be fully displayed while Chinese herbal medications have been applied in the treatment of COVID-19.
32447846, During treatment, acupuncture physicians should be rationally allocated to a certain proportion so as to adequately utilize comprehensive therapeutic approaches and guarantee people's safety to the greatest extent.
32447846, Eventually, the clinical therapeutic effect may be improved, the national resources be economized on and the COVID-19 epidemic be conquered early.
32447801, We are here by suggesting that the clinical presentation of HZ at the time of the current pandemic even in patients giving mild or no suggestive history of upper respiratory symptoms should be considered as an alarming sign for a recent subclinical SARS CoV2 infection.

32447746, Such central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms linked to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is often life threatening.
32447746, Health care providers currently evaluating patients with neurologic symptoms need consider COVID-19 in any differential diagnosis.
32447746, These considerations will facilitate prompt testing, isolation and prevention of viral transmission speeding best clinical outcomes.
32447746, Graphical Abstract.
32447742, It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32447742, Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32447742, Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
32447742, Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32447429, There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies.
32447429, Following the spike in public interest, the average number of new trials increased tenfold with respect to antimalarial therapies.The relatively small sample sizes and the number of independent trials investigating similar therapies are concerning.
32447429, Resources may not be being allocated based on scientific merit and may be driven by public consciousness and speculation.
32447429, Moving forward, a concerted effort focused on implementing large, well-coordinated and carefully designed multi-armed clinical trials will help to ensure that the most promising therapeutic options are rigorously studied and clinically meaningful results produced.
32447328, Conclusions This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2.
32447328, The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.
32447274, Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied and highly satisfied.Seventeen out of twenty teleconsultations were successfully completed (85%).
32447274, Failures were due to patients not responding (2/20) and technical issues (1/20).
32447274, Rates of patients declaring themselves satisfied or highy satisfied were 17/17 for technical quality, 15/17 for convenience and 16/17 for overall quality of care.Planned real-time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet is feasibile and highly appreciated in patients with MS.
32447274, Incorporation of such services in routine clinical MS practice is expected to improve access to specialized care facilities for affected subjects.
32447256, The rate of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4% (6/431); all patients with co-infection had mild disease and stayed in communal settings.
32447256, The in-hospital mortality rate and proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation was low, at around 1% of patients; these rates were lower than patients with other community-acquired respiratory viruses admitted over the same period (p < 0.01).Even amidst an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, common respiratory viruses still accounted for a substantial proportion of hospitalizations.

32447102, Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P<0.07) of its effects.
32447102, Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
32447102, These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.Copyright © 2020.

32446795, Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes.
32446795, COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%).
32446795, Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality due to COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32446312, The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74).
32446312, However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01).
32446312, Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin.
32446312, This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.

32445484,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated COVID-19 disease are straining healthcare systems around the world with large numbers of patients becoming ill in a very short period of time, overwhelming healthcare systems in many countries.
32445484, Several drugs are being repurposed into clinical trials in COVID-19 patients, ranging from drugs already well established in other diseases, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ ritonavir, azithromycin and tocilizumab/sarilumab, to those such as remdesivir still in development for their initial indication (1).
32445484, The opportunities for clinical pharmacology to contribute to the development of new treatments have already been described by others in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2).This article is protected by copyright.

32445440, The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group.
32445440, Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P<0.001).
32445440, The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04).
32445440, Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

32445315, Penile cancers should undergo penectomy, while clinically negative groins can be kept on surveillance.
32445315, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided and adjuvant therapy should be deferred.
32445315, We need to tailor our treatment strategies to the prevailing present conditions, so as to fight and defeat both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer.
32445315, Protection of health care workers, judicious use of available resources, and a rational and balanced outlook towards different malignancies is the need of the hour.
32445249, SARS CoV-1 and 2 share almost 80% of genetic sequences and use the same host cell receptor to initiate viral infection.
32445249, However, SARS predominantly affected individuals in close contact with infected animals and health care workers.
32445249, In contrast, CoV-2 exhibits robust person to person spread, most likely by means of asymptomatic carriers, which has resulted in greater spread of disease, overall morbidity and mortality, despite its lesser virulence.

32445165, We consider two different clinical settings, where availability of the different diagnostic strategies differs widely: outpatient and inpatient.
32445165, Our reasoning highlights how challenging a balanced approach to a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms can be.
32445165, At present, clinical workup of COVID-19 remains a hard task to accomplish.
32445165, However, knowledge of the natural history of the disease may aid the internist in putting common and unspecific symptoms into the correct clinical context.
32445105, Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate.
32445105, The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period.
32445105, Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay.In a one-month period (3/27/20-4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites.This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic.
32445105, The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.

32444743, These vital traits and bold clinical leadership, prepared to make timely choices and act fast, will underpin our successful transition towards the safe resumption of routine dental services.
32444743, In making the right choices, we have at hand a future integrated dental team care model with time to concentrate on personalised prevention advice, as well as the provision of effective, highly skilled treatment.
32444569, Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, before delivery, allows their management through dedicated protocols and minimizes the risk of contagion for other patients and healthcare providers.
32444569, Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded at present, and should be ruled out as soon as possible after birth.
32444569, Rooming in of infected mothers and neonates, provided their good clinical conditions, is not contraindicated based on current knowledge.

32444382, In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model.
32444382, While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi.
32444382, Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection.
32444382, As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.Copyright © 2020 Park et al.

32443899, Age; increased respiratory rate; abnormal blood gas parameters and imaging findings; coexisting coronary heart disease; leukocytosis; lymphocytopenia; and several laboratory parameters (elevated procalcitonin; interleukin-6; serum ferritin; C-reactive protein; aspartate aminotransferase; lactate dehydrogenase; creatinine; fibrinogen; troponin-I; and D-dimer) were significant predictors of clinical deterioration.
32443899, We suggested a prognostic index to assist risk-stratification (C-statistic; 0.845; 95% CI; 0.802‒0.887).
32443899, These results could aid early identification and management of patients at risk, who should therefore receive additional monitoring and aggressive supportive care.
32443712, Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used for recruiting participants.
32443712, We utilized the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire.
32443712, A higher percentage of participants knew about "Clinical and pathogen characteristics of COVID-19", compared to "Regulations and policies related to COVID-19". The percentage of participants accessing the information on "Guidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19" was the lowest, especially among medical students. "Mass media and peer-educators" channels had a higher score of accessing COVID-19 information, compared to "Organizations/ agencies/ associations" sources.
32443712, Participants consumed most of their COVID-19 information via "Internet, online newspapers, social networks". Our findings indicate an urgency to re-design training programs and communication activities for a more effective dissemination of information related to the COVID-19 epidemic or epidemics in general.
32443459, To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results.
32443459, Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32443459, Based on ten studies, we computed a pooled sensitivity of 64.8% (95%CI 54.5-74.0), and specificity of 98.0% (95%CI 95.8-99.0), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias.
32443459, We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.
32443442, Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts.
32443442, The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients.
32443442, Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean ± standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.1, 0.86 ± 0.16 and 0.80 ± 0.1 and a receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.79 ± 0.1.
32443442, The need for ICU treatment is independently associated with affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP, and IL-6.
32443163,The pharmacological and immunological properties of interferons, especially those of interferon beta, and the corresponding treatment strategies are described, and the results of studies with different interferons in coronavirus infections are analysed.
32443163, Furthermore, the data obtained with high-dosed native interferon beta in life-threatening acute viral diseases as well as the results of clinical pilot studies with high-dosed recombinant interferon beta-1a are provided because they serve as the rationale for the proposed therapeutic regimen to be applied in acute viral infections.
32443163, This regimen differs from those approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and consists of interferon beta-1a administered as a 24 hour intravenous infusion at a daily dose of up to 90 µg for 3-5 consecutive days.
32443163, Since under this regimen transient severe side effects can occur, it is analysed which patients are suitable for this kind of treatment in general and if patients with severe coronavirus infections could also be treated accordingly.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32442932, One patient out of 26 died.
32442932, The population of our study was young and almost all were imported cases, in alinement with the stage of the epidemic at the time when the study was conducted.
32442932, We observed that there were two patterns in the fever curve but the persistence of it did not lead to a worse prognosis.
32442932, Larger population studies are required in order to confirm these clinical findings.
32442756, The area under receiving operating curve (AUROC) reached 0.9996 and 0.9757 in the training and testing dataset, respectively.
32442756, When the using cut-off value as 0.0667, the recall rate was 93.33 % and 100 % in the training and testing datasets, separately.
32442756, Cox multivariate regression and survival analyses revealed that the model significantly discriminated the severe/critical cases and used the information of the selected clinical indicators.The model was robust and effective in predicting the severe/critical COVID cases.Copyright © 2020.

32442528, As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.
32442528, The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6).
32442528, In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32442437, However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment.
32442437, Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development.
32442437, According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32442333, Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in all provinces across China.
32442333, In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID-19 incubation period.
32442333, Moreover, if the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%.Although the risk is low, with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 and the appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and a high fatality rate, appropriate measures should be taken by health departments to ensure the safety of clinical blood.© 2020 The Authors.

32442285, In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (p<0.001).
32442285, However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; p=0.60).
32442285, No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.Our findings suggest that prior use of RAAS inhibitors was not independently associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in Korea.© The Author(s) 2020.

32442210, Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat.
32442210, The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
32442210, There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
32442210, Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32442082, For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails.
32442082, Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research.
32442082, At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders.
32442082, However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
32442035, A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
32442035, Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
32442035, Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
32442035, Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.World Health Organization.
32442030, CONCLUSION.
32442030, The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.
32441935, The analytical sensitivity of the RT-RAA assay was 10 copies for the S and one copy for the orf1ab gene per reaction.
32441935, Cross-reactions were not observed with any of the other respiratory pathogens.
32441935, A hundred percent agreement between the RT-RAA and real-time PCR assays was accomplished after testing 120 respiratory specimens.
32441935, These results demonstrate that the proposed RT-RAA assay will be beneficial as it is a faster, more sensitive, and more specific tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
32441805, In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury.
32441805, In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange.
32441805, Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab).
32441805, In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.© 2020, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

32441666, Conclusions Dynamic changes in vital hematological parameters from severe and non-severe patients had been characterized in the course of hospitalization.
32441666, During hospitalization, NLR was found to have certain relevance to the hospitalization days and a role in forecasting disease prognosis for patients with COVID-19.
32441574, Only three out of eight patients had pneumonia manifestation on radiography.
32441574, Most patients had a normal white blood cell (WBC) count and normal or reduced lymphocyte (LY) count.
32441574, Pneumonia changes were observed in all the four patients who underwent a chest CT scan.
32441574, Only one elderly patient developed severe pneumonia, while all the rest were mild disease and had a self-limiting course.
32441462,The global response to finding therapeutics for COVID-19 is chaotic even if well intentioned.
32441462, There is an opportunity, but more importantly, an obligation for the global clinical and quantitative pharmacology community to come together and use our state-of-the-art tools and expertise to help society accelerate therapeutics to fight COVID-19.

32441299, Using well-defined computational methods, we identified Glecaprevir and Maraviroc as the best inhibitors CoV-2 Mpro.
32441299, Both drugs bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and form a significant number of non-covalent interactions.
32441299, Glecaprevir and Maraviroc bind to the conserved substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32441299, This work provides sufficient evidence for the use of Glecaprevir and Maraviroc for the therapeutic management of COVID-19.Copyright 2020 The Author(s).
32441229, With little warning, clinical rotations were cancelled and medical students were sent home.
32441229, While pre-clinical students transitioned to online curricula, clinical students were left without discreet educational goals.
32441229, Simultaneously, medical doctors were scrambling to maintain competence in the face of rapidly evolving COVID-19 information.
32441229, Here, we describe an education program that integrates medical students into interdisciplinary teams to review emerging COVID-19 research that directly answers questions sent in by medical doctors.
32440906, From recent clinical observation, two phenotypes have emerged: a low elastance or L-type and a high elastance or H-type.
32440906, Clinical presentation, pathophysiology, pulmonary mechanics, radiological and ultrasound findings of these two phenotypes are different.
32440906, Consequently, the therapeutic approach also varies between the two.
32440906, We propose a management algorithm that combines the respiratory rate and oxygenation index with bedside lung ultrasound examination and monitoring that could help determine earlier the requirement for intubation and other surveillance of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.
32440887, EPICENTRE is open to centers all over the world, and this will allow to provide a pragmatic picture of the epidemic, with a particular attention to pediatric and neonatal critical care issues.Conclusions: EPICENTRE will allow researchers to clarify the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, refining its clinical management and hopefully providing new insights for clinicians.What is Known:• COVID19 is the new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is spreading around the globe.• Majority of data available about SARS-CoV-2 infections originates from adult patients.What is New:• EPICENTRE is the first international, multicenter, multidisciplinary, meta-data driven, hospital-based, online, prospective cohort registry dedicated to neonatal and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections.• EPICENTRE will allow to understand epidemiology and physiopathology of COVID19.
32440857, Patient 2 was a 75-year-old woman with a history of schistosomiasis-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites.
32440857, Her family members requested that invasive rescue measures not be undertaken, and she died of acute respiratory distress syndrome 40 days after presenting with COVID-19 infection.
32440857, Patient 3 was an 87-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and esophageal variceal hemorrhage.
32440857, He was discharged from the hospital 29 days after illness onset.The case series raise the possibility that decompensated cirrhosis may be a risk factor for a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.
32440661, According to the included articles, two children had died, one of which was a 14-year-old boy and his exposure history and underlying disease were unclear, and the other was a male newborn with gestational age of 35 weeks and 5 days, birth weight of 2200, Apgar score of 8, 8 (1 min and 5 min) and his first symptom was increased heart rate.
32440661, No differences were found between male and female children regarding infection with COVID-19.Most pediatrics were infected with COVID-19 due to family cluster or history of close contact.
32440661, Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared to infected adults.
32440661, We should pay special attention to early diagnosis and early treatment in children infected with COVID-19.
32440660, No case of maternal death was reported up to the time the studies were published. 79 mothers delivered their babies by cesarean section and five women had a vaginal delivery.
32440660, No fetal infection through intrauterine vertical transmission was reported.Available data showed that pregnant patients in late pregnancy had clinical manifestations similar to non-pregnant adults.
32440660, It appears that the risk of fetal distress, preterm delivery and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) rises with the onset of COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy.
32440660, There is also no evidence of intrauterine and transplacental transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancies.
32440387, We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1.
32440387, The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2.
32440387, The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can "break" laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature.
32440387, We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.Copyright © 2020, Sibert et al.
32439821, Other causes of myoclonus were ruled-out, and none of them had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia.
32439821, All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy.Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a postinfectious/immune-mediated disorder.
32439821, However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb.

32439209, The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse.
32439209, IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality.
32439209, In a binary logistic regression model, C-reactive protein level (OR 1.073, [CI, 1.013-1.136]; p = 0.017), CD8 T lymphocyte counts (OR 0.989, [CI, 0.979-1.000]; p = 0.043), and D-dimer (OR 5.313, [CI, 0.325-86.816]; p = 0.241) were independent predictors of disease severity.Copyright © 2020.

32439197, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock, and multiorgan failure have precipitated death.
32439197, Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients.
32439197, This paper aims to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID-19, encapsulating its multiorgan impact.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32438945, Diagnostic challenges, the effect of phone consultation on the therapeutic alliance, challenges associated with the use of technology and ethical concerns were identified as issues.
32438945, Flexibility in the working day and convenience were identified as possible benefits to telephone consultations.The group who participated in this research study identified a number of challenges to carrying out successful phone consultations.
32438945, This study highlights the need at our clinical site for interventions to address the issues identified by staff.
32438945, The findings also highlight the requirement for larger studies with stronger methodologies to determine the generalisability of our results.
32438941, The Central Clinical Committee analyzed that these re-positive cases after the COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the 'dead virus' remaining in the cured patients' body is amplified during the test process.
32438941, Comprehending the above evidence, re-positive casescase of COVID-19 isare not infectious; the virus is not even reactivated.
32438941, However, further research is required as we lack research results on this subject.
32438941, Until we can be sure, social distancing and other such policies should be maintained.
32438895, Younger age was found in stroke admissions during the pandemic (median [interquartile range] 69 [64-73] versus 75 [73-80] years, P=0.009).
32438895, In-hospital, there were no differences in workflow metrics, angiographic results, complications, or outcomes at discharge.The COVID-19 pandemic reduced by a quarter the stroke admissions and thrombectomies performed at a Comprehensive Stroke Center but did not affect the quality of care metrics.
32438895, During the lockdown, there was an overload of emergency calls but fewer Stroke Code activations, particularly in elderly patients.
32438895, Hospital contingency plans, patient transport systems, and population-targeted alerts must act concertedly to better protect the chain of stroke care in times of pandemic.
32438878, Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home.
32438878, At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in 'quarantine' for contact considered to be 'at risk' for the infection.
32438878, Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms.
32438878, This study represents the first observational detailed report about short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient organisation and management in a high-volume IBD centre.
32438876, With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT.
32438876, Consolidation performance accounts for 0% in 1- 2 days, 40% in 3- 6 days, and 71% in 7- 10 days.
32438876, The lesions are mostly near the pleura.
32438876, The number of lesions and the extent of the lesions increased as the disease progressed.Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia have characteristic CT features in the initial stage of infection, which can be used as an essential supplement for nucleic acid examination.
32438868, According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR reports were detected as positive by ddPCR.
32438868, The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively.
32438868, Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR, which still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 5-12 days post discharge.
32438868, Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.
32438806, The clinical performance of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 181 clinical samples.
32438806, Among them, 14 qRT-PCR-negative samples (7 had no repetitive results, and 7 had no Ct values) were detected by OSN-qRT-PCR.
32438806, Moreover, the 7qRT-PCR-positives in the qRT-PCR grey zone (Ct value of ORF1ab ranged from 37.48 to 39.07, and Ct value of N ranged from 37.34 to 38.75) were out of the grey zone thus were deemed to be positive by OSN-qRT-PCR, indicating the positivity of these samples is confirmative.
32438806, Compared to the qRT-PCR kit, OSN-qRT-PCR assay revealed higher sensitivity and specificity hence better suited to clinical applications for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral load.
32438703, As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation.
32438703, Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy.
32438703, Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment.
32438703, The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.
32438579, Compared to the former two, the starters (cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed longer symptom-onset to diagnosis (p = 0.02); longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation (p = 0.01); higher first-generation reproduction number (p = 0.03); and more critical presentation (endotracheal tube insertion and intensive care unit (ICU) care) (p < 0.01).
32438579, In addition, compared to the former two, the starters of the latter were older, had no history of travel, and had more underlying diseases and more mortality.
32438579, There are more contacts of domestic family cluster infections, making epidemiological investigations more difficult and expensive.
32438579, However, the second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero.Domestic family cluster infections of COVID-19 have different characteristics and outcomes from couple infection and imported family cluster infections in this study.
32438527, The clinical situation is complex, with children presenting different clinical features compared to adults.
32438527, Several articles with recommendations on the anesthetic management of adult patients with COVID-19 have been published, but no specific recommendations for pediatric anesthesiologists have been made yet.

32438459,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious threat to public health and local economies around the globe.
32438459, This has created an urgent need to identify effective medications for its prevention and treatment (1).
32438459, Among these treatments, the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic derivate of chloroquine, has become a common practice among clinicians, including pediatricians, despite lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy for this indication (especially for pediatric patients) at present time (2).This article is protected by copyright.

32438448,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) doctors were redeployed to unfamiliar clinical teams, where they would work at the level of a fully-registered Foundation doctor.
32438448, As undergraduate clinical teaching fellows, we were re-purposed to rapidly produce a training programme to refresh the medical knowledge of doctors who were from a wide variety of non-medical specialities and grades.
32438448, Building on our experience of facilitating medical students, wedevised medical ward-based scenarios in an informal Objective Structure Clinical Examination (OSCE) style to promote focused active learning and prompt further independent study.This article is protected by copyright.

32438446, Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (ritonavir-boosted), tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (ritonavir-boosted) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50 . Nitazoxanide and sulfadoxine also exceeded their reported EC50 by 7.8- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively.
32438446, This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity.
32438446, Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.This article is protected by copyright.

32438005, We classified neurosurgical patients into 4 groups depending on whether their condition demands care in 0-6 hours, 6-48 hours, 48 hours to 14 days, and >14 days.
32438005, Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility.Despite not being a COVID-19 center, we consider all patients at the neurosurgical ward and staff members as asymptomatic carriers or infected in the preclinical period.

32437936, The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described.
32437936, Our patient, a medical person, had viral exanthem distributed in the extremities along with a "Spins and needles sensation," which differs from a previously published paper on cutaneous manifestations.

32437797, In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity.
32437797, Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options.
32437797, Also we have summarized the latest research progress on the usage of stem cell therapy, human convalescent serum, interferon's, in the treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32437770, However, a longer time on hemodialysis (hazard ratio 1.008(95% confidence interval 1.001-1.015) per year), increased LDH levels (1.006(1.001-1.011), and lower lymphocyte count (0.996 (0.992-1.000) one week after clinical onset were all significantly associated with higher mortality risk.
32437770, Thus, the mortality among hospitalized hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is high.

32437696, The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%).
32437696, The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in severe patients (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P<.0001).

32437596, Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy.
32437596, Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001).
32437596, In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection.

32437576, Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever.
32437576, Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath.
32437576, Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms.Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread.
32437576, The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.
32437575, The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]).
32437575, Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs.In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak.
32437575, That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics.
32437575, Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.
32437547, All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings.
32437547, In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days.
32437547, Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided.
32437547, Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread.
32437513, A reliable laboratory assay is essential both to confirm suspected patients and to exclude patients infected with other respiratory viruses, thereby facilitating the control of global outbreak scenarios.In this review, we focus on the genomic, transmission and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for SARS-CoV-2.
32437513, We also explore the quality assurance measures for these assays.SARS-CoV-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects, including the design of primers, the selection of specimens and testing strategies at different disease stages.
32437513, Appropriate quality assurance measures for molecular and serological assays are needed to maintain testing proficiency.
32437513, Because serological assays have the potential to identify later stages of the infection and to confirm highly suspected cases with negative molecular assay results, a combination of these two assays is needed to achieve a reliable capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2.© 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
32437432, The majority, 170(68.8%), felt self-efficacious to controlling COVID-19. 207(83.3%) believed that COVID-19 is a stigmatized disease.
32437432, Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices.
32437432, Knowledge status and self-efficacy (positively), older age, and unemployment (negatively) predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking.The status of knowledge and desirable practices were not sufficient enough to combat this rapidly spreading virus.
32437432, COVID-19 risk communication and public education efforts should focus on building an appropriate level of knowledge while enhancing the adoption of recommended self-care practices with special emphasis on high-risk audience segments.
32437242, Conclusion: All measures able to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection must be applied in medical oncology departments.
32437242, Early introduction of risk reduction measures may be a critical issue.
32437232, Etiology and outcomes are unique to individuals, making it difficult to cohort patients with MODS, but presenting a prime target for testing/developing tools for precision medicine.
32437232, Using multi-time point whole blood (cellular/acellular) total transcriptomics in 27 patients, we highlight the promise of simultaneously mapping viral/bacterial load, cell composition, tissue damage biomarkers, balance between syndromic biology vs. environmental response, and unique biological insights in each patient using a single platform measurement.
32437232, Integration of a transcriptome workflow yielded unexpected insights into the complex interplay between host genetics and viral/bacterial specific mechanisms, highlighted by a unique case of virally induced genetics (VIG) within one of these 27 patients.
32437232, The power of RNAseq to study unique patient biology while investigating environmental contributions can be a critical tool moving forward for translational sciences applied to precision medicine.
32437181, The current article draws from pertinent literature across topic areas of acute crises and long-term, cumulative risk to illustrate the multitude of ways in which the well-being of children and families may be at risk during COVID-19.
32437181, The presented conceptual framework is based on systemic models of human development and family functioning and links social disruption due to COVID-19 to child adjustment through a cascading process involving caregiver well-being and family processes (i.e., organization, communication, and beliefs).
32437181, An illustration of the centrality of family processes in buffering against risk in the context of COVID-19, as well as promoting resilience through shared family beliefs and close relationships, is provided.

32437077, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared similar clinical features.
32437077, Lower respiratory tract infection was less prominent in children as evidenced by the relatively low prevalence in chest pain/discomfort and dyspnea.
32437077, Similar to SARS, younger children had a less aggressive clinical course, compared with adolescents.
32437077, While fewer symptoms were observed in children compared to adults, there is not yet sufficient evidence to conclude shorter hospital stay in children.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32437033, The most common symptoms were fatigue (72.9%), headache (60.0%), nasal obstruction (58.6%), and postnasal drip (48.6%).
32437033, Total loss of smell was self-reported by 61.4% of patients.
32437033, Objective olfactory testings identified 41 anosmic (47.7%), 12 hyposmic (14.0%), and 33 normosmic (38.3%) patients.
32437033, There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip.A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients reporting OD do not have OD on objective testing.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32437022, All asymptomatic patients had a slight lowering of the olfactory threshold.
32437022, No significant correlations were found between the presence and severity of chemosensitive disorders and the severity of the clinical course.
32437022, On the contrary, there is a significant correlation between the duration of the olfactory and gustatory symptoms and the development of severe COVID-19.Patients under-report the frequency of chemosensitive disorders.
32437022, Contrary to recent reports, such objective testing refutes the proposal that the presence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may predict a milder course, but instead suggests that those with more severe disease neglect such symptoms in the setting of severe respiratory disease.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32437017, Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness.

32436460,Increased inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] are observed in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe group.
32436460, The phenomenon of a cytokine storm may be the central inducer of apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, which leads to rapid progression in severe group patients.
32436460, Given the similarities of clinical features and pathogenesis between toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and COVID-19, we hypothesize that the application of etanercept, an inhibitor of TNFα, could attenuate disease progression in severe group COVID-19 patients by suppressing systemic auto-inflammatory responses.
32436460, The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.
32436445, The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
32436445, The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT.
32436445, The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.
32436445, The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.
32436355, Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (i.e. the neutrophil count, LDH and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count.
32436355, Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels.
32436355, A steep increase of both ICU transfer or mortality risk was observed in men with TT<5 nmol/L or cFT< 100 pmol/L.Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected men admitted to RICU.This article is protected by copyright.

32436105, Four patients (67%) manifested acute kidney failure prior to stroke.
32436105, Four patients (67%) had abnormal coagulation tests.
32436105, The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: five died (83%) and the remaining one (17%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4).Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke can complicate the course of COVI-19 infection.
32436105, In our series, stroke developed mostly in patients with severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, liver enzymes and LDH were markedly increased in all cases, and the outcome was poor.
32436101, Neurological manifestations, or NeuroCOVID, are part of the COVID-19 clinical picture, but questions remain regarding the frequency and severity of CNS symptoms, the mechanism of action underlying neurological symptoms, and the relationship of symptoms with the course and severity of COVID-19.
32436101, Further clinical, epidemiological, and basic science research is urgently needed to understand and address neurological sequalae of COVID-19.
32436101, Concomitant risk factors or determinants (e.g. demographic factors, comorbidities, or available biomarkers) that may predispose a person with COVID-19 to neurological manifestations also need to be identified.
32436101, The review shows that although more and more papers are reporting neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19; however, many items remain unclear and this uncertainty calls for a global action that requires close coordination and open-data sharing between hospitals, academic institutions and the fast establishment of harmonised research priorities and research consortia to face the NeuroCOVID-19 complications.
32436029,COVID-19 is an emerging disease of public health concern.
32436029, While there is no specific recommended treatment for COVID-19, nitric oxide has the potential to be of therapeutic value for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32436029, However, inhaled nitric oxide has not yet been formally evaluated.
32436029, Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the large numbers of hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support, clinical use of inhaled nitric oxide may become an alternate rescue therapy before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32435925, The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%).
32435925, Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved.
32435925, The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with "white lungs." The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance.The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved.
32435925, Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption).• The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected. • CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression. • CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.
32435920, In addition, the tolerability of lithium as an antiviral agent should be addressed.
32435920, In fact, treatment with lithium requires continuous monitoring of its serum levels in order to prevent acute toxicity and long-term side effects, most notably affecting the kidney and thyroid.
32435920, Yet lithium reaches heterogeneous but bioequivalent concentrations in different tissues, and the anatomical compartment of the viral infection might underpin a different, lower need for tolerability concerns which need to be addressed.Lithium presents a clear antiviral activity demonstrated at preclinical level, but that remains to be confirmed in clinical settings.
32435920, In addition, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of lithium may provide an insight for its possible use as antiviral agent targeting specific pathways.
32435882, Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day).
32435882, The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation.
32435882, The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
32435882, These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.
32435879, Fever and upper respiratory symptoms were the most frequent findings.
32435879, Basal glomerular filtration worsened in 3 patients; however, recovery was rapidly achieved with rehydration and drug dose adjustment.
32435879, In 2 patients diagnosed with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, COVID-19 provoked a disease relapse.
32435879, None required oxygen therapy, and 7 could be managed as outpatients.COVID-19 disease appears to have a similar clinical course in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies, even in immunosuppressed cases, as in healthy children of the same age; however, special attention must be paid to fluid management and drug dose adjustment.
32435870, The prevention of nosocomial spread is paramount to proper control of COVID-19 and is reviewed.
32435870, Currently, treatment is supportive.
32435870, Researchers are working to develop vaccines and identify effective antiviral interventions.
32435870, Those recently discussed in the literature are briefly reviewed.
32435867, In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes.
32435867, Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly.
32435867, On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies.
32435867, Hence, the opportunity of the COVID 19 crisis should be taken to make a significant step forward in the care for diabetes patients.
32435272, A total of 8 patients received combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicines and western medicines.
32435272, From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method.
32435272, D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT(computed tomography) progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients, in our study, more 50% of patients had elevated levels of these indicators, but only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. 5 (56%) ordinary type patients had been discharged, while the 1 (11%) critical type patient died 3 days after admission.
32435272, Cancer comorbidity seems to have no direct relationship with severe events, and the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine may be effective in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NICP).© The Author(s) 2020.
32435173, Unfortunately, many data have shown that the high number of undocumented infections could have a major role in the rapid diffusion of the disease.
32435173, In most of the nations involved, non-urgent, non-cancer procedures have been stopped to reallocate medical and paramedical staff to face the emergency.
32435173, Moreover, concerns have been raised that minimally invasive surgery could be a procedure that carries the risk of virus diffusion in the operating theater during surgery.

32434635, Both cases were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32434635, They had obesity and a family history of hypertension.
32434635, Continuous blood pressure monitoring in the resting state during hospitalization showed that blood pressure was above the 95% reference interval of normal value for children of the same age, and the two boys were given calcium channel blockers or β-receptor blockers and were then recovered.
32434635, It is concluded that comprehensive management of children with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, should be taken seriously during the epidemic.
32434634, Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
32434634, All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered.COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results.
32434634, Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.
32434634, Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged <18 years.
32434633, One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×109/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (>400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (>1.6 mmol/L).
32434633, Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children.Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation.
32434633, Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests.
32434633, Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.
32434632, Wuchang PFTH is the first one to put into clinical practice and the last one suspended in Wuhan.
32434632, The National Emergency Medical Rescue Team of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, together with other 13 medical teams (841 medical staff in total), have fulfilled the task for the treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients, without any medical staff infected.
32434632, The first author of the article was the only pediatrician working in the Wuchang PFTH.
32434632, The author describes and summarizes the features/functions, management/operations, and advantages/challenges of the PFTH, in order to provide reference for medical institutions and relevant departments to deal with public health emergencies.
32434610, In forensic psychiatry and across all psychiatric services, urgent and clinically led responses have underlined redundancies and confusions in the governance of mental health services and a vacuum in policy makers.
32434610, For the future, a greater emphasis on services for patients with schizophrenia and other severe, enduring mental disorders must aim at reducing standardised mortality ratios, managing risk of violence and improving hard outcomes such as symptomatic remission, functional recovery and forensic recovery of autonomy.
32434610, This will require more use of information technology at service level and at national level where Scandinavian-style population based data linkage research must now become legally sanctioned and necessary.
32434610, A national research and development centre for medical excellence in forensic psychiatry is urgently required and is complimentary to and different from quality management.
32434597, Heightened public stress and anxiety levels, increasing isolation and the physical consequences of addiction play a large role in the proliferation and ongoing relapse of substance misuse and behavioural addiction.
32434597, Service provision is an ongoing challenge due to the increasing need for services given the increased mental health burden of COVID-19 but also the restrictions in place in clinical areas to achieve social distancing.
32434597, The necessary adaptations to service provision provide opportunities for the analysis of current processes used in our addiction unit and the introduction of new processes to our service.
32434597, The current crisis tests the sustainability of the service to provide the high standard of care required for these patients.
32434518, The NLR had an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.707 to 0.991) in the derivation cohort and 0.867 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.944) in the validation cohort, the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision and clinical impact curves showed that the NLR had high standardized net benefit.
32434518, In addition, the incidence of critical illness was 9.1% (1/11) for patients aged ≥ 50 and having an NLR < 3.13, and 50% (7/14) patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 were predicted to develop critical illness.
32434518, Based on the risk stratification of NLR according to age, this study has developed a COVID-19 pneumonia management process.We found that NLR is a predictive factor for early-stage prediction of patients infected with COVID-19 who are likely to develop critical illness.
32434518, Patients aged ≥ 50 and having an NLR ≥ 3.13 are predicted to develop critical illness, and they should thus have rapid access to an intensive care unit if necessary.
32434402, The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level.
32434402, Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans.
32434402, Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed.COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world.
32434402, Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32434400, The risk/benefit assessment and the main infection control policies in the clinical practices are also looked at.Regulatory agencies have amended their medical devices directives to address the pandemic, but each in a different way.
32434400, In this exceptional situation scientist and technology experts in collaboration with medical specialists should work together to re-assess the risk analysis on medical equipment management and their use and re-use in this context with the aim to improve global healthcare.
32434400, Every effort must be made to provide the necessary devices at least with the minimum acceptable performances for Covid-19 patients while maintaining a high standard of safety for users.
32434400, The aim of the present manuscript is to highlight the technical challenges in order to prevent, through targeted actions, operating standards from falling below the standards of care due to a lack of medical devices.
32434339, There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85 %), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37 %).
32434339, There was only one PCR positive subject.
32434339, Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals.
32434339, This article shows the pitfalls of the testing methods and highlights the necessity of using a correct testing algorithm, considering the character of the tested population and the expected low prevalence.
32434310, The chest CT findings exhibited no significant differences between the groups.Fever was found to be the most common symptom in COVID-19, and respiratory infection signs were also commonly present.
32434310, Fever and dyspnea were less frequently observed in the patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan, which should be considered in COVID-19 screening programs.
32434310, These results may be attributable to the earlier diagnosis of the disease and the younger age of patients outside of Wuhan although further analysis is needed.
32434310, The role of chest CT in COVID-19 diagnosis is inconclusive based on this study.
32434277,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, different types of cutaneous manifestations have been reported.
32434277, In Spain, there were reports in the first weeks of April 2020 of an increase in purpuric acral lesions similar to perniosis on the hands and especially the feet of children and young adults.
32434277, These patients do not normally present with clinical manifestations linked to COVID-19, and their PCR and serological tests are usually negative for specific IgM and IgG.This article is protected by copyright.

32434272, Hopefully, the efforts of clinical researchers in the fight against the SARS Cov-2 will result into the identification of effective treatments.
32434272, To make this possible, clinical research should be oriented by guidelines for more harmonized high-quality studies and by a united commitment of the scientific community to share personal knowledge and data.
32434272, Allergists and clinical immunologists should have a leading role in this unprecedent challenge.This article is protected by copyright.

32434254, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infections have, in part, successfully been treated in China by preparations from traditional Chinese medicine and, while it is too early to draw conclusions, some promising data are available.
32434254, There is huge potential, but intensified research is needed to develop evidence-based medicines with a clearly defined chemical profile.
32434254, Intensified research and development, and therefore funding, are needed for exploiting nature's reservoir against viral infections.
32434254, Combined action for basic research, chemistry, pharmacognosy, virology, and clinical studies, but also supply chain, sustainable sourcing, and economic aspects have to be considered.
32434254, This review calls for intensified innovative science on natural products for the patients and for a healthier world!Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32434211, Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes.
32434211, Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression.
32434211, High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count.
32434211, The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes.
32433799,Since the first cases in Wuhan, China, during the month of December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) evolved into a worldwide emergency, becoming one of the deadliest pandemics of modern history.
32433799, As we write, the outbreak has led to 3,595,662 confirmed cases and 247,652 deaths worldwide1 . SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the disease, is a single-stranded RNA virus which can cause a wide clinical spectrum of symptoms.
32433799, According to the available knowledge, a large but still unknown percentage of the infected patients remains asymptomatic, representing an important and insidious vehicle of transmission2 . According to the largest case series to date, most of the symptomatic patients complain of a mild respiratory syndrome (81%), while approximately 14% develop a severe disease requiring hospitalization and a further 5% need intensive care3 .This article is protected by copyright.

32433465, Here we build on this prior experience to generate a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
32433465, The engineered construct, INO-4800, results in robust expression of the S protein in vitro.
32433465, Following immunization of mice and guinea pigs with INO-4800 we measure antigen-specific T cell responses, functional antibodies which neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and biodistribution of SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies to the lungs.
32433465, This preliminary dataset identifies INO-4800 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting further translational study.
32433453, Preterm delivery occurred in 12% of patients, and nine newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.
32433453, Patients in the severe subgroup had significantly higher pregestational body mass indexes (BMIs) and heart and respiratory rates and a greater frequency of fever or dyspnea on admission compared with women with a nonsevere disease evolution.In our cohort, one in five women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection delivered urgently for respiratory compromise or were admitted to the ICU.
32433453, None, however, died.
32433453, Increased pregestational BMI and abnormal heart and respiratory rates on admission were associated with severe disease.
32433364, He had been trying to connect to a community buprenorphine/naloxone provider, but access was limited due to COVID-19, so he was using diverted buprenorphine/naloxone to reduce opioid use.
32433364, He was restarted on his previous dose of 12/3 mg daily which was continued via phone follow-up 16 days later.COVID-19-related regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation via telemedicine.
32433364, We describe 2 cases where telemedicine was combined with street outreach to connect patients experiencing homelessness with OUD to treatment.
32433364, These cases highlight an important opportunity to provide access to life-saving OUD treatment for vulnerable patients in the setting of a pandemic that mandates reduced face-to-face clinical interactions.
32433345, As the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic proceeds, many efforts are being dedicated to the development of diverse treatment strategies.
32433345, Increasing evidence showed potential therapeutic agents directly acting against SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as interferon, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, viral entry blockers, neuraminidase inhibitor, vaccine, antibody agent targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, natural killer cells and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking inhibitor.
32433345, To date, several direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have demonstrated promising in vitro and clinical efficacy.
32433345, This article reviews the current and future development of direct acting agents against SARS-CoV-2.
32433342, Many studies have published timely to help global health-care workers to understand and control the disease.
32433342, Vulnerable patients with risk factors such as elderly, cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension, coronary disease, or cardiomyopathy), diabetes, chronic kidney disease…etc., have worse outcomes after covid-19 infection.
32433342, COVID-19 could directly cause cardiovascular injuries such as pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias or thromboembolic events, which urge cardiologists to be involved in the frontline to practice.
32433342, Here we provide a review of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system to assist clinical cardiologists to better understand the disease and being capable of providing comprehensive medical support.
32433260, Patients with distal radius torus fractures were more likely to receive a velcro splint during the pandemic (44.2% vs. 25.9%, P=0.010).Pediatric fracture volume has decreased 2.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of cessation of organized sports and decreased playground use.
32433260, In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas.
32433260, Given the rising proportion of bicycling injuries, an emphasis on basic safety precautions could improve public health.
32433260, An observed increase in the prescription of velcro splints for distal radius fractures highlights an opportunity for simplified patient care during the pandemic.Level III.
32433217, This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity.
32433217, Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
32433217, The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
32433217, Furthermore, solutions for enhancing international strategies in translational research, cooperative networks and regulatory partnerships are contemplated.
32433216, A cut-off point of 150.44 μM could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower or equal to 150.44 μΜ and 4.1% with levels above 150.44 μΜ (p: 0.0008).
32433216, Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005).
32433216, Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL- 6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood.It is concluded that H2S is a potential marker for severity and final outcome of pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
32433216, Its correlation with IL- 6 suggests anti-inflammatory properties.
32433168, A retrospective review of her clinical and laboratory data was strongly suggestive for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
32433168, PET/CT images demonstrated hypermetabolic diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs with bilateral nodules.
32433168, There was no evidence of pleural effusion or prominent mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
32433168, Radiologists must be aware of COVID-19 presentations on PET/CT scan images during COVID-19 outbreak.
32433161, This was interpreted as a pattern highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the referring physician was contacted.
32433161, The patient was currently asymptomatic and without clinical evidence of active pneumonia.
32433161, However, the patient tested positive for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
32433161, This case demonstrates that even asymptomatic outpatients undergoing PET/CT should be evaluated for radiologic findings suggestive of COVID-19 during this pandemic.
32433010, We urgently need to find treatment and vaccine to stop the epidemic.
32433010, Vaccine development is in progress, but any approved and effective vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 12 to 18 months.
32433010, The World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have issued instructions and strategies for containing COVID-19 outbreak to the general public, physicians, travelers and injured patients to follow so that the transmission to a healthy population can be prevented.
32433010, In this review, we summarize demographic data, clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes and finally prevention and control of this serious pandemic.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
32432996, When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
32432996, Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32432996, Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased.
32432996, Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.
32432953, While some would argue that an OBE may reward good problem solvers, students still require a strong foundation of knowledge.
32432953, The luxury of reference will not be afforded in all clinical settings thus leading to concerns regarding students skimming over essential learning points.
32432953, Furthermore, we cannot ignore the increased opportunity for academic misconduct resulting from an open book assessment format.
32432953, Why are medical schools placing undue stress on students who could instead focus their attention on living compassionately for others during this difficult time?
32432527, Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results.
32432527, In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role.
32432527, Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed.
32432527, In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.
32432389, CONCLUSION: At the current level of disease in the United States, all three models have sustained major system stress in continuing reduced operation.
32432389, However, the small clinic model may not perform if either the current level of infections is maintained for long or staff becomes unavailable due to health issues.
32432389, With abundance, and diversity of innovative resources, medium and large clinic models can sustain further for physics-related radiotherapy services.© 2020 The Authors.

32432217, Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen.
32432217, Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system.
32432217, A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection.
32432217, In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).
32432121, Conclusion: In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.Copyright © 2020 Lu, Gong, Peng, Zeng and Liu.
32431755, Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures.A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit.In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2020.
32431217, Similar to N3 inhibitor, Wi-N and CAPE were interacting with the highly conserved residues of the proteases of coronaviruses.
32431217, The binding stability of these molecules was further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations.
32431217, The binding free energies calculated using MM/GBSA for N3 inhibitor, CAPE and Wi-N were also comparable.
32431217, Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.
32431134, Details of activities performed by the RPT in one typical working day are also shown.
32431134, Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs.
32431134, This re-organization can provide practical insights to other facilities that are facing this crisis, and may be a starting point for implementing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation.
32431134, Future studies will have to improve and review this organization.
32430996, This review provides a basis for further research and development of clinical applications of curcumin for the treatment of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.

32430957, From the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported.Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good-quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID-19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications.
32430957, In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses through meaningful good-quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into a registry or several registries.

32430840, Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period.
32430840, This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control.
32430840, Such a "schedule" of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable.
32430840, Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.
32430651, Another confounding factor is cigarette smoking, which has been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in both experimental models and humans.
32430651, Sex also plays a role, with chromosome X harbouring the gene coding for ACE-2, which is one of the possible explanations of why mortality in female patients is lower. Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, an androgen dependent enzyme.
32430651, Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies. We claim the need of adequately powered, prospective studies aimed at answering the following questions of paramount importance for cardiovascular, internal and emergency medicine: Do ACE-Is and ARBs exert similar or different effects on infection or disease course? Are such effects dangerous, neutral or even useful in older, COVID-19-affected patients? Do they act on multiple cell types? Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.
32430651, At present, insufficient detailed data from trials have been made available.
32430637, The latter was surgically evacuated after it became chronic and evidence of coronavirus was found in the fluid.
32430637, Our experience confirms that neurological complications might be a likely event in COVID-19.
32430637, Although uncommon, the possible occurrence of meningoencephalitis should be kept in mind by physicians involved in the management of COVID-19 patients.
32430637, Early recognition of brain involvement may provide better prognosis, preventing evolution into intracerebral hemorrhagic events.
32430627, Although experimental evidence on this topic is still at its infancy, the aim of this position paper is to hypothesize and discuss more suggestive cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 may lead to detrimental consequences to the cardiovascular system.
32430627, We will focus on aging, cytokine storm, NLRP3/inflammasome, hypoxemia, and air pollution, which is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor associated with rapid urbanization and globalization.
32430627, We will finally discuss the impact of clinically available CV drugs on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients.
32430627, Understanding the role played by SARS-CoV2 on the CV system is indeed mandatory to get further insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and to design a therapeutic strategy of cardio-protection for frail patients.
32430621, A comprehensive data collection, in the form of electronic case report form (eCRF), will register all possible neurological manifestations involving central nervous systems, peripheral nerves, and muscles, together with clinical, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid, if available), imaging, neurological, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological data.
32430621, A follow-up at hospital discharge (in hospitalized patients), and for all patients after 3 and 6 months, is also planned.
32430621, We believe that this study may help to intercept the full spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and, given the large diffusion at national level, can provide a large cohort of patients available for future more focused investigations.
32430621, Similar observational studies might also be proposed at international level to better define the neurological involvement of COVID-19.
32430617, In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these drugs against COVID-19.
32430617, Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them.
32430617, COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations.
32430617, Moreover, herein, we describe current evidence that may be changed in the future.
32430459, We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc.Our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection).
32430459, However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at false discovery rate <0.05).
32430459, Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning.
32430459, Further studies are required to verify our findings.© 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.
32430428, The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days).
32430428, Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
32430428, Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days versus 28.5 days, Log-rank p<0.001).Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19.
32430428, Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32430286, Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease.
32430286, Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32430286, Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32430088, A similar trend was observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (β value = 3.67, CI 1.44-5.89; P = 0.0013).
32430088, The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (β value = 4.44, CI 1.55-7.33; P = 0.0028).
32430088, In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases.
32430088, Governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate psychological intervention programmes, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety.
32429786, A natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia in the adult population was presented, as well.Conclusion: Currently, no evidence of vertical transmission has been suggested at least in late pregnancy.
32429786, No hazards have been detected for fetuses or neonates.
32429786, Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.
32429780, Counseling flow keys helping pregnant women to overcome misleads, regarding the COVID-19 outbreak is proposed.Conclusions: Non-infected pregnant women with a viable pregnancy at near term were observed to have positive attitude and compliance toward the COVID-19 outbreak and frontline healthcare staff; increased concern and vulnerability; and restricted knowledge about the pregnancy-related outcomes.
32429780, While the clinical evidence was growing rapidly, this data may guide obstetricians and midwives to perceive what accurate information should be provided to the pregnant women.
32429774, In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients.
32429774, The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology.
32429774, Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations.
32429774, Our deliberations and treatment recommendations are summarized here.Objective:To provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
32429769, Less than 1 percent of completed visits in the current phase were in the clinic.Conclusion:We provide evidence that telemedicine's robust and rapid scalability can help maintain a seamless transition of outpatient care during the pandemic.
32429714, The key changes were: first, floor plan adjustment, increase of the clinical area by converting some offices to clinical spaces, and standard operating procedures for transporting patients; second, enhancement of the efficiency of the communication and coordination between the clinical teams; third, availability of extra support for the staff in the Central Delivery Suite (CDS); and fourth, introduction of a neonatal care pathway to manage neonatal resuscitation in such an emergency.Conclusions: Collaboration and joint training between the different clinical teams involved in the care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients was proven to be one of the most effective ways of improving performance.
32429580, The study revealed that remdesivir exhibited an EC50 value of 0.07 µM against HCoV-229E with TC50 of > 2.00 µM against MRC-5 cells.
32429580, Parent NRTIs were found to be inactive against (HCoV-229E) at tested concentrations.
32429580, Among all the NRTIs and 5'-O-fatty acyl conjugates of NRTIs, 5'-O-tetradecanoyl ester conjugate of FTC showed modest activity with EC50 and TC50 values of 72.8 µM and 87.5 µM, respectively.
32429580, These data can be used for the design of potential compounds against other coronaviruses.
32429249, This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
32429249, With ongoing treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients other questions will come up.
32429249, While respective guidelines on these topics will serve clinicians in clinical practice, regularly updating all guidelines concerning COVID-19 will be a necessary, although challenging task in the upcoming weeks and months.
32429249, All recommendations during the current extremely rapid development of knowledge must be evaluated on a daily basis, as suggestions made today may be out-dated with the new evidence available tomorrow.
32429235, Emerging evidence suggests that AMPK facilitates central and peripheral reflexes that coordinate breathing and oxygen supply, and contributes to the central regulation of feeding and food choice.
32429235, We propose, therefore, that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat, but also nutrient-based diet selection, and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect.
32429235, Currently available information on how oxygen supply may be aligned with feeding and food choice, or vice versa, through our motivation to breathe and select particular nutrients is sparse, fragmented and lacks any integrated understanding.
32429235, By addressing this, we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential, by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise, in part, to known associations between metabolic disease, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, sleep-disordered breathing, pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32429193, To conclude, the COVID-19 emergency is having a highly negative impact on the activity of dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia.
32429193, All respondents reported practice closure or strong activity reduction.
32429193, The perception of this negative impact was accompanied by feelings of concern (70.2%), anxiety (46.4%) and fear (42.4%).
32429193, The majority of them (89.6%) reported concerns about their professional future and the hope for economic measures to help dental practitioners.
32429101,In this report, updated information and future perspectives about the use of saliva as a sample for laboratory analysis of the Covid-19 are highlighted.
32429101, Saliva can be used for the direct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the quantification of the specific immunoglobulins produced against it, and for the evaluation of the non-specific, innate immune response of the patient.
32429101, Moreover, a deeper knowledge of potential changes in the saliva proteome in this disease may allow the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, or even help our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the disease.
32429101, With the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays, saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis, disease management, and control of Covid-19.
32429099, Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity.
32429099, ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response.
32429099, PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro.
32429099, In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.
32429041, These features included fever, a dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea.
32429041, Gastrointestinal symptoms were rarely reported as a key feature.
32429041, We present a case report of a 74-year-old male who presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.
32429041, This article aims to highlight an uncommon presentation of COVID-19 and that a high index of suspicion is required for COVID-19 in older people given their greater likelihood of presenting atypically.
32429038, In total, 22 studies including 5595 COVID-19 patients were included in this study with case fatality rate of 16%. The prevalence of liver diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were 3% (95% CI; 2-3%) and 1% (95% CI; 1-2%), respectively.
32429038, In patients with COVID-19 and underlying liver diseases, 57.33% (43/75) of cases were severe, with 17.65% mortality, while in CKD patients, 83.93% (47/56) of cases were severe and 53.33% (8/15) mortality was reported.
32429038, This study found an increased risk of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with liver diseases or CKD.
32429038, This will lead to better clinical management and inform the process of implementing more stringent preventative measures for this group of patients.
32428965, Of the COVID-19 trials which included pregnant women, only three were randomized-controlled drug trials. Approximately 1.7% of current COVID-19 research is pregnancy related and the majority of trials either explicitly exclude or fail to address pregnancy.
32428965, Only three interventional trials worldwide involved pregnant women.
32428965, The knowledge gap concerning the safety and efficacy of interventions for COVID-19 created by the exclusion of pregnant women may ultimately harm them.
32428965, While "ethical" concerns about fetal exposure are often cited, it is in fact unethical to habitually exclude pregnant women from research.· Pregnancy was excluded from past pandemic research.. · Pregnancy is being excluded from COVID-19 research.. · Exclusion of pregnant women is potentially harmful..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.
32428957, The clinical examination shows fine crackles over both lungs and a respiratory failure of the husband.Laboratory increase in inflammation parameters as well as transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase.

32428207, Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes.Sensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at ≥ 15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG.
32428207, The median time to seropositivity observed for a reactive IgM and IgG result from the date of a positive PCR was 5 days (IQR: 2.75-9 days) and 4 days (IQR: 2.75-6.75 days), respectively.Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme IgM/IgG assays are suited for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32428207, For the first time, we report longitudinal data showing the evolution of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM in a cohort of acutely ill patients in the United States.

32428144, Based on supportive measures and infection control.
32428144, In severe cases, the use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or medication can be promising.
32428144, Take care to avoid the use of corticosteroids.
32428144, There are no restrictions on the use of resources and ACEIs / ARBs.
32428085, However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room.
32428085, In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects.
32428085, Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice.
32428085, However, they still need to be validated by future studies.
32428080, Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra.
32428080, Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity.
32428080, The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones.
32428080, Understanding these conditions of vulnerability can facilitate the development of strategies to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 and orient measures for prevention and health promotion.
32427924, Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32427924, In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist.
32427924, The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative.
32427924, When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.
32427809, In the setting of severe blunt trauma, damaged tissues induce a local and systemic inflammatory response through similar pathways to COVID-19.
32427809, As such, patients with COVID-19 sustaining orthopaedic trauma injuries may have an amplified response to the traumatic insult due to their baseline hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state.
32427809, These patients may have compromised physiological reserve to withstand the insult of surgical intervention before reaching clinical instability.
32427809, Herein, we review the current evidence regarding pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its implications on the management of orthopaedic trauma patients by discussing a case and the most recent literature.
32427774, These patients each required significant oxygen supplementation trending toward intubation.
32427774, After tPA therapy, all patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in PaO2 values overtime.
32427774, Three of these patients avoided intubation due to COVID-19 associated respiratory failure.Administration of thrombolytics was followed by overall improvement in patients' oxygen requirements, and in three cases, prevented progression to mechanical ventilation, without deleterious effects.
32427774, Clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy would further serve to underscore the efficacy and utility of this therapy.Level V- Case series of therapeutic effect.
32427773,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented stresses on modern medical systems, overwhelming the resource infrastructure in numerous countries while presenting a unique series of pathophysiologic clinical findings.
32427773, Thrombotic coagulopathy is common in critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19, with associated high rates of respiratory failure requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation.
32427773, Here we report a case series of five patients suffering from profound, medically refractory COVID-19 associated respiratory failure who were treated with fibrinolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase).
32427773, All five patients appeared to have an improved respiratory status following tPA administration: one patient had an initial marked improvement that partially regressed after several hours, one patient had transient improvements that were not sustained, and three patients had sustained clinical improvements following tPA administration.
32427637,The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on healthcare providers.
32427637, As the number of patients continue to surge, healthcare workers are now forced to find different approaches to practicing medicine that may affect patient care.
32427637, In addition, COVID-19 has many cardiovascular complications that affect the clinical course of patients.
32427637, In this article we summarize the cardiovascular impact of COVID-19 and some of the challenges that patients and the healthcare system will face during this pandemic.
32427613, Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782).
32427613, For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020.
32427613, Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32427613, Severe CO2 retention and acidosis prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indicated a poor prognosis.
32427582, SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II, type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis.
32427582, In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues.A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions.
32427582, Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both SARS-CoV-2 caused cytopathy and immunopathologic damage.
32427582, Strategies that encourage pulmonary recruitment and overactivation of inflammatory cells by suppressing cytokine storm might improve the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients.
32427529,In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering routine clinical care.
32427529, This transformation occurred as a crisis management response-driven by the need to provide care for patients with physical distancing measures in place.
32427529, However, the current rapid adoption of telemedicine presents a transitional state between one that existed before the pandemic and one that could potentially be better aligned with the delivery of a personalized model of care.
32427529, Using the conceptual framework of digital translucence-situating virtual encounters with more nuanced information regarding patients-we describe the role of integrated remote monitoring and virtual care tools aligned with the patient's electronic health record for adapting telemedicine delivery post-COVID-19.
32427403,An increasing number of COVID-19 patients worldwide will probably need tracheostomy in an emergency or at the recovering stage of COVID-19.
32427403, We explored the safe and effective management of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, to benefit patients and protect health care workers at the same time.We retrospectively analyzed 11 hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy.
32427403, Clinical features of patients, ventilator withdrawal after tracheostomy, surgical complications, and nosocomial infection of the health care workers associated with the tracheostomy were analyzed.The tracheostomy of all the 11 cases (100%) was performed successfully, including percutaneous tracheostomy of 6 cases (54.5%) and conventional open tracheostomy of 5 cases (45.5%).
32427403, No severe postoperative complications occurred, and no health care workers associated with the tracheostomy are confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.Comprehensive evaluation before tracheostomy, optimized procedures during tracheostomy, and special care after tracheostomy can make the tracheostomy safe and beneficial in COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32427216, All patients undergo a clinical and virologic diagnostic process before admittance and receive psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care, possibly beginning under quarantine conditions.
32427216, Furthermore, appropriate general hygiene regulations are explained.
32427216, Finally, what the patients are told is illustrated using a simple schematic aid: distance (minimum 2 m), rubbing (wash hands with soap often and for at least 20 s), avoidance (pass by in a friendly manner), alternative communication, forsaking (shopping is not always necessary), wiping (regularly wipeing of all surfaces by the cleaning personnel as well as tablet and mobile telephone by the patients themselves) and outside activity as much as possible, alone or sitting together (with safety distance).

32427184, Almost all countries started to take proactive precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.
32427184, The education sector, including pharmacy education, has been drastically impacted by this pandemic.
32427184, During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health profession's schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation.
32427184, In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the advanced pharmacy practice experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia.We believe that this experience could provide guidance and insights for other pharmacy schools dealing with this issue during this global pandemic.© 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.
32427171, Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment. (3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements.
32427171, Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission.
32427171, If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation. (4) Early intubation/mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).© 2020 The Authors.

32427166, By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression.
32427166, These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19.
32427166, Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.© 2020 The Author(s).

32427000, Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter, and 76% of all studies were single-center.Conclusion: Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy.
32427000, Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.
32426897, In addition, the authors point to non-anticoagulant activities of heparin, in particular anti-inflammatory effects with potential to prevent deterioration of the disease.
32426897, We would like to use this opportunity to clarify the biochemical background of the diverse activities of heparin, and further, how this information may be exploited to generate more efficient treatment of the viral infection.

32426755, But in the face of an emerging pandemic threat, it is crucial that we start to apply these principles to the clinic, the emergency department, and the hospital ward.
32426755, We propose that this dynamic situation calls for a parallel "Clinical Distancing" in which we as a medical culture go against many of our fundamental instincts and, at least in the short term, begin to reduce unnecessary patient-care contacts for the benefit of our patients and our ability to continue to provide care to those who need it most.

32426749, Data from such outbreaks indicate that severe systemic comorbidities including acute neurologic illness are associated with illness and lead to significant outcome differences.
32426749, Herein, we will discuss the neurologic manifestations of severe viral respiratory infections including coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus.PubMed and EMBASE were searched by two independent investigators up to March 2020.Data selection included preclinical and clinical studies detailing neurologic manifestations of viral respiratory infections.Two independent investigators reviewed and extracted the data.Neurologic manifestations including seizures, status epilepticus, encephalitis, critical illness neuromyopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute necrotizing encephalitis, Guillan-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and acute flaccid myelitis have all been associated with severe viral respiratory infections.
32426749, Having an understanding of the direct neurotropism of such viruses is imperative to understanding pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and potential treatment paradigms aimed at improving morbidity and mortality.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32426653, Several case series from Italy and China have highlighted the lung ultrasound findings of this disease process and may demonstrate its clinical utility during the current pandemic.We present a case of a COVID-19 patient who presented to the emergency department twice within a 24-hour period with rapidly progressing illness.
32426653, A multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) evaluation was used on the return visit and assisted clinical decision-making.A multi-organ POCUS exam allows for quick assessment of acute dyspnea in the emergency department.
32426653, As the lung involvement of COVID-19 is primarily a peripheral process it is readily identifiable via lung ultrasound.
32426653, We believe that when applied efficiently and safely a POCUS exam can reduce clinical uncertainty and potentially limit the use of other imaging modalities when treating patients with COVID-19.This case highlights the utility of an early multiorgan point-of-care assessment for patients presenting with moderate respiratory distress during the severe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Copyright: © 2020 Farrow et al.

32426374, We reviewed the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of COVID-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in previous clinical trials with positive outcomes.
32426374, We believe that targeting the central pathway (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), balancing the Th1 and Th2 response, and administering long-term anti-inflammatory therapy might be promising prospects to reduce cardiovascular impairment and even MODS during the acute and recovery phases of COVID-19.
32426374, The cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies might be of great application value to the management of COVID-19 patients and we further propose an algorithm for the selection of anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular impairment.
32426374, We recommend to take the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy as references in the management of COVID-19 and conduct related clinical trials, while the clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or in vitro drug screening should proceed with caution due to unguaranteed efficacy and safety profiles.Copyright © 2020 Wang, Zhang and Zhang.

32426209, However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis.
32426209, Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19.: Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia.
32426209, He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms.: This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32426111, It is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with "exposure risk" to COVID-19 for patients coming to clinic or the hospital.
32426111, If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation.
32426111, However, the COVID-19 outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work-up including potential exposure to COVID-19 versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high-risk, high likelihood World Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.

32426090, Unless relevant data emerges that changes our understanding of the relative safety of medications indicated in patients with asthma during this pandemic, clinicians must follow the recommendations of current evidence-based guidelines, preventing loss of control and exacerbations.
32426090, Also, with the absence of data that would indicate any potential harm, current advice is to continue the administration of biologic agents during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with asthma for whom such agents are clearly indicated and have been effective.
32426090, For the patients with severe asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, the decision to maintain or postpone biologic therapy until the patient recovers should be a case-by-case based decision supported by a multidisciplinary team.

32425712, Clinical support for immune system pathogen clearance mechanisms involves obligate activation of immune response components that are inherently inflammatory.
32425712, This puts the goals of the first clinical strategy (immune activation) potentially at odds with the goals of the second strategy(mitigation of proinflammatory effects).
32425712, This creates a need for discernment about the time course of the illness and with that, understanding of which components of an overall strategy to apply at each phase of the time course of the illness.
32425712, We review evidence from early observational studies and the existing literature on both outcomes and mechanisms of disease, to inform a phased approach to support the patient at risk for infection, with infection, with escalating inflammation during infection, and at risk of negative sequelae as they move into recovery.Copyright © 2020 InnoVision Health Media Inc.
32425657, In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.To determine the analytical performance of the ID NOW assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.Residual NP samples collected in viral transport media were tested by the ID NOW platform in two independent laboratories.
32425657, Results were compared to either the CDC or New York EUA assays, which served as reference methods.Overall agreement of ID NOW was 78.7%. Sensitivity was 71.7% and specificity was 100%. Notably, all false-negative results correlated to those samples that were weakly positive.ID NOW performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has reduced sensitivity for weakly positive samples.
32425657, This sensitivity, among other concerns, should be taken into consideration when using this test for patients with a low suspicion for COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32425653, With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities.
32425653, Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children.
32425653, This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region.
32425653, COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.© The Author(s) 2020.
32425651, The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
32425651, According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22nd March (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).
32425651, However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available.
32425651, Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.© 2020 The Author(s).
32425649, In this retrospective cohort study, we included 354 inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 4, 2020 to February 28, 2020.
32425649, We found levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, white blood cell count and neutrophil count were clearly elevated in males and critical cases compared with females and severe and mild cases, respectively.
32425649, However, lymphopenia was more severe in males than females and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha were reduced significantly in critical cases than severe and mild cases. 23.5% of severe cases and 24.4% of critical cases were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens.
32425649, Additionally, stepwise multivariable regression analysis suggested that co-infection, lymphocyte count and levels of D-dimer were associated with severity of COVID-19.These findings provide crucial clues for further identification of the mechanisms, characteristics and treatments of patients with COVID-19.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Institut Pasteur.
32425646, The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test).
32425646, In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p<0.05).
32425646, Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status.The diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients.

32425636, The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21).
32425636, Multivariable Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; p = 0.028) and time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding.This is the study with relatively large sample size that mainly focused on the duration of viral shedding and relevant factors in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China.

32425336, Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups.Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) patients had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase.
32425336, Out of 59 patients, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B).
32425336, Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4 vs. 33.8 years), with longer LOS (19.1 vs. 15.0 days), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7 vs. 18.1 mg/L), and higher maximal CT score (5.2 vs. 4.0) than those in group B.Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge.

32425304, The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children.
32425304, Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19.
32425304, However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32425289,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created new scenarios that require modifications to the usual cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocols.
32425289, The current clinical guidelines on the management of cardiorespiratory arrest do not include recommendations for situations that apply to this context.
32425289, Therefore, the National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Plan of the Spanish Society of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC), in collaboration with the Spanish Group of Pediatric and Neonatal CPR and with the Teaching Life Support in Primary Care program of the Spanish Society of Family and Community Medicine (SEMFyC), have written these recommendations, which are divided into five parts that address the main aspects for each healthcare setting.

32425269, Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation followed by maximal CRP.
32425269, Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83.
32425269, The calculated optimal cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6> 80 pg/ml and CRP> 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure.Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation.

32425268, Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed.
32425268, A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed.In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% versus 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-2.59, P = 0.818) and OS (95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, P = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group.
32425268, Three studies were examined for meta-analysis (median, n = 217), and a pooled HR for surgery wait-time of ≥8 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59-1.55).Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32425260, We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort.
32425260, COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 0.87%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 0.56 to 0.60%)], respectively.
32425260, We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002).Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32425234, SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively.
32425234, Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), ≥2 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7).
32425234, TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2).Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established.

32425222, We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2.
32425222, For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs.
32425222, CPZ + standard treatment).This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity.
32425222, This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects.© 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris.
32425199, Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise.
32425199, Conduction disorders, heart failure and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs.

32425183, In this phase, it is crucial to minimize the risk of infection to limit COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality and the number of new cases.
32425183, Indeed, COVID-19 manifestations may be equivocal, including asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.
32425183, In order to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare providers, therefore, it is mandatory to stratify the risk of post-COVID-19 pandemic infection during the clinical and instrumental evaluation of cardiac patients, who are at low risk for COVID-19.
32425183, Here we discuss the most common diagnostic procedures and therapeutic activities, the type of personal protective equipment according to the different tests, the timetable of the different diagnostic examinations, the tele-health services or alternative strategies, and the structural and management requirements, that should be applied to protect patients and healthcare providers in the post-COVID-19 era.
32425152,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019, a new illness with no effective treatment or vaccine that has reached pandemic proportions.
32425152, In this document, we analyze how health authorities and agencies around the world position themselves regarding the off-label use of repurposed drugs or new investigational drugs to treat Coronavirus Disease 2019.
32425152, We review the most promising candidate medicines, including available evidence, clinical recommendations and current options for access.
32425152, Our concluding remarks stress the importance of administering off-label and investigational drugs in the setting of clinical trials, or at least in standardized scenarios, to generate as much scientific knowledge as achievable while engaging in the best efforts to treat patients and save lives.
32425013, Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia.
32425013, Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy.
32425013, Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.
32425013, In this context, further studies are needed to optimise the decision making in therapeutic approach.
32425010, From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute.
32425010, Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses.
32425010, In accordance with the national standard "Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016)," we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.
32425010, Based on the experience we attained from the 12 severe COVID-19 cases in our hospital who underwent endoscopy 23 times in total, the article provides an improved version of endoscopic reprocessing guidelines for bedside endoscopic diagnosis and treatment on COVID-19 patients for reference.
32425008,As of Apr. 22, 2020, the World Health Organization (2020) has reported over 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 169 151 deaths.
32425008, Recent articles have uncovered genomic characteristics and clinical features of COVID-19 (Chan et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), while our understanding of COVID-19 is still limited.
32425008, As suggested by guidelines promoted by the General Office of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (2020) (from Versions 1 to 6), discharged standards for COVID-19 were still dependent on viral real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of respiratory specimens, showing that recovered COVID-19 patients with twice negative RT-PCR could meet discharge criteria.
32425008, Here, we examined two cases in which nucleic acid test results were inconsistent with clinical and radiological findings, leading to suboptimal care.
32425007, However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020).
32425007, It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies.
32425007, Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19.
32425007, In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.
32425004, In February 2020, the National Health Commission of China named the disease a novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); then, it was formally named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Feb. 11, 2020.
32425004, The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated this causative virus as SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32425004, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β coronavirus genus, and its pathogenic mechanism has not been clarified, which requires further study.
32425004, To better understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and more effectively prevent and control this disease, we retrospectively analyzed four representative cases of COVID-19 that had recently been screened and diagnosed in our emergency department.
32425003, Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group.
32425003, In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes.
32425003, On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients.
32425003, The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization.Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.
32425002, The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P<0.001).
32425002, The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015).
32425002, More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group.
32425002, There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups.From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history.
32425000, Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic.
32425000, Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development.
32425000, This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.
32425000, We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic.
32424745, Overall, the estimated mortality was 0.08%. A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%).Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults.
32424745, Laboratory and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific.
32424745, Larger epidemiological and clinical cohort studies are needed to better understand possible implications of COVID-19 infection in children.What is Known:• A novel Coronavirus has been recently identified as responsible for a new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) spreading globally.• There is limited evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection in children.What is New:• Systematically reviewed available evidence showed that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a less severe pattern of disease in comparison to adults.• Blood tests and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific in children but may help to identify those who are severely ill.
32424616, Clinical characteristics and treatment were retrospective analyzed.
32424616, Olfactory disorders are uncommon symptoms of COVID-19 in China.
32424616, Early diagnosis and intervention are keys to the recovery of olfactory disorders.
32424616, Particular attention should be devoted to olfactory dysfunction.
32424503, These symptoms, which include fever and dry cough, are frequently found in individuals with CoV infection.
32424503, Neurological manifestations of CoV have often been neglected; however, recent studies have reported neurological consequences of CoV infection.
32424503, Here, we review these literatures and discuss the neurologic impact of CoV while highlighting potential implications of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system.
32424503, We also discuss the possible routes by which these viruses invade the nervous system and the mechanism by which they may induce neurological damage.
32424429, Collected data included clinical history, laboratory results, treatment, and review of all available imaging.
32424429, Both patients demonstrated activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) within an appropriate therapeutic range.
32424429, No risk factors that clearly predicted likelihood of this complication were identified.Understanding the complications of ECMO in this cohort and developing therapeutic algorithms to aid in optimal patient selection will be critical in the limited resource setting experienced as a result of global pandemic.
32424429, We propose the use of head computed tomography (CT) to identify devastating neurological complications as early as possible, aiding in the resource allocation of ECMO machines to the most appropriately selected patients.Copyright © 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
32424327, Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR.
32424327, The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial.
32424327, However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures.
32424327, SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.

32423908, Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare characteristics of patients who required hospitalization versus those who did not.Of 41 patients, 22 (54%) had confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, and 19 (46%) were suspected cases.
32423908, Patients most commonly reported fever (80%), cough (56%), and dyspnea (39%).
32423908, At the end of follow-up, 13 patients (32%) required hospitalization a median of 8 days (range, 1-16) after symptom onset, and 23 (56%) had outpatient symptom resolution a median of 12 days (4-23) after onset.
32423908, Patients who required hospitalization were more likely to have reported dyspnea (77% versus 21%, P=0.003) and had higher baseline creatinine (median, 2.0 versus 1.3 mg/dl, P=0.02), but there were no other differences between groups.In an early cohort of outpatient kidney transplant recipients with known or suspected coronavirus disease 2019, many had symptomatic resolution without requiring hospitalization.Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.
32423903, D-dimer was elevated in both cases (confirmed VTE) and controls (no confirmed VTE) but higher levels were seen in confirmed VTE cases (4.1 vs 1.2 μg/mL, P<0.001).Incidence of VTE is high in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.
32423903, Urgent clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19.

32423833, This pandemic poses several challenges for oncology services.
32423833, Oncology nurses are providing a pivotal role in the care and management of the novel COVID-19 in the year landmarked as the International Year of the Nurse.It is too early to tell what shape this pandemic will take and its impact on oncology care.
32423833, However, several important clinical considerations have been discussed to inform oncology nursing care and practice.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32423449, The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe.
32423449, There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments.
32423449, Cellular based therapies hold great promise for the treatment of COVID-19.
32423449, This literature summary reviews the scientific rationale and need for clinical studies of adipose-derived stem cells and other types of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients who suffer with COVID-19.
32423435, Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type.
32423435, Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes.
32423435, One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins.The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various.
32423435, Accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT imaging data.
32423368, Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified age, sex, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, history of diabetes, and shortness of breath as factors predictive of intubation.
32423368, Age and body mass index were the only factors independently associated with time to extubation.In addition to clinical signs of respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 who are older, male, or diabetic are at higher risk of requiring intubation.
32423368, Among intubated patients, older and more obese patients are at higher risk for prolonged intubation.
32423368, Otolaryngologists consulted for airway management should consider these factors in their decision making.
32423324, Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.
32423324, In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding.
32423324, We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.
32423324, It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.
32423298,Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery underwent drastic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32423298, Since March 10, the first day of the lockdown in Italy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergency and oncology cases, while outpatient procedures and clinical examinations were temporarily suspended to limit virus diffusion and to reallocate personnel into wards dedicated to COVID-19.
32423298, In our otolaryngology unit, between March 10 and April 28, 2020, we performed 96 surgical procedures; they mainly consisted in diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors of the head and neck (77%), management of acute upper airway obstruction in adults and children (14.7%), drainage of abscesses of the head and neck (6.2%), and treatment of nasal bone fractures (2.1%).
32423298, When comparing these data with those of the same period in 2019 for emergency and oncology procedures, we noticed a drastic reduction of head and neck abscesses and nasal bone fractures, while oncology surgery remained stable.
32423297,Contemporary medical practice is grounded in rigorous scientific evidence in concert with best clinical practices and informed shared decision making with patients.
32423297, During these times of uncertainty, disruption, and even anxiety, it becomes critical that we engage with our patients and communities in thoughtful dialogue and realistic expectations regarding treatments surrounding COVID-19.
32423297, The hope for a "miracle" cure and urgency to return back to normal times can stimulate irrational thought and behavior and even desperate measures by individuals or groups.
32423297, It becomes especially important that we continue to use reasonable, informed clinical judgment in discussing the various options with patients.
32423296, The approach to the pediatric neck mass focuses on timely management for oncologic etiologies and cautious surgical intervention for abscess drainage or tissue sampling.
32423296, Finally, epistaxis and otorrhea must be triaged and addressed without the usual ambulatory procedures.Adaptation of practice patterns during this unprecedented moment for our health care system requires thoughtful planning.
32423296, The strategies described allow for safe handling of common pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses.
32423296, Ultimately, otolaryngologists must be stewards of our global health community while advocating for the care of individual pediatric patients.
32423293, Otolaryngologists are frequently called on for inpatient consultations for an array of pathologies, ranging from chronic benign conditions to acutely life-threatening processes.
32423293, Professional otolaryngologic societies across the world have proposed limiting patient care to time-sensitive and urgent matters; however, limited literature is available to describe how this transient change in philosophy may translate to clinical practice.
32423293, Here we present a structured algorithm that allows for rapid triage of otolaryngologic consults during the ongoing pandemic, in efforts to minimize infectious spread and protect clinicians while preserving high-quality patient care.
32423293, Considerations for managing these consults are presented, with a commentary on practical and ethical considerations.
32423292, A tracheostomy protocol was developed to guide management of emergent and elective airways.
32423292, Educational and research efforts were redirected to focus on otolaryngology care in the clinical context of the COVID-19 crisis.Emergence of the COVID-19 global health crisis has challenged delivery of otolaryngology care in an unparalleled manner.
32423292, The concerns for preserving health of the workforce while ethically addressing patient career needs in a timely manner has created significant dilemmas.
32423292, A proactive, thoughtful approach that reorganizes the overall departmental effort through provider and staff engagement can facilitate the ability to meet the needs of otolaryngology patients and to support the greater institutional mission to combat the pandemic.
32423250, Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment.
32423250, Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death.
32423250, In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
32423250, There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions.This review highlighted the ways in which coronaviruses affect cardiovascular function and interacts with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.
32423059, Accumulating clinical observations raised hypotheses to explain why some patients develop more severe disease while others only manifest mild or no symptoms.
32423059, So far, Covid-19 management remains mainly supportive.
32423059, However, many researches are underway to clarify the role of antiviral and immunomodulating drugs in changing morbidity and mortality in patients who become severely ill.
32423059, This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system and discusses recent findings on proposed pharmacologic treatments.
32423024, Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32423024, Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies.
32423024, This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32423024, All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.
32422983, The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection.
32422983, Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients.
32422983, As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary.
32422983, Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32422662, Among 84 patients who were initially classified as "outpatients", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days.
32422662, Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19.
32422662, One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea. This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept.
32422662, Adjustment might be necessary after further experience and after a growing number of patients.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32422426, Here we present two cases in which early manifestations of anosmia and hypogeusia were experienced with psycho-sensorial and atmospheric phenomena.
32422426, Psychiatrists, neurologists and physicians in general should be aware of this symptom presentation in order to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction might increase the risks of nutritional deficit and lead to development of adjustment disorders.
32422426, All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020.

32422376, We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.
32422376, This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe COVID-19 associated with remdesivir therapy.

32422349, Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004).Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32422349, Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.Copyright © 2020 American College of Surgeons.

32422081, We present a clinical-pathological correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis.
32422081, Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intraalveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphological alterations suspicious for viral cytopathic effect.
32422081, However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation.
32422081, This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.
32422078, Conclusions: No major complication were reported among the studied cohort, though one serious case and one perinatal infection were observed.
32422078, Much effort should be done to reduce the pathogenic effect of COVID-19 infection in pregnancies.
32422076, Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes.
32422076, Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile.The sample was small.COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency.
32422076, Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation.
32422076, Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory, and imaging studies and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.None.
32422062,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance.Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality.Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence.Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence).
32422062, Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence).
32422062, Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19.Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables.High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.
32422062, Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain.None. (PROSPERO: registration number pending).
32422057, On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%).
32422057, This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21.Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based.Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission.
32422057, If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins Health System, and U.S.

32421703, The model had good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.862, C-index of 0.863 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.925), and good calibration.
32421703, A high C-index value of 0.839 was reached in the interval validation.
32421703, Decision curve analysis showed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful.We established an early warning model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on admission.
32421703, This model can be used to help predict severe COVID-19 and identify patients at risk of developing severe disease.
32421627, In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing.
32421627, We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers.

32421541, Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus.
32421541, This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy.
32421541, Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32421539, We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19.
32421539, Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients.
32421539, Through this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32421497,The global COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the largest clinical and operational challenges faced by emergency medicine, and our EDs continue to see increased volumes of infected patients, many of whom are not only ill, but acutely aware and fearful of their circumstances and potential mortality.
32421497, Given this, there may be no more important time to focus on staff-patient communication and expression of compassion.However, many of the techniques usually employed by emergency clinicians to provide comfort to patients and their families are made more challenging or impossible by the current circumstances.
32421497, Geriatric ED patients, who are at increased risk of severe disease, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of isolation.Despite many challenges, emergency clinicians have at their disposal a myriad of tools that can still be used to express compassion and empathy to their patients.
32421497, Placing emphasis on using these techniques to maximize humanism in the care of COVID-19 patients during this crisis has the potential to bring improvements to ED patient care well after this pandemic has passed.
32421381, Conclusions: The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32421381, Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score ≥ 4 after admission.
32421381, Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in the hospitalized patients.
32421258, Frequent hand-eye contact may be the risk factor for conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients.
32421258, Screening of patients with conjunctival congestion by ophthalmologists is advocated during the outbreak of COVID-19.

32421102, These key candidate targets were mainly derived from phillyrin and chlorogenic acid.
32421102, Through the protein docking between S-protein and ACE2, it is found that Glu329/Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2 play an important role in the binding process of the two.
32421102, The results of molecular docking virtual calculation showed that phillyrin and chlorogenic acid could stably combine with Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2, respectively, which hindered the combination between S- protein and ACE2.Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can effectively prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2 at the molecular level.
32421102, Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can be used as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 for further research and development.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32420946,In children with food allergy the visits should be limited to those that are unequivocally needed on clinical basis.
32420946, Food challenge can be performed in selected situations, taking a more detailed history to make sure that patients provide whatever information we need.
32420946, The maintenance of a safe diet can be hampered by several factors.
32420946, Nutritional supplementation may be necessary.
32420943, The highest infection rate occurs in adults; however, neonates, children, and adolescents can also be infected.
32420943, As the outbreak continues to spread worldwide, attention has switched toward determinants of clinical manifes- tations and disease severity.
32420943, The situation surrounding the outbreak is rapidly evolving and the information and recommendations are changing as new information becomes available.
32420943, This paper summarises the cur- rent findings (April 3,2020) from a systematic literature review on the current knowledge of COVID-19 in adolescents (10-19 years according to the WHO definition) and reports the preliminary epidemiological data stated by the Italian National Institute of Health.
32420942, At present, though the limited data on the effects of COVID 19 in pediatric patients, children seem to count for a little proportion of SARS-COV 2 infection, and present with less severe disease and effects However infants and toddlers are at risk of developing critical course.
32420942, The disease has a range of clinical presentations in children, for which the potential need for further investigation of myocardial injury and cardiovascular issues should be kept in mind to avoid misdiagnosing severe clinical entities.
32420942, Overlapping with Kawasaki disease is a concern, particularly the incomplete and atypical form.
32420942, We aim to summarize the initial considerations and potential cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 for children and patients with congenital heart disease.
32420941, Its outbreak in many states of the world, forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic.
32420941, Currently, COVID-19 has infected 1 991 562 patients causing 130 885 deaths globally as of 16 April 2020.
32420941, The aim of this review is to underline the epidemiological, clinical and management characteristics in children affected by COVID-19.We searched Pubmed, from January to April 2020, for the following search terms: "COVID-19", "children", "SARS-COV2", "complications", "epidemiology", "clinical features", focusing our attention mostly on epidemiology and symptoms of COVID-19 in children.Usually, infants and children present milder symptoms of the disease with a better outcome than adults.
32420941, Consequently, children may be considered an infection reservoir that may play a role as spreader of the infection in community.
32420939, As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease.
32420939, Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection.
32420939, We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function.
32420939, This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.
32420938, The clinical presentation following human infection ranges from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.
32420938, We reviewed literature using Pubmed to identify relevant English-language articles published until April 15, 2020.
32420938, Search terms include novel coronavirus pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus and ventilation.
32420938, We summarized what SARS-CoV-2 infection means for the lungs.
32420936, Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented.
32420936, Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease.
32420936, This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes.
32420936, Ongoing clinical trials are also emphasized.
32420929, At first presentation, the most frequent signs and symptoms were: fever (71.4%), fatigue (35.7%) and cough (30.9%).  An  high  C-reactive protein value and abnormalities of chest  X-ray (bronchial wall thickening) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively.
32420929, Almost half of patients (45.2%) required hospitalization in our Pediatric Unit and one patient in Intensive Care Unit.Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition criteria is essential for clinical management and outbreak control.
32420929, Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults, as reported in our preliminary survey.
32420929, Further studies are needed to confirm our observations.
32420926, Actual understanding of specificity and sensitivity of POC tests was not associated with assessed behavioral outcomes: main positive effectors were identified in perceived reliability and usefulness of rapid tests, acknowledging the existence of official recommendations, understanding the limited clinical implications of POC tests, and working as occupational physicians were characterized as negative effectors.  Conclusions.
32420926, Propensity of sampled professionals towards POC tests for COVID-19 was diffusely unsatisfying.
32420926, While actual understanding of accuracy of such tests was not a main effector of propensity, previous experiences with other POC tests in daily practice, particularly among occupational physicians may have impaired overall acceptance of such instruments.
32420822, We critically appraise one of the most fundamental differences among policies, namely the use of criteria to categorically exclude certain patients from eligibility for otherwise standard medical services.
32420822, We examine these categorical exclusion criteria from ethical, legal, disability, and implementation perspectives.
32420822, Focusing our analysis on the most common type of exclusion criteria, which are disease-specific, we conclude that optimal policies for critical care resource allocation and the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not use categorical exclusions.
32420822, We argue that the avoidance of categorical exclusions is often practically feasible, consistent with public health norms, and mitigates discrimination against persons with disabilities.
32420788, Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
32420788, These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention.
32420788, In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern.
32420788, Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.
32420777, At follow-up on 26 March, she felt well, throat swab RT-PCR was negative, and isolation was lifted.Conclusion: The urine of asymptomatic patients may be contagious.
32420777, RT-PCR in urine might be a useful supplement in screening when the RT-PCR is negative in throat swabs.
32420751, The duration of fever in the NHM group (3.4±2.4 days) was significantly shorter than that in the control group (5.6±2.2 days) (p=0.03).
32420751, During the whole hospitalization period, the number of cases with diarrhea in the NHM group (two cases) was less than that in the control group (eight cases) (p=0.03).
32420751, Compared with the control group (7.5±1.6), the duration for improvement (DI) of chest CT in the NHM group (5.6±2.3) was significantly shorter (p=0.04).
32420751, Our results suggest that NHM could improve the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients and may be effective in treating COVID-19; thus, a larger, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial should be conducted to further evaluate the adjuvant efficacy of NHM in the treatment of COVID-19.
32420720, Coronavirus disease 2019 critical illness appears to be primarily occurring in adults.
32420720, Although pediatric intensivists are well versed in the care of acute respiratory distress syndrome from viral pneumonia, the care of differing aged adult populations presents some unique challenges.
32420720, In this statement, a team of adult and pediatric-trained critical care physicians provides guidance on common "adult" issues that may be encountered in the care of these patients and how they can best be managed in a PICU.This concise scientific statement includes references to the most recent and relevant guidelines and clinical trials that shape management decisions.
32420720, The intention is to assist PICUs and intensivists in rapidly preparing for care of adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients should the need arise.
32420710, Twenty seven (15.4%) patients required intensive care unit admission.
32420710, Overall mortality was 26.3% (n = 46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106; 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63; 12.69%; P <0.001).
32420710, Seventeen out of 29 patients admitted to the intensive care unit died (mortality, 58.6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.2% mortality rate).Polish patients with COVID‑19 have similar characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcomes to those observed in countries in which outbreaks occurred earlier.
32420710, Significantly higher mortality in patients transferred from other centers warrants special attention and transfer policy should be verified.
32420705, Therefore, frequent monitoring is warranted in at-risk patients.
32420705, However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach for monitoring, treatment and referral decisions.
32420705, This is particularly the case in patients with advanced age.
32420705, In this article, through the use of case examples, we aim to provide guidance when facing difficult management decisions in patients with (suspected) COVID-19.
32420674, In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time.
32420674, This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations.
32420674, Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures.
32420674, Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side.© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
32420637, A much faster and by far more efficient method for rapidly identifying approved therapeutics that can be repurposed for treating COVID-19 patients is data mining their past and current electronic health and prescription records for identifying drugs that may protect infected individuals from severe COVID-19 symptoms.
32420637, Examples are discussed for applying health and prescription records for assessing the potential repurposing (repositioning) of angiotensin receptor blockers, estradiol, or antiandrogens for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities.
32420637, Data mining of prescription records of COVID-19 patients will not cancel the need for conducting controlled clinical trials, but could substantially assist in trial design, drug choice, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and prioritization.
32420637, This approach requires a strong commitment of health provides for open collaboration with the biomedical research community, as health provides are typically the sole owners of retrospective drug prescription records.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32420607,A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out at 2019 and had caused a pandemic around the world.
32420607, This disease was found resulting from the infection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (Zhu, et al 2020).
32420607, The severity of COVID-19 disease has a wide range and varies from asymptomatic to critical severe, clinical researches reported that 10-15% of the patients were in the severe situation and required a great deal of attention of treatment and nursing (WHO-China-Joint-Mission 2020).This article is protected by copyright.

32419879, During the pandemic, insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infected and contagious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient be ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection.
32419879, According to the scientific data available, the examinations and procedures potentially exposing to projections / aerosolizations of organic material of human origin are considered to be at risk of staff contamination.
32419879, For ENT examinations and procedures without exposure to such projections / aerosolizations, the professional is advised to a long sleeve clean outfit, a surgical mask and gloves in case of contact with the patient's mucosa.
32419879, ENT examinations and procedures with exposure to these projections / aerosolizations require the so-called "airborne", "contact", and "droplets" additional precautions: FFP2/N95 respiratory protection device, eye protection, disposable headwear and long sleeve overgown.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.
32419876, In addition, the difference between the two groups showed an increasing trend during 1 week after admission.
32419876, This difference increased by an average of 5.3 × 10^9/L daily.In the early stage, platelet count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients.

32419721, We review available data on commonly used immunosuppressants and their effect on viral infections beyond COVID-19.
32419721, Notably, the effect of some immunosuppressants on viruses related to SARS-CoV2, including SARS and MERS, has been previously investigated.
32419721, In the absence of data on the effect of immunosuppressants on COVID-19, these data could be used to make clinical decisions on initiation and continuation of immunosuppressive medications during this pandemic.
32419721, In summary, we recommend considering the discontinuation of oral JAK inhibitors and prednisone, considering the delay of rituximab infusion, and the careful continuation of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, and biologics in patients currently benefitting from such treatments.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32419694, Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.
32419694, The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission.
32419694, Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.
32419694, This fact necessitates vigilant awareness in clinical investigation, management, and infection control, especially in tropical resource-limited settings.
32419568, SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained within 24 hours were positive, supporting prior infection despite relatively limited early symptoms of COVID-19.
32419568, Unusual clinical and radiographic characteristics included hemorrhagic abscess with blood of varying age in the first, intracranial epidural abscess in the second, radiographic signal consistent with hemorrhagic or thrombotic phenomena, retro-maxillary antral fat changes, and meningeal enhancement or extension in both cases.
32419568, Radiographic findings thereby mimic fungal infection, although final cultures and ancillary investigation for allergic and invasive fungal disease have remained negative.
32419568, These cases highlight two unusual orbital presentations of cellulitis occurring in the context of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.
32419558, A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women.
32419558, Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis.
32419558, Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus.
32419544, Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific.
32419544, Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32419544, Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters.
32419544, Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.
32419538, Consequently, hospitals have started to intensively reduce elective activities to face the high numbers of COVID-19 patients' admissions.
32419538, In Italy, all the non-urgent clinical appointments (such as primary prevention visits and elective surgeries) have been postponed.
32419538, We describe the reorganization of our Northern Italy dermatology department during COVID-19 pandemic, including teledermatology strategies.
32419538, Considering the unknown duration of this emergency scenario we wonder if this is just a temporary measure or the beginning of a new era in dermatology departments' organization?
32419524, The in vitro database, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
32419524, To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy.Expert opinion: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2.
32419524, In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome.
32419524, In future, clinical trials regarding a combination of potentially effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be conducted to establish the optimal regimen for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
32419495, In our country, the entire Italian Healthcare System has been forced to adapt to this unprecedented condition in this century.
32419495, The Head and Neck Department clinical and surgical activity was substantially reduced.
32419495, In this situation, the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) residents in University Hospitals find themselves in an uncertain position; we are physicians, facing a deadly disease about which much remains unknown, but we are also trainees, and there is a high risk for our residency training to be affected.
32419495, With this Letter, we would like to give a testimony of our experience and give some advices to bridge the training gap.
32419272, In Taiwan, a COVID-19 Open Science Platform adheres to the spirit of open science: sharing sources, data, and methods to promote progress in academic research while corroborating findings from various disciplines has established in mid-February 2020, for collaborative research in support of the development of detection methods, therapeutics, and a vaccine for COVID-19.
32419272, Research priorities include infection control, epidemiology, clinical characterization and management, detection methods (including viral RNA detection, viral antigen detection, and serum antibody detection), therapeutics (neutralizing antibody and small molecule drugs), vaccines, and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

32418460, Due to its highly contagious nature and unprecedented global spread, its aggressive clinical presentation and the lack of effective treatment, SARS-CoV-2 infection is causing the losses of thousands of lives and imparting unparalleled strains on healthcare systems around the world.
32418460, In the current report, we discuss perioperative considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and provide clinicians with recommendations to effectively triage and plan these procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32418460, This will help reduce the risk of exposure to patients and healthcare workers and allocate resources appropriately to those in greatest need.
32418460, We include an algorithm for preoperative testing for COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations, and a classification system to categorize and prioritize common cardiac surgery procedures.
32418446, Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C).
32418446, Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.
32418377, Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon.
32418377, However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32418307, There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus.There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19.
32418307, Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route.

32418146, Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3).
32418146, Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines.As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available.
32418146, This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.
32418146, Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.
32417996,To search for evidence base for using BCG in the fight against COVID-19 and the possible impact of these clinical trials on urology practice.A literature review about the basis of the ongoing clinical trials using BCG against COVID-19, as well as the use of BCG in urology and if there are any implications of these trials on our practice.Based on data from some epidemiological studies, there are some current clinical trials on the use BCG as a possible prophylactic vaccine against SARS CoV-2 which can affect urology practice.
32417996, Urologists are already struggling with the global shortage of BCG which can be even more aggravated by such trials.
32417996, In addition, if the ongoing trials proved the efficacy of BCG as a prophylaxis against COVID-19, this may open the door to more urological research opportunities to question the possibility that intra-vesical BCG, given its systemic immunologic effect, may have been protective to this subgroup of urological patients.The ongoing clinical trials using BCG against COVID-19 can affect our urology practice.
32417996, We need to stay vigilant to such impacts: BCG shortage and possible new chances for urology research work.
32417878, Key elements of the COVID-19 response included reducing the potential for patient and staff virus exposure; overcoming challenges in sourcing of staff, personal protective equipment, and medications; and changing care delivery practices to maintain high-quality patient care while maximizing social distancing.
32417878, The pharmacy department also created distance learning opportunities for 70 pharmacy students on rotations.
32417878, After an initial plan, ongoing needs include adjustment in patient care activities if significant staff losses occur, when and how to resume clinical activities, and how to best utilize the resources accumulated.
32417878, Elements of practice changes implemented to reduce COVID-19 threats to patients and pharmacy personnel have proven beneficial and will be further evaluated for potential continuation.The pharmacy department's efforts to respond to a natural disaster and unprecedented pandemic have proven successful to this point and have illuminated several lessons, including the necessity of cohesive department communication, staff flexibility, prioritization of teamwork, and external collaboration.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2020.
32417802, Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2.
32417802, Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial.
32417802, Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection.
32417802, The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.
32417768, The region needs to make strategic plans based on available evidence to enable them effectively deal with this rapidly evolving pandemic.
32417768, At this very moment countries like China, Italy, France, Spain, Iran, UK and many others are witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus and increasing numbers of severe disease and death particularly among elderly patients with other comorbidities.
32417768, The reality of the seriousness of this pandemic is alarming.
32417768, Government of member states of ECOWAS need to prepare themselves by building capacity as well as implement evidenced-based steps to mitigate this rapidly evolving pandemic by testing persons presenting with symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath), isolating and treating those found positive, tracing and quarantining contacts, implementing social distancing as well as optimizing human and material endowment to allow healthcare workers offer safe quality clinical care for affected patients to prevent secondary infection among healthcare workers.
32417701, The pandemic induced an international saturation of health care services and a rupture in the supply chain of protective equipment for healthcare personnel, which poses a high occupational risk to all.
32417701, Based on the different healthcare systems, human resources, infrastructure and medical emergencies that will warrant the conduct of clinical neurophysiology studies and the lack of a guide for the management of the situation, it was decided by an expert task force of the Latin American Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology to carry out these guidelines for the protection of patient and healthcare professionals conducting clinical neurophysiological studies.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

32415891, With regard to oral cancer, there is a complete absence of literature regarding the long-term impact of pandemics on patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs).
32415891, The objective of this article is to put forth an institutional multidisciplinary approach for the evaluation and management of OPMDs.A multidisciplinary approach was put formalized within our institution to risk stratify patients based on need for in-person assessment vs telehealth assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic.With judicious risk stratification of patients based on clinical features of their OPMD and with consideration of ongoing mitigation efforts and regional pandemic impact, providers are able to safely care for their patients.The COVID-19 pandemic has required health care practitioners to make novel decisions that are new to us with development of creative pathways of care that focused on patient safety, mitigation efforts, and clinical management of disease processes.
32415891, The care of patients with OPMDs requires special considerations especially as patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness are also higher risk for the development of OPMDs.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32415876, Current challenges include validation of outcome measures for remote assessment, as well as technological, regulatory and licensure barriers.

32415870, Communication between all members of a research team is key to adapting the development of clinical trials to the context of the epidemiological crisis of coronavirus.
32415870, We are accustomed to performing day-to-day tasks to fulfil protocol requirements with precision.

32415727, Globally, male patients (P = .001) with higher scholarity level (P = .005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19.
32415727, Patients with lower DLQI (P = .006), longer disease duration (P = .051) and lower scholarity (P = .007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy.
32415727, At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation vs discontinuation and modification vs no modification, respectively.

32415723, We aim to provide supportive guidance to clinicians making individual patient decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular during periods that access to healthcare resources may be limited.
32415723, General recommendations include those to minimise patient exposure to COVID-19, including the use of telehealth, avoidance of non-essential visits and minimisation of time spent by patients in infusion suites and other clinical areas.
32415723, This statement also provides recommendations where appropriate in assessing indications for therapy, reducing therapy-associated immunosuppression and reducing healthcare utilisation in patients with specific haematological malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415723, Specific decisions regarding therapy of haematological malignancies will need to be individualised, based on disease risk, risks of immunosuppression, rates of community transmission of COVID-19 and available local healthcare resources.© 2020 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.
32415481, To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
32415481, Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury.
32415481, SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated.
32415481, We would suggest that health professionals investigate cardiac function as part of the routine care.
32415473, Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers.
32415473, The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation.From 1st February 2020 to 31 March 2020, we reported an increase in the number of first medical examinations and treatments, compared to the same period of the previous year.
32415473, Outpatients first medical examinations have been spread over the 12 working hours.
32415473, No COVID-19 cases were detected.During COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced procedures that allowed us to ensure the continuity in oncological cares, with limited risks of infection for patients and staff.
32415472, Acute G1 or G2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurred in 43% and acute G1-G2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in 14%. Late G1 and G3 GU toxicity in 18% and 3.5%, respectively.
32415472, The G3 toxicity was not directly attributable to radiotherapy.
32415472, Late G1 GI toxicity occurred in 18%. 5yy bRFS was 96.5% (95% CI 82.3-99.4%).Stereotactic body radiotherapy for early prostate cancer reported safe toxicity profile and a good clinical outcome at the median follow-up of 5 years.
32415472, It may be an useful option if radiotherapy is required in emergency medical conditions.
32415419, Interestingly, some reports indicate that this wonder drug may be also beneficial for COVID-19 and accordingly, many clinical trials have begun.
32415419, Here, we discuss different modes of action (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inhibition of endosomal acidification, suppression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 glycosylation, etc.) of HCQ that might be responsible for its possible anti-COVID-19 effect.
32415419, On the other hand, this review also makes an honest attempt to delineate mechanisms (increase in vasoconstriction, inhibition of autophagy, depletion of T cells, etc.) indicating how it may aggravate certain conditions and why caution should be taken before granting widespread repurposing of HCQ for COVID-19.

32414407, Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles into their environments via body secretions.
32414407, Therefore, otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel in this specialty face a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and must remain vigilant when performing examinations and procedures involving the nose and throat.
32414407, In this article, we share our experiences of the planning and logistics undertaken to provide safe and efficient OHNS practices over the last 2 months, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32414407, We hope that our experiences will serve as pearls for otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel working in institutes that serve large numbers of patients every day, particularly with regard to the sharing of clinical and administrative tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

32413201, Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms.
32413201, Subjects in the non COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases.We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset.
32413201, Our data also suggests that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact-persons.This article is protected by copyright.

32412918, Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective.
32412918, Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time.
32412918, Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action.First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.
32412918, The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.
32412913, While "Live" patient contact is an irreplaceable tenet of clinical teaching, these extraordinary times demand exceptional measures.
32412913, Pedagogical innovations involving technology and simulation based teaching (Online lectures, video vase vignettes, virtual simulators, webcasting, online chat-rooms) need to be brought to the forefront.
32412913, Since the medical educators have been pushed inevitably to rely on technology-based learning, they should not only embrace it but also develop and evaluate its sustainability and application in preclinical and clinical setting.
32412913, Meanwhile, the students, whose medical educations are stuck in this pandemic time, should realize that there is no bigger teacher than a first-hand experience, and they are eyewitnesses to the making of history.
32412790, CONCLUSION.
32412790, CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32412790, Chest CT should be considered a supplemental diagnostic tool, particularly for patients who show symptoms.
32412779, Even short-term (1-4 wk) inactivity has been linked with detrimental effects in cardiovascular function and structure and increased cardiovascular risk factors.
32412779, In this unprecedented and critical scenario, home-based physical activity programs arise as a clinically relevant intervention to promote health benefits to cardiac patients.
32412779, Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different models of home-based exercise programs in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and major cardiovascular events among different populations.
32412779, This body of knowledge can inform evidence-based policies to be urgently implemented to counteract the impact of increased physical inactivity and sedentary behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby alleviating the global burden of cardiovascular disease.
32412693, The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics.
32412693, The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments.
32412693, This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.© 2020 The Authors.

32412509, Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated.
32412509, The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited.
32412509, Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results.
32412509, Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
32412303, Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a cellular receptor that allows it to infect different host cells, and likely disrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) homeostasis.
32412303, Particularly, it has been reported a considerable incidence of many renal abnormalities associated to COVID-19, including proteinuria, hematuria and acute kidney injury (AKI).
32412303, Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, which could contribute to the development of the aforementioned renal abnormalities.
32412303, In this review, we discuss the biological aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, how understanding current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection may partly explain the involvement of the kidneys in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and what questions arise and remain to be explored.
32412159, After a median of 33 days of follow-up, 16 patients were discharged, 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died.
32412159, These data suggest that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged SOT recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications.
32412159, These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.This article is protected by copyright.

32412101, The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19.
32412101, Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom.
32412101, The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia.
32412101, We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.© 2020 American Headache Society.
32411943, Migrants: 1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; 2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); 3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5 % versus 5/26- 19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005).
32411943, The study findings show that: 1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; 2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and 3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities.
32411943, However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.© 2020 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

32411359, We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS.
32411359, It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not.
32411359, It is fair to say that having read the current medical and lay press we conclude that it is not easy to reassure our patients with absolute certainty.

32411619, The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations.
32411619, In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs.

32411566, Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0026).
32411566, Nifedipine and amlodipine were found to be associated with significantly improved mortality and a decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
32411566, Further clinical studies are warranted.

32411552, The disease presents as a lower respiratory tract illness.
32411552, Anecdotal experiences have shown that imaging characteristics are crucial to diagnosis as radiological evidence of disease appears prior to clinical manifestations and tends to evolve over time, which can be useful in predicting the stage of the disease.

32411313, All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury and hepatobiliary dysfunction.
32411313, At the end-of-treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function and lower HScore.
32411313, Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis.
32411313, These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore and support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.
32411271, During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week.
32411271, Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing.In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption.This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing.
32411271, Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings.
32411271, Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic.Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity..
32410714, Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy.
32410714, By April 9, 2020, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital.Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of severe complications and need to receive an intensive level of treatments.

32410413, On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group.
32410413, On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group.Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators.
32410413, Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis.

32410412, Data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery.
32410412, Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values < 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge.Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days).
32410412, None died during the study period.
32410412, After controlling for age, onset time, lesion characteristics, number of lung lobes affected, and bilateral involvement, the lung severity score on baseline CT (> 4 vs. ≤ 4 [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.41 [95% confidence interval, CI = 0.18-0.92], p = 0.031) and initial lymphocyte count (reduced vs. normal or elevated [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.14 [95% CI = 0.03-0.60], p = 0.008) were two significant independent factors that influenced recovery and discharge.Lung severity score > 4 and reduced lymphocyte count at initial evaluation were independently associated with a significantly lower rate of recovery and discharge and extended hospitalization in patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.
32410347, This principle has important implications for where research will be conducted, how participants will be recruited, what questions will be investigated, and who will control the distribution of any innovations that result.
32410347, In the context of Covid-19, key issues include providing support to clinical trials in low- and middle-income countries, without taking needed resources away from other critical clinical and public health needs; designing recruitment strategies likely to generate sufficient enrollment from groups that have been disproportionately burdened by the virus, such as African Americans; supporting studies designed to improve outcomes in high-risk environments, such as nursing homes and group homes for the developmentally disabled; and ensuring that the medical products resulting from research are made available throughout the world at an affordable price.

32410266, It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration.
32410266, Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development.
32410266, If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented.

32410206, Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.
32410206, We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-α2b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.
32410196, We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients.
32410196, New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed.
32410196, We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

32410141, High level of expression in testis, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might not only attack the lungs, but also affect other organs, particularly the testes, thus it may severely damage male sexual development for younger male and lead to infertility in an adult male, if he contracted COVID-19.
32410141, On the other side, high expression of ACE2 was correlated with increased survival rate in renal and liver cancer, indicating that ACE2 is a prognostic marker in both renal cancer and liver cancers.
32410141, Thus, the ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and has a potential anti-tumor role in cancer.
32410141, Taken together, this study may not only provide potential clues for further medical pathogenesis of COVID-19 and male fertility, but also indicate the clinical significance of the role of the ACE2 gene in cancer.

32409625, We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are 'fit for reallocation' have been identified.
32409625, We claim that this process needs to attend to three questions that we consider in detail: (1) how the choice to make reallocation decisions is made, (2) what justifiable models for reallocation might look like and (3) what is owed to those who are reallocated.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32409504, Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment.
32409504, Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values <0.05).
32409504, Age ≥70 years (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.56) and hypertension (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.14-8.44) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death of patients with diabetes.COVID-19 patients with diabetes had worse outcomes compared with the sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes.

32408911, However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other.
32408911, Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures.
32408911, However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable.IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission.
32408911, This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.
32408845, A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3.Results - Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice.
32408845, Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks.
32408845, Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown.Interpretation - Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available.
32408845, Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.
32408730, Calling on previous experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during the 2015 outbreak, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy quickly formed a COVID-19 task force team to develop a manual before the first index case was diagnosed in the hemodialysis unit.
32408730, This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within hemodialysis facilities, which were developed to protect patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers from this highly transmissible virus.
32408730, The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.
32408730, We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and hemodialysis patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32408336, Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells.
32408336, Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication.
32408336, We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32408336, Furthermore, our findings provide insight for the development of therapy options for COVID-19.

32408070, Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication.
32408070, As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy.
32408070, Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32407289, It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic and financial impacts.
32407289, This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine.
32407289, In specific, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness towards public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation/ active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts.
32407289, It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.
32407284, The death rate for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 8.3%, and median length of hospitalization was 7.5 days.

32407051, Hyper-immune/convalescent plasma derived from recently recovered donors seems to be useful to treat COVID-19 patients, an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents.
32407051, The endpoints are the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of these patients.
32407051, However, the efficacy of hyper-immune/convalescent plasma treatment for severe infectious diseases is still controversial.
32407051, The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of hyper- immune/convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.

32406927, We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10).
32406927, Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event.
32406927, We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions.
32406927, We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low.
32406927, No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed.
32406927, There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin.

32406778, There is no valid evidence, published in English, which establishes any benefit of USWD in pulmonary conditions, let alone COVID-19.
32406778, The need for rigorous research and evidence-based practice is discussed in this article.
32406778, Novel interventions require a solid physiological basis and must undergo rigorous testing prior to clinical adoption even during a pandemic.
32406778, We are of the view that deployment of USWD in patients with COVID-19 must be prudent and supported by a logical scientific basis.
32406638, The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased.
32406638, Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels.
32406638, We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings.In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans.
32406638, Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as 'proven COVID-19 patients' using the algorithm.
32406637, Exactly one month later 8603 people had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 2500 patients were or had been admitted to the hospital and 456 patients died.
32406637, Here the clinical data are summarized of the first 236 patients that have been admitted to hospitals in Uden, Breda and Tilburg which were all at the centre of the initial outbreak in the Netherlands.
32406637, This commentary focusses on the clinical characteristics of the patients that are currently being treated on the Dutch clinical corona units, their medical management and the first clinical outcomes.
32406637, Data is compared to current cohort studies from China, Italy and the United States.
32406594, The composite outcomes risks were 5.47 (1.56-19.82) and 2.61 (0.86-7.88) times greater in group 2 and 3 than in group 1.Hyperglycemia in both diabetes and secondary hyperglycemia patients with COVID-19 may indicate poor prognoses.
32406594, There were differences between secondary hyperglycemia and diabetes patients.
32406594, We recommend that clinicians pay more attention to the blood glucose status of COVID-19 patients, even those not diagnosed with diabetes before admission.This article is protected by copyright.

32406551, Understanding the present situation is helpful for the prediction of future urological needs.
32406551, Based on the results of this study, we have reasons to speculate that people's requirements for urological services might grow explosively in the post-COVID-19 period.
32406551, There should be further studies about the real state of long-term urological services and the consequences that this pandemic may have in terms of morbimortality not directly related to the virus.This article is protected by copyright.

32406374, The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache.
32406374, This article is a narrative review with the aim of analyzing the current literature on postviral olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.
32406374, Since the initial anecdotal reports from China, international reports on COVID-19 patients have been increasing, describing a 5% to 85% range of loss of smell.
32406374, To date, the literature is widely heterogeneous regarding the loss of smell; therefore, we advise home isolation measures and/or social distancing, and to carry out diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 when possible in those patients with sudden and severe loss of smell who cannot be promptly evaluated.
32406369, Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals.
32406369, It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment.
32406369, The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses.
32406369, The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.
32406317, Molecular dynamics simulation further showed that Viomycin embedded deeply inside the binding pocket and formed robust binding with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.
32406317, Therefore, we propose that Viomycin may act as a potential inhibitor of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2.

32406305, This review aims to provide the basic information necessary for us, orthopaedic surgeons to prepare ourselves to face this pandemic together.
32406305, Herein, we cover the background of COVID-19, presentation, investigations, transmission, infection control and touch upon emerging treatments.
32406305, It is of paramount importance that we should stay vigilant for our patients, our families and ourselves.
32406305, Adequate infection control measures are necessary during day-to-day clinical work.

32406140, The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection.
32406140, Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect.
32406140, Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID-19.

32406001, In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs.
32406001, During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19.
32406001, These patients were treated with antiviral agents for COVID-19, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and immunomodulatory agents for rheumatic immune diseases.
32406001, All the patients responded well, were cured of COVID-19, and subsequently discharged.
32405974, Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19.
32405974, To improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality of patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19, this paper summarizes the experience of organ function support in patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19 in Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China.
32405974, This paper systematically summarizes the procedures of functional support therapies for multiple organs and systems, including respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems, among patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19.
32405974, This paper provides a clinical reference and a new strategy for the optimal treatment of COVID-19 worldwide.
32405955, Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges.
32405955, We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients.
32405955, This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring.
32405955, This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.
32405780, In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research.
32405780, By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period.
32405780, At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine.
32405780, The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.
32405641, Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.This article has been co-published with permission in the European Heart Journal and EuroIntervention.

32405423, The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available.Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone.
32405423, Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days).
32405423, Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US.Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices.
32405423, Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Virus Eradication published by Mediscript.
32405422, However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity.
32405422, We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS.
32405422, Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated.

32405421, There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001].Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs.
32405421, However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied.
32405421, Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment.
32405421, Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Virus Eradication published by Mediscript.

32405229, Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.
32405229, Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself.

32405164, The number of fatalities was fast rising.
32405164, Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov.
32405164, It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.

32404899,The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional risks among older patients with COVID-19 and their associated clinical outcomes using four nutritional risk screening (NRS) tools: Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002), Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), Mini Nutrition Assessment Shortcut (MNA-sf), and Nutrition Risk Index (NRI).We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years who were treated in our hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 5, 2020, and explored the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes.A total of 141 patients with COVID-19 (46 common COVID-19, 73 severe COVID-19, and 22 extremely severe COVID-19) were enrolled in the study.
32404899, NRS 2002 identified 85.8% of patients as having risk, with being identified 41.1% by MUST, 77.3% by MNA-sf, and 71.6% by NRI.
32404899, The agreement strength was moderate between NRS 2002 and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MUST and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MNA-sf and NRI, poor between NRS 2002 and MUST (P < 0.01).
32404899, After adjustment for confounding factors in multivariate regression analysis, patients in the risk group had significantly longer LOS, higher hospital expenses (except MNA-sf), poor appetite, heavier disease severity, and more weight change(kg) than normal patients by using NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI(P < 0.05).The NRS 2002, MNA-sf, and NRI are useful and practical tools with respect to screening for patients with COVID-19 who are at nutritional risk, as well as in need of additional nutritional intervention.
32404896, All patients recovered gradually.Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population.
32404896, Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity.
32404896, The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected.
32404896, This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
32404786, The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days.
32404786, There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment.
32404786, All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.
32404786, RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.

32404514, Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist.
32404514, A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective.
32404514, There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available.
32404514, This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine.Copyright © 2020 Triggle et al.
32404512,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the respiratory infection known as COVID-19.
32404512, From an immunopathological standpoint, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 induce increased levels of a variety of T-helper 1 (Th1) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, CCL2 protein, and CXCL10 protein.
32404512, In the absence of proven antiviral agents or an effective vaccine, substances with immunomodulatory activity may be able to inhibit inflammatory and Th1 cytokines and/or yield an anti-inflammatory and/or Th2 immune response to counteract COVID-19 symptoms and severity.
32404512, This report briefly describes the following four unconventional but commercially accessible immunomodulatory agents that can be employed in clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness at alleviating disease symptoms and severity: low-dose oral interferon alpha, microdose DNA, low-dose thimerosal, and phytocannabinoids.Copyright © 2020 Mamber et al.

32404302, Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
32404302, Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
32404302, In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
32404302, Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
32404258,Delusional topics tend to rapidly incorporate popular hot topical issues.
32404258, Thus, the current coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly reached delusional themes in patients with psychiatric disorders.
32404258, Here we present the clinical case of a Spanish woman with bipolar disorder that included coronavirus infection in her delusional themes even faster than the real infection reached mainland Spain.Copyright © 2020.

32404205, We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the profession's reputation.
32404205, The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students.It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy.
32404205, We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised.
32404205, We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.
32404126, We hypothesize that participants who are randomly assigned to receive 2-4 sessions of Solution Focused Brief Therapy would have better clinical outcomes than participants who are in the waitlist group.
32404126, We additionally hypothesized that using SFBT can also change participants' depression levels and their coping strategies in dealing with distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.This study employs a randomized delayed crossover open label controlled trial in adolescents who are presenting anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32404126, Participants who meet the enrollment criteria stated below will be invited to participate in this study through telecommunication.
32404126, Those accepting will be randomly allocated to the intervention group or waitlist group.
32404011, The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96 × 109/L vs 1.26 × 109/L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission.
32404011, The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.
32404011, Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
32403911, For example, the government adopted measures to curb the exponential spread of the virus, which included a significant reduction in social contacts.
32403911, Furthermore, the specialist societies recommended that no elective treatments be carried out during the pandemic period.
32403911, This review article considers epidemiological aspects of novel corona virus infection and presents both the clinical as well the possible economic effects of the pandemic on gynaecology, obstetrics and reproductive medicine in Germany in the past, present and future.
32403911, In addition, useful preventive measures for daily clinical work and the previously known scientific findings dealing with the impact of corona virus on pregnancy and birth are discussed.
32403255, A total of forty-three studies were included.
32403255, Liver anomalies were predominantly mild to moderately elevated transaminases, hypoalbuminemia and prolongation of prothrombin time.
32403255, Histopathology varied between non-specific inflammation, mild steatosis, congestion and massive necrosis.
32403255, More studies to elucidate the mechanism and importance of liver injury on the clinical course and prognosis in patients with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection are warranted.
32403182,May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold.
32403182, Governments are investing in public health, clinical and research efforts to avoid the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reduce the number of deaths and prevent the collapse of health care systems.

32403176, Therefore, front-line operations, such as emergency departments (ED), were highly stressed by immediate demand for diagnostic swab-testing, and additional personnel were urgently needed within a short time.
32403176, In the meantime, clinical activities of medical students (MS) were on hold, and teaching had to be restructured to online formats.
32403176, However, we expected that MS would benefit tremendously from learning opportunities through active involvement in this pandemic.This article is protected by copyright.

32402764, This has led to significant changes in the way geriatric oncologists provide care to older patients, including the implementation of novel methods for clinical visits, interruptions or delays in procedures, and modification of therapeutic strategies, both in the curative and palliative settings.
32402764, In this manuscript, we provide a global overview of the perspectives of geriatric oncology providers from countries across Europe, America, and Asia, regarding the adaptive strategies utilized to continue providing high quality care for older patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32402764, Through these perspectives, we attempt to show that, although each country and setting has specific issues, we all face similar challenges when providing care for our older patients with cancer during these difficult times.Copyright © 2020.

32402532, In a very short period, the medical practice framework has been changed to a 'catastrophe medicine' scenario, with the consequent change in the decision-making parameters.
32402532, In this context, the allocation of resources or the prioritization of treatment become crucial elements, and it is important to have an ethical reference framework to be able to make the necessary clinical decisions.
32402532, For this, a process of narrative review of the evidence has been carried out, followed by a unsystematic consensus of experts, which has resulted in both the publication of a position paper and recommendations from SEMICYUC itself, and the consensus between 18 scientific societies and 5 institutes/chairs of bioethics and palliative care of a framework document of reference for general ethical recommendations in this context of crisis.Copyright © 2020.

32402104, The WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
32402104, Clinical symptoms of the COVID-19 includes cough (67.8%), fever (43.8%), fatigue (38.1%), production of sputum (33.7%), and shortness of breath (18.7%).
32402104, Gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 include nausea or vomiting (5.0%), as well as diarrhea (3.8%) 1 . It is estimated that 1.2% of infected subjects are asymptomatic, but the rate of severe disease is 13.9% with an overall mortality rate of 2.3% 2 .This article is protected by copyright.

32402090, SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases.
32402090, Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19.Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.

32402061, Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative.
32402061, The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3d, 25.0% (95% CI; 8.66-49.10) at 3-7d, 56.5% (95% CI; 34.49-76.81) at 3-7d and 85.4% (95% CI; 72.24-93.93) at ≥14d if borderline results were considered positive.
32402061, The qualitative concordance between the assays was 0.83 (95% CI; 0.75-0.91).The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the EI assay.

32402056, Overall, 7 patients (25%) died.
32402056, Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization.In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT.
32402056, Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients.
32402056, Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.
32401931, Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
32401931, Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
32401931, All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
32401931, The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
32401715, One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis.
32401715, No patients died during the study.Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

32401673, A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema.
32401673, We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in Covid-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema.
32401673, Perplexingly, among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against Covid-19, none is designed to directly protect the alveolo-capillary barrier.
32401673, Successful protection of the alveolo-capillary barrier will not only reduce Covid-19 lethality but will pre-empt a distressing healthcare scenario with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.
32401670, Here, we discuss the contentious issue of whether the mainstay therapies systemic corticosteroids should be used in the routine management of COVID-19-associated asthma exacerbations.
32401670, Recent guidance from the WHO has advised against the use of corticosteroids if COVID-19 is suspected due to concerns that these agents may impair protective innate anti-viral immune responses.
32401670, This may not be appropriate in the unique case of asthma exacerbation, a syndrome associated with augmented type 2 inflammation, a disease feature that is known to directly inhibit anti-viral immunity.
32401670, Corticosteroids, through their suppressive effects on type 2 inflammation, are thus likely to restore impaired anti-viral immunity in asthma and, in contrast to non-asthmatic subjects, have beneficial clinical effects in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32401630, Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
32401630, Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19.
32401630, In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.
32401550, Local hospitals and care facilities are turning to makers to print essential consumable parts, such as simple visors, while in the hardest hit areas, critical pieces of medical technology are being fabricated.
32401550, While important and effective innovations are appearing almost daily, there are also some worrying trends towards hobbyists attempting manufacture of complex medical devices with little understanding of the clinical or scientific rationale behind their design.
32401550, The nature of the open-source community, an area of intensive innovation, fluidity, and experimentation, jars with the exacting standards of medical device regulation.
32401550, Here, we review the involvement of rapid prototyping and the open-source community in the key areas of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostics, critical care technology, and information acquisition and sharing, highlighting where makers and hackers have clashed with medical device regulations, and areas where the system has worked well to facilitate change.
32401361, Additionally, 6 patients' chest CT exhibited notable improvements in acute exudative lesions CONCLUSION: There could be the positive results for RT-PCR analysis or serum IgM-IgG in discharged patients, even with mild clinical symptoms, however, their laboratory outcomes and chest CT images would not indicate the on-going development in those patients.

32401227, The outcomes of morbidity and mortality and of infection control and prevention of planned hospital birth are clinically superior to those of out-of-hospital birth.
32401227, The obstetrician therefore should recommend planned hospital birth and recommend against planned out-of-hospital birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32401227, The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels for all patients and even more so for pregnant patients and their families.
32401227, The response in this difficult time should be to mitigate this stress and empower women to make informed decisions by routinely providing counseling that is evidence-based and directive.
32401215, Measures adopted to address the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technology.
32401215, Television sets were preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity.

32401210, The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital.
32401210, Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown.

32401079, The main areas of concern were: campus-based teaching and learning; clinical teaching; selection and assessment, and educator needs.
32401079, While there is clearly no one simple solution to the unprecedented issues medical education and training face currently, there were two over-arching messages.
32401079, First, this is a time for colleagues across the globe to help and support each other.
32401079, Second, many local responses and innovations could have the potential to change the shape of medical education and training in the future.
32401064, The current outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) illustrated difficulties in lack of effective drugs for treatment.
32401064, Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for early recognition and treatment of infectious diseases, allowing timely implementation of infection control, improved clinical care and other public health measures to stop the spread of the disease.
32401064, CRISPR-Cas technology speed up the development of infectious disease diagnostics with high rapid and accurate.
32401064, In this review, we summarise current advance regarding diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, in the development of fast, accurate and portable diagnostic tests and highlight the potential of CRISPR-Cas13 in COVID-19 Pneumonia and other emerging infectious diseases diagnosis.
32400965, Faced with this novel coronavirus, scientists have been trying to use drugs that have not been validated by rigorous clinical trials, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
32400965, These drugs may be used tentatively for general population with COVID-19, but for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with long-term immunosuppressive therapy and drug-related metabolic diseases, antiviral drugs should be chosen with particular care.
32400965, Notably, the elderly SOT patients commonly suffer from liver and kidney dysfunction of varying degrees, resulting in worse drug metabolism.This article is protected by copyright.

32400924, With contributions from the leadership of the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), Children's Oncology Group (COG), St Jude Global program, and Childhood Cancer International, we have sought to provide a framework for healthcare teams caring for children with cancer during the pandemic.
32400924, We anticipate the burden will fall particularly heavily on children, their families, and cancer services in low- and middle-income countries.
32400924, Therefore, we have brought together the relevant clinical leads from SIOP Europe, COG, and SIOP-PODC (Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) to focus on the six most curable cancers that are part of the WHO Global Initiative in Childhood Cancer.

32400380,The severity of COVID-19 disease has led to an urgent need for the discovery of new treatments.
32400380, Thus, global stocks of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been put under pressure with a study of 26 patients treated with HCQ during their infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32400380, Despite the study's lack of quality, several countries' medicines agencies subsequently issued guidelines for the use of HCQ for COVID-19.
32400380, This review aims to elucidate potential mechanisms, which make HCQ treatment interesting in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the current evidence for clinical use of HCQ to treat COVID-19.
32400366, Most commonly, the diseases are genetically inherited, but an acquired type also exists.
32400366, Ichthyosis vulgaris (IV), is the most common type, affecting 1:250 individuals.
32400366, Diagnosing IV can be challenging, because its clinical features are subject to great variation, ranging from mild cases with slight xerosis to severe cases with marked scaling and formation of fissures.
32400366, In this review, IV and its most relevant differential diagnoses, X-linked ichthyosis, autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis and acquired ichthyosis are reviewed.
32400087, Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart.
32400087, Other considerations including ethical, financial, societal, and logistical concerns are also addressed.
32400087, We conclude that, for selected patients with high waitlist mortality, transplant programs should consider accepting heart or liver transplants from deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32400074, However, at discharge SARS-CoV-2 RNA could still be detected in the nasopharyngeal swab and in the stools.
32400074, The second patient required mechanical ventilation, had a progressive deterioration of his clinical conditions and had a fatal outcome.
32400074, Further insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection is eagerly awaited to improve the outcome transplant recipients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia.This article is protected by copyright.

32400044,While elective cardiac surgeries have been postponed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and to reduce resource utilization, patients with urgent indications necessitating surgery may still be at risk of contracting the disease throughout their postoperative recovery.
32400044, We present a case of an 81-year-old female who underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting and was readmitted following discharge to a nursing facility with a cluster of COVID-19 cases.
32400044, Despite symptomatology and imaging concerning for COVID-19, two initial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were negative but a third test was positive.
32400044, This case emphasizes the risks of discharge location in the COVID-19 era as well as the importance of clinical suspicion, early isolation practices for those presumed positive, and repeat testing, given the marginal sensitivity of available COVID-19 RT-PCR.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32400017, At the same time, in the near future, clinical trials in COVID-19 patients will produce an enormous quantity of clinical and translational data on the control of inflammation, and complement/microthrombosis activation.
32400017, These data will represent a legacy to be transformed into innovation in the transplant field.
32400017, It will be our contribution to change a dramatic event into advancement for the transplant field, and ultimately for our patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32399995, The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), p=0.034.
32399995, There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.These results suggest overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.
32399995, Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.This article is protected by copyright.

32399950, During Italian severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 outbreak, a woman presented with a rapidly progressive flaccid paralysis with unilateral facial neuropathy after a few days of mild respiratory symptoms.
32399950, Coronavirus was detected by nasopharyngeal swab, but there was no evidence of its presence in her cerebrospinal fluid, which confirmed the typical albumin-cytological dissociation of GBS, along with consistent neurophysiological data.
32399950, Despite immunoglobulin infusions and intensive supportive care, her clinical picture worsened simultaneously both from the respiratory and neurological point of view, as if reflecting different aspects of the same systemic inflammatory response.
32399950, Similar early complications have already been observed in patients with para-infectious GBS related to Zika virus, but pathological mechanisms have yet to be established.
32399942, Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the COVID-19 crisis.
32399942, How can we best adapt as physicians and surgeons? What foundational ethical principles and systems of principle application can help guide our decision-making? Fortunately, a large body of work in medical ethics addresses these questions.
32399942, Unfortunately, many surgeons and other health care professionals are probably not as familiar with these concepts.
32399942, This brief communication is intended to provide a concise explanation of ethical considerations which readers may find helpful when addressing allocation of scarce resources and alterations in surgical care brought on by the current pandemic.
32399908, Two international aesthetic surgery society websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines, and one of the two had significant educational resources.The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is sparse.
32399908, In contrast, one international society website carefully analysed national and international recommendations and guidelines and made general recommendations for its members with regularly updated resources.
32399908, This study suggests that improvement and increase in COVID-19 information provided by many national aesthetic surgery society websites may be improved by links to the ISAPS website.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

32399710, Pneumonia in 50 patients with COVID-19 (45%) distributed in the peripheral regions of the lung, while it showed mixed distribution in 26 patients (74%) with influenza (p = 0.022).
32399710, The most common CT features of the COVID-19 group were pure ground-glass opacities (GGO, 36%), GGO with consolidation (51%), rounded opacities (35%), linear opacities (64%), bronchiolar wall thickening (49%), and interlobular septal thickening (66%).
32399710, Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p < 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p < 0.001).There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza.
32399710, Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.• Typical CT features of COVID-19 include pure ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation, rounded opacities, bronchiolar wall thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and a peripheral distribution. • Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.
32399655, Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26-0.82 × 103/µl) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23-1.02 × 103/µl).
32399655, In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients.
32399655, This series demonstrates the apparent safety of CAP-1002 in COVID-19.
32399655, While this initial experience is promising, efficacy will need to be further assessed in a randomized controlled trial.
32399455,Younger patients with COVID-19 may experience an exaggerated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life threatening.
32399455, There is no proven antiviral therapy for COVID-19 so far, but profound immunosuppression has recently been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19-associated CRS.
32399455, We present a case of life-threatening CRS caused by COVID-19 infection with a favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy with tocilizumab (TCZ).
32399455, The rapid clinical and biochemical improvement following TCZ administration suggests that treatment with immunotherapy can be life-saving in selected patients with COVID-19-induced CRS.Cytokine release syndrome may cause sudden and potentially life-threatening clinical deterioration in COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in younger patients.Immunosuppressive therapy may provide important additional therapeutic benefit in these patients.Tocilizumab, a specific IL-6 inhibitor, led to dramatic clinical improvement in a young patient with severe COVID-19-associated cytokine release syndrome.© EFIM 2020.
32399450, During his hospitalization in an isolation ward, he had no respiratory distress or fever but developed symptoms consistent with anxiety and insomnia.
32399450, Despite the appropriate supportive intervention, on hospital day 7, he attempted suicide by jumping from the third-floor ward.
32399450, The patient underwent urgent surgery and was transferred to a level I trauma center under strict isolation.
32399450, Our findings emphasize the importance of the mental health aspects of patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic requires social distancing, quarantine and isolation, which may precipitate new psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness or aggravate existing conditions.Mental health service providers, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers, should be available in every facility taking care of COVID-19 patients.Health workers treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and/or distress developing in their patients and colleagues.© EFIM 2020.
32399449, Risk factors associated with ARDS and death are older age, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia), neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction.
32399449, Disseminated intravascular coagulation and coagulopathy can contribute to death.
32399449, Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32399449, In this report we describe two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed venous thromboembolism.Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis does not decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 pneumonia.In the presence of clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, compression ultrasound and echocardiography should be always performed, irrespective of disease stage.© EFIM 2020.
32399375, Conclusion While limited in size, the study results support the expectation of a positive attitude toward neurosurgical e-learning, which translates directly to improving patient care and lessening the worldwide gap in neurosurgical education.Copyright © 2020, Downes et al.
32399213, Meanwhile, high IL-6 (from 251.8 to 6.32 pg mL-1), IL-10 (from 39.53 to 5.21 pg mL-1) and IFN-γ (from 13.55 to 3.16 pg mL-1) levels decreased, and IL-4 (from 2.36 to 3.19 pg mL-1) and TNF-α (from 2.27 to 20.2 pg mL-1) levels increased quickly when the viral RNA returned negative.
32399213, Moreover, the percentage of HLA-G+ T cells, B cells and monocytes follows high-low-high pattern, while the percentage of receptors ILT2-, ILT4- and KIR2DL4-expressing cells remained relatively stable.Our findings provide valuable information on the dynamics of early peripheral immunological responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32399213, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, cytokines and HLA-G+ immune cells are associated with the natural history of the critical COVID-19 patient; however, future studies are necessary.© 2020 The Authors.

32399192, Efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines include developing universal vaccines independent of the circulating strains in any particular season and stimulating cellular as well as humoral responses, especially in the elderly.
32399192, This commentary assesses progress over the last 3 years towards achieving these aims.
32399192, Since the beginning of 2020, an unprecedented international academic and industrial effort to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has diverted attention away from influenza, but many of the lessons learned for the one will synergize with the other to mutual advantage.
32399192, And, unlike the SARS-1 epidemic and, we hope, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, influenza will not be eliminated and thus efforts to improve influenza vaccines will remain of crucial importance.Copyright: © 2020 Pawelec G and McElhaney J.
32399096,The extreme health and economic problems in the world due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection have led to an urgent need to identify potential drug targets for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32399096, The present state-of-the-art tool-based screening was targeted to identify drug targets among clinically approved drugs by uncovering SARS-CoV-2 helicase inhibitors through molecular docking analysis.Helicase is a vital viral replication enzyme, which unwinds nucleic acids and separates the double-stranded nucleic acids into single-stranded nucleic acids.
32399096, Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein 3D structure was predicted, validated, and used to screen the druggable targets among clinically approved drugs such as protease inhibitor, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, used to treat HIV infection using molecular docking analysis.Interaction with SARS-CoV-2 helicase, approved drugs, vapreotide (affinity: -12.88; S score: -9.84 kcal/mol), and atazanavir (affinity: -11.28; S score: -9.32 kcal/mol), approved drugs for treating AIDS-related diarrhoea and HIV infection, respectively, are observed with significantly low binding affinity and MOE score or binding free energy.
32399096, The functional binding pockets of the clinically approved drugs on SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein molecule suggest that vapreotide and atazanavir may interrupt the activities of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase.The study suggests that vapreotide may be a choice of drug for wet lab studies to inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright: © 2020 Termedia & Banach.
32398954, CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human deaths worldwide.
32398954, Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020.
32398954, Its risks and pandemic potential have brought global consideration.
32398954, We summarized epidemiology, virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.© The author(s).
32398569, Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.
32398569, Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.
32398569, Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.
32398569, Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.
32398343, A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone.There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection.
32398343, There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine.
32398343, The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established.
32398343, Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.Copyright © 2020, The Authors.
32398268, During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever).
32398268, The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home.LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray.
32398268, We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.© Royal College of Physicians 2020.

32398164, This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use.
32398164, Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy.
32398164, Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the "viral program". Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication.To our knowledge, cancer drugs potentially suitable for facing SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been carefully reviewed.
32398164, We present here a comprehensive analysis of available information on potential candidate cancer drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of COIVD-19.
32398026, In this manner, the non-specific activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer.
32398026, The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-ϒ, creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity.
32398026, These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter.Allo-priming has potential to provide universal protection from viral disease and is a strategy to reverse immunosenescence and counter-regulate chronic inflammation (inflammaging).
32398026, Allo-priming can be used as an adjuvant for anti-viral vaccines and as a counter-measure for unknown biological threats and bio-economic terrorism.
32397951, In conclusion, this review may provide useful information to develop some strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
32397940, Top three bioactive molecules (Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate) were selected by comparing their docking scores with repurposed drugs (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) against SARS-CoV-2.
32397940, Oolonghomobisflavan-A molecule showed a good number of hydrogen bonds with Mpro and higher MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to all three repurposed drug molecules. during the time of simulation.
32397940, This study showed Oolonghomobisflavan-A as a potential bioactive molecule to act as an inhibitor for the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. [Formula: see text]Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32397915, Several studies have identified a link between severe COVID-19 patients and specific coagulation index, in particular, high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, and low PLT count.
32397915, These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs, as well as in other organs.
32397915, Further information and more advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs are needed to better estimate this link, also considering COVID-19 patients at different disease stages and stratified in different cohorts based on preexisting co-morbidity, age, and gender.
32397915, Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients.
32397911, Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation.
32397911, Several antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated.
32397911, In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results.
32397911, The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.
32397906, Afterwards, we discussed the kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV proliferation in animal models which is significantly different compared to that in humans.
32397906, Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective on the application of RDV either alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents against CoVs infection were surveyed to determine the efficiency of RDV in preclinical trials.
32397906, As a result, this paper provides crucial evidence of the potency of RDV to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32397643, We employed ≈9000 U.S.
32397643, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved investigational and experimental drugs from the DrugBank repository for docking virtual screening.
32397643, After molecular dynamics calculations of the stability of the binding modes of high-scoring nsp16/nsp10-drug complexes, we considered their pharmacological overlapping with functional modules of the virus-host interactome that is relevant to the viral lifecycle, and to the clinical features of COVID-19.
32397643, Some of the predicted drugs (e.g., tegobuvir, sonidegib, siramesine, antrafenine, bemcentinib, itacitinib, or phthalocyanine) might be suitable for repurposing to pharmacologically reactivate innate immune restriction and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation.
32397530, Despite the imperative need to continuously practice eye operations to avoid the abovementioned problems, there are currently little-shared and vague recommendations among the various countries on safety in operating rooms (for health care workers and patients) and poor legal protection for surgeons (potentially transmitting the COVID-19 infectious agent).
32397530, Herein, we individuated and discussed some critical points in safety recommendations and medical liability.
32397530, A paradigm shift for ocular surgery during the COVID-19 era is now mandatory.
32397530, While telemedicine has been able to solve some problems in clinical ophthalmology, the lack of adequate health and legal protection for surgeons and patients may result in an excessive reduction in the volume of surgical interventions during a pandemic era and the immediately following period, thus determining inability to ensure health care to all patients.
32397511, Many authors have suggested the involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk of infections; thus, we retrospectively investigated the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in plasma obtained from a cohort of patients from Switzerland.
32397511, In this cohort, significantly lower 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.004) were found in PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with negative patients (24.6 ng/mL); this was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age >70 years.
32397511, On the basis of this preliminary observation, vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce the risk of infection.
32397511, Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations and to confirm our preliminary observation.
32397399, Conclusions: TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients.
32397399, Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32397182, Here we review the development of recombinant influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines against H7N9 virus.
32397182, Several approaches to vaccine development are reviewed including the expression of VLPs in mammalian, plant and insect cell expression systems.
32397182, Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed.
32397182, These challenges include improvements to the manufacturing processes, as well as enhancements to immunogenicity in order to elicit protective immunity to multiple variants and subtypes of influenza virus.
32397174, Indeed, treatment of CRS involves the use of both antivirals to control the underlying infection and immunosuppressive agents to dampen the aberrant pro-inflammatory response of the host.
32397174, Several trials, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressants commonly used in rheumatic diseases, are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 and CRS, some of which are achieving promising results.
32397174, However, such a use should follow a multidisciplinary approach, be accompanied by close monitoring, be tailored to patient's clinical and serological features, and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results.
32397174, Autoimmune patients receiving immunosuppressants could be prone to SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, suspension of the ongoing therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares and a consequent increase in the infection risk.
32397011, Glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 60 (12.90%) and 218(46.88%) patients, respectively.
32397011, Bioinformatics showed four single amino acid mutations and one amino acid position loss in SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province, with more similarity to humans than to viruses.SARS-CoV-2 showed virological mutations and more human transmission in Zhejiang province, indicating considerable epidemiological and clinical changes.
32397011, Caution in glucocorticoid and antibiotics use is advisable.© 2020 The Authors.

32396999, They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes.
32396999, Skin biopsies performed on each of the 6 patients demonstrated near identical histopathologic findings to those of idiopathic perniosis, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of thromboembolism or immune complex vasculitis.
32396999, While SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1-2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure.We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent-phase cutaneous reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32396948, Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling.
32396948, Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care.
32396948, While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services.

32396947, Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested.
32396947, Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 0/7 weeks of gestation.
32396947, With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 0/7 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features.

32396877, Stringent infection control measures have been taken to minimise the transmission between individuals and healthcare workers, especially those undertaking aerosols generating medical procedures.
32396877, The uncertainties surrounding infection transmission through breath tests in particular, and to some extent faecal testing, will invariably cause concerns among both the patients and the healthcare workers.
32396877, It is therefore pertinent that all of the necessary measures are adopted to minimise this risk of spreading.
32396877, In this article, we summarise the physiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the implications for breath testing (in both the clinical and research arena) as well as outlining methods to mitigate these risks.© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.
32396771, We have also displayed the ongoing clinical trials, as well as a published study that was conducted on compassionate base.
32396771, The covid-19 pandemic might wean down by the end of summer 2020, but the risk of seasonality exists.
32396771, Therefore, future disposal of agents such as remdesivir might be crucial for ensuring an efficient treatment, decrease mortality and allow early discharge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32396769, However, based on control (N3 and 13b), we have identified six potential molecules, Leupeptin Hemisulphate, Pepstatin A, Nelfinavir, Birinapant, Lypression and Octreotide which have shown the reasonably significant MM-GBSA score.
32396769, Further insight shows that the molecules form stable interactions with hot-spot residues, that are mainly conserved and can be targeted for structure- and pharmacophore-based designing.
32396769, The pharmacokinetic annotations and therapeutic importance have suggested that these molecules possess drug-like properties and pave their way for in-vitro studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32396759, With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, false beliefs about methanol's preventive potential vs viral infection of have arisen.
32396759, In March of this year, more than 300 Iranians died and 1000 became ill after consuming methanol in the hope that it would protect them against the novel coronavirus.
32396759, We review the context and magnitude of methanol toxicity, pathophysiology, principal medical issues, and human variability in metabolism.
32396759, While toxicologists and clinicians may need to be especially attentive to this problem, it is becoming clear that the social and economic underpinnings of the methanol poisoning crisis must be actively and urgently explored and managed as vigorously as its toxicologic and pathophysiologic components.
32396505, All assays performed comparably with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretions, serum, and fecal specimens spiked with cultured virus.
32396505, We obtained no false-positive amplifications with other human coronaviruses or common respiratory pathogens.
32396505, Results from all 3 assays were highly correlated during clinical specimen testing.
32396505, On February 4, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to enable emergency use of this panel.
32396491, Interactions with sponsors and CROs about modifying trial procedures were also challenging.
32396491, The changes in clinical trial procedures identified by the survey could serve as strategies for other programs attempting to maintain their clinical trial portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32396491, Additionally, many of the adaptations to trials made during the pandemic provide a long-term opportunity to improve and transform the clinical trial system.
32396491, Specific improvements could be expanded use of more pragmatic or streamlined trial designs, fewer clinical trial-related patient visits, and minimized sponsor and CRO visits to trial programs.
32396384, Besides mounting a massive response to the viral outbreak, healthcare systems needed to consider provision of clinical services to other patients in need.
32396384, Surgical services for patients with thoracic disease were maintained to different degrees across various regions of Asia, ranging from significant reductions to near-normal service.
32396384, Key determinants of robust thoracic surgery service provision included: preexisting plans for an epidemic response, aggressive early action to "flatten the curve", ability to dedicate resources separately to COVID-19 and routine clinical services, prioritization of thoracic surgery, and the volume of COVID-19 cases in that region.
32396384, The lessons learned can apply to other regions during this pandemic, and to the world, in preparation for the next one.
32396239, The prevalence of LPRD may be higher than the general population, which indicated that COVID-19 can impair the upper esophageal sphincter and aggravate reflux.

32396163, The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%).
32396163, From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24).
32396163, The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93).
32396163, The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/).In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness.
32396143, These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020.Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged.
32396143, Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death.Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities.
32396143, Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death.
32396143, Therefore, it is best to be regularly assessed these markers during treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32396137,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the third coronavirus outbreak that has emerged in the past 20 years, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32396137, One important aspect, highlighted by many global health organizations, is that this novel coronavirus outbreak may be especially hazardous to healthcare personnel, including laboratory professionals.
32396137, Therefore, the aim of this document, prepared by the COVID-19 taskforce of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), is to provide a set of recommendations, adapted from official documents of international and national health agencies, on biosafety measures for routine clinical chemistry laboratories that operate at biosafety levels 1 (BSL-1; work with agents posing minimal threat to laboratory workers) and 2 (BSL-2; work with agents associated with human disease which pose moderate hazard).
32396137, We believe that the interim measures proposed in this document for best practice will help minimazing the risk of developing COVID-19 while working in clinical laboratories.
32396101, While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention.
32396101, The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis.
32396101, The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.
32396101, Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.
32396075, Unfortunately, due to the emergent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic collection of CXR data set for deep neural network training is difficult.
32396075, To address this problem, here we propose a patch-based convolutional neural network approach with a relatively small number of trainable parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis.
32396075, The proposed method is inspired by our statistical analysis of the potential imaging biomarkers of the CXR radiographs.
32396075, Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides clinically interpretable saliency maps, which are useful for COVID-19 diagnosis and patient triage.
32395966, The degree of frailty, resilience and number of co-morbidities caused COVID-19 to present as acute geriatric syndrome events such as falls, delirium and dehydration in these patients.
32395966, Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population.
32395966, As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32395966, Protocols for diagnosis, and contact isolation measures, should take these atypical presentations into account.
32395964,COVID-19 is associated with a high prevalence of activation of the coagulation cascade.
32395964, It has been suggested that this so-called COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is predictive of a poor outcome and of mortality.
32395964, Consensus documents on how to manage patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are based on the limited number of mainly retrospective studies that is currently available, and for this reason the recommendations are not always consistent with one another.
32395964, In this article, we review the first studies into COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and give the most important do's and don'ts for diagnostics and the daily management of coagulopathy and the prevention of complications in patients with, or with strongly-suspected, COVID-19 in Dutch clinical practice.
32395897, Here, we review the types, characteristics and shortcomings of various detection methods, as well as perspectives for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
32395897, Clinically, nucleic acid-based methods are sensitive but prone to false-positive.
32395897, The antibody-based method has slightly lower sensitivity but higher accuracy.
32395897, Therefore, it is suggested to combine the two methods to improve the detection accuracy of COVID-19.© 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.
32395850, Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days.
32395850, Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen's Kappa for nominal variables.Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment.
32395850, Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use.Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients.
32395850, Its validation for remote use over the telephone will support staff to monitor clients' risks and outcomes-of particular relevance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in which services are increasingly relying on telework approaches to client monitoring.© 2020 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.

32395788, Fifteen patients received both chloroquine and azithromycin.
32395788, Fourteen patients (70%) were discharged before April, 8, 2020.
32395788, Reported complications were: hypokalemia (3 cases), pulmonary embolism (2 cases) and QT prolongation (1 case).
32395788, One patient died from acute cardiac injury.Knowing the different aspects of moderate and severe forms of the disease can contribute to advance in infection control strategies.
32395720, The two world wars both served to stimulate and change the scope of practice for psychologists.
32395720, We surveyed over 3,000 doctoral psychologists about the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on their clinical practices.
32395720, Practice changed from primarily in-office to mostly telepsychology practice over the course of 2 weeks in March of 2020.

32395673, Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32395673, Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
32395673, This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.
32395673, We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.© 2020 The Author(s).
32395672, Nevertheless, hospitalizations occur and there is a risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32395672, During the COVID-19 pandemic, typical resources used to help manage patients, such as dental services, interventional radiology, rehabilitation and others are limited or not at all available.
32395672, Recognizing the need to provide access to treatment and the anticipated toxicity of such treatment, we have developed and implemented guidelines for clinical care management with the hope of avoiding added risk to our patients.
32395672, If successful, these concepts may be integrated into our care directives in non-pandemic times.© 2020 The Author(s).
32395567, As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered.
32395567, Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms.

32394687, Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic.
32394687, Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provide close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease.
32394687, Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32394687, Herein we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion.
32394605, An online survey was sent to both member and non-member dental schools to investigate the impact on non-clinical and clinical education, assessment and the well-being/pastoral care measures implemented.
32394605, The preliminary findings and discussion are presented in this paper, for the responses collected between the 25th March and 5th April 2020.

32394467, Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV.
32394467, Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms.
32394467, Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids.
32394467, Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

32393664, Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/L), all studies had approximately one-tenth the necessary concentration for in-vitro viral inhibition.
32393664, Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose.We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro.
32393664, Nevertheless, patients receiving hydroxychloroquine long-term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma.
32393664, Because the therapeutic window for hydroxychloroquine in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine.
32393593, Secondary bacterial pneumonia can follow the initial phase of viral respiratory infection or occur during the recovery phase.
32393593, No obvious pattern or guidelines exist for viral coinfection, combined viral and bacterial pneumonia, or secondary bacterial pneumonia in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

32393448, While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG).
32393448, The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind.
32393448, It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain.

32393438, The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify.
32393438, Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type.
32393438, It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.
32393438, The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.© 2020, Zhou et al.
32393419, The novel coronavirus can cause severe respiratory disease and even death.
32393419, However, no specific therapeutic drugs have been developed clinically thus far.
32393419, This article examines the potential of therapeutic drugs by assessing the structure of 2019-nCoV, its mechanism in invading host cells, and the anti-viral mechanism of the human autoimmune system.
32393419, We also review the latest research regarding the progress of potential therapeutic drugs and provide references for new drug developments of COVID-19.
32393325, Preparing intensive care units (ICU) is an integral part of any pandemic response.
32393325, In this review, we discuss the key principles and strategies for ICU preparedness.
32393325, We also describe our initial outbreak measures and share some of the challenges faced.
32393325, To achieve sustainable ICU services, we propose the need to 1) prepare and implement rapid identification and isolation protocols, and a surge in ICU bed capacity; (2) provide a sustainable workforce with a focus on infection control; (3) ensure adequate supplies to equip ICUs and protect healthcare workers; and (4) maintain quality clinical management, as well as effective communication.
32392948, Conclusions: The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and alveolar interstitial syndrome, and may coexist with small range of pulmonary consolidation.
32392948, The sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound is higher than that of chest X-ray and CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, and could be used in monitoring and evaluation of the disease.
32392741, For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined.
32392741, The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS.
32392741, The clotting factors values were compared between the groups.At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs. 455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group.
32392741, The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs. 567 (472.5-644.50); p = 0.0003).Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.
32392591,In December 2019 a novel coronavirus was firstly encountered in Wuhan/China with a massive outbreak of fatal pneumonia leading to a pandemic declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020 (WHO Dashboard COVID-19.

32392562, Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals.
32392562, In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19.

32392559, With a mortality rate of 1-5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of >30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia.
32392559, Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations.

32392473, However, the ability to share these data back to the clinic to inform virtual care and enhance diabetes coaching and guidance remains a challenge.
32392473, In the end, it requires an unnecessarily high level of technical sophistication on the clinic's part and on those living with diabetes to routinely use their diabetes device data in clinic visits, virtual or otherwise.

32392389, One patient with previously stable MG had myasthenic exacerbation.
32392389, One patient treated with tocilizumab for COVID-19 was successfully extubated.
32392389, Two patients were treated for MG with intravenous immunoglobulin without thromboembolic complications.Our findings suggest that the clinical course and outcomes in patients with MG and COVID-19 are highly variable.
32392389, Further large studies are needed to define best practices and determinants of outcomes in this unique population.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32392337, Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted.
32392337, Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission.Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32392337, This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2020.

32392288, At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32392288, The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively.This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults.
32392288, Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children.
32392288, These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.
32392282, The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]).
32392282, In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]).
32392282, In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings.Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
32392282, However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.
32392072, Sequence alignment of six coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%-98.1%) and lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%-77%).
32392072, Thus, a 3D structural model of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures.
32392072, Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2.
32392072, The network of interactions established by these drug molecules affirms their efficacy to inhibit viral RNA replication and provides an insight into their structure-based rational optimization for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.
32392017, Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one.
32392017, Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors.
32392017, However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision.
32392017, Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients.Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.
32392009, The mortality in the ED was 2% and ICU-admission 5%. On March 25th, 2020 the overall mortality was 22% and ICU-admission 15%.We have seen patients with a very serious disease resulting in a high mortality and ICU-admission.
32392009, Over 35% of patient did not have the typical symptoms of fever and respiratory complaints; atypical symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea are frequently seen.
32392009, There is no difference between patients over and under 70 years.
32392009, COVID-19 patients can present with atypical symptoms, co-infections and distributed over various medical specialties.
32391998, Here we present the first Dutch cohort of 29 hospitalized patients during the first two weeks of the epidemic in the Netherlands.
32391998, Demographic characteristics of patients, clinical presentation and course of disease up to the moment of analysis showed similarity with what has been described in Chinese and Italian literature.
32391998, However the higher proportion of patients presenting with gastro-intestinal symptoms and the high number of patients with overweight and obesity stood out.
32391998, Based on the experience in our hospital very early on in the epidemic COVID-19 impresses as a severe illness with risk of acute respiratory deterioration.
32391877, The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.96; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.86; P < 0.001]. The single cut-off point and high level of cTnI predicted risk of in-hospital death, hazard ratio (HR) was 4.56 (95% CI, 1.28-16.28; P = 0.019) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46; P = 0.004), respectively.
32391877, In multivariable logistic regression, senior age, comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high level of C-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury.The risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe COVID-19 can be predicted by markers of myocardial injury, and was significantly associated with senior age, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular comorbidities.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

32391746, No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted.
32391746, Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic.An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs.
32391746, With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs.
32391746, Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.
32391742, Conclusion Bowel abnormalities and cholestasis were common findings on abdominal imaging of inpatients with COVID-19.
32391742, Patients who went to laparotomy often had ischemia, possibly due to small vessel thrombosis.
32391671, The lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage decreased and the inflammatory indicators significantly increased in case 2.
32391671, All patients were treated with antiviral, antitussive, oxygen inhalation; case 3 received glucocorticoids, case 2 with severe illness received glucocorticoids and additionally gamma globulin.
32391671, All three cases were cured and discharged.
32391671, Case 1 with early pregnancy chose to terminate pregnancy after discharge; case 2 chose to continue pregnancy without obstetric complications; and case 3 had cesarean section delivery due to abnormal fetal heart monitoring.The report shows that COVID-19 in pregnancy women could be cured with active treatment, and the maternal and fetal outcomes can be satisfactory.
32391668, On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time.
32391668, On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative.
32391668, On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged.
32391668, At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90.In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.
32391667, The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, P>0.05]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day]. Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations.
32391667, Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P>0.05).The prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good.
32391667, Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32391667, Subsequent research should determine better endpoint and fully consider the feasibility of experiments such as sample size.
32391666, With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
32391666, Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged.
32391666, There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization.
32391666, There were no deaths and no medical staff infections.The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.
32391665,To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis.Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020.
32391665, Their clinical baseline data were collected.
32391665, The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale.
32391665, Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients.Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05).During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.
32391664, No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients.
32391664, The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions.
32391664, CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
32391664, Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.CT images of patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
32391663, Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes.
32391663, During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare,the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation.
32391663, The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission.
32391663, On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%).The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32391662, The results of magnetic bead method for nucleic acid extraction by two different extractors (Sansure Natch CS S12C Fully Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System vs.
32391662, Tianlong NP968-C Nucleic Acid Extractor) were also compared.The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and kappa value were 95.00%, 87.50%, 95.00%, 87.50%and 0.825 for Sansure kit; 90.00%, 87.50%, 94.74%, 77.78%and 0.747 for the Bioperfectus kit, and 82.50%, 81.25%, 91.67%, 65.00%and 0.593 for the BGI kit, respectively.
32391662, The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods were 95.24%, 100.00%, 96.43%and 0.909, respectively, but the one-step cleavage method took only 25 min, while the magnetic bead method required 180 min.
32391662, The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by the two different nucleic acid extractors were 85.00%, 100.00%, 89.29% and 0.764, respectively.The detection efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by the Sansure kit is relatively higher and the one-step cleavage method has advantages of convenient operation and less time consuming.
32391658, We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
32391658, It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32391658, Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
32391658, However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32391657, The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections.
32391657, Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
32391657, The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.
32391657, For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.
32391519, Critically ill women had a high rate of ARDS, and there was one case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy, or maternal mortality.
32391519, Hospitalization for severe or critical COVID-19 infection resulted in delivery during the course of infection in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester.
32391519, There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32391518, For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.5,6Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission.
32391518, Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive.
32391518, In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32391444, Specifically for our radiation oncology department, over 200 patient encounters occur via telemedicine a year.
32391444, Patients report great appreciation and satisfaction with these encounters, as they eliminate the time and energy needed for travel from long distances.
32391444, It has resulted in improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness as well.
32391444, Based on our institutional experience, our long-term vision for telemedicine (after the COVID-19 pandemic has hopefully subsided) is as an excellent and cost-efficient tool to provide long-term follow-up for patients, especially for those who live far away in rural or underserved areas.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.
32391369, Four studies with 542 Chinese participants were included.
32391369, Two studies reported negative findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, i.e., corticosteroids had a detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
32391369, One study reported no significant association between the use of corticosteroids and clinical outcomes.
32391369, However, one study, on 201 participants with different stages of pneumonia due to COVID-19, found that in more severe forms, the administration of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the risk of death by 62%. The literature to date does not fully support the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19, but some findings suggest that methylprednisolone could lower mortality rate in more severe forms of the condition.Copyright © 2020 Veronese, Demurtas, Yang, Tonelli, Barbagallo, Lopalco, Lagolio, Celotto, Pizzol, Zou, Tully, Ilie, Trott, López-Sánchez and Smith.
32391309, Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low.
32391309, This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract.
32391309, However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection.
32391309, Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.Copyright © 2020 Sun, Wang, Liu and Liu.
32391282, In this historical moment, medical oncologists are required to consider the possibility to delay active treatment administration based on a case-by-case risk/benefit evaluation.
32391282, Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment.
32391282, In this study, we report the results of proactive measures including social media, telemedicine, and telephone triage for screening patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy).
32391282, Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 de Marinis, Attili, Morganti, Stati, Spitaleri, Gianoncelli, Del Signore, Catania, Rampinelli, Omodeo Salè, Spaggiari, Mastrilli and Passaro.
32391234, Even though end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and can develop severe to critical disease, there are limited studies and case reports about COVID-19 in ESRD patients.
32391234, We report a case of a 63-year-old gentleman with ESRD on regular hemodialysis.
32391234, We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment.
32391234, He positively responded to a 14-day course of Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Ribavirin, Azithromycin, and Hydroxychloroquine.Copyright © 2020, Alalwan et al.
32390971, In late 2019, the novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing global public health concern.
32390971, In this review, we will summarize the key advancements of current vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as discuss the challenge and opportunity in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis.
32390971, At the end, we advocate the development of a "plug-and-play" platform technologies that could allow quick manufacturing and administration of broad-spectrum countermeasures in an outbreak setting.
32390971, We will discuss the potential of AAV-based gene therapy technology for in vivo therapeutic antibody delivery to combat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the future emergence of severe CoVs.Copyright © 2020 Tse, Meganck, Graham and Baric.
32390495,The recommendations recently proposed by the European and American Vascular Societies in this new 'Covid-19' era regarding the triage of various vascular operations into urgent, emergent and programmed based on the nature of their pathology aim at reserving health care expenses and hospital staff towards managing the current unexpected worldwide pandemic to the highest possible degree.
32390495, The suggestion for implementation of these changes into real-world practice, however, does not come without a cost.
32390495, In particular, the recommendation for deferral of access creation in pre-dialysis patients, ethical, socio-economic and medico-legal issues arise which should be seriously taken into consideration.
32390495, At the end of the day, vascular access creation is the lifeline of haemodialysis patients and the indication for surgery warrants patient-specific clinical judgement rather than 'group labelling'.
32390367, Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%).
32390367, In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%).
32390367, Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients.
32390367, As of March 29, 2020, the mortality rate was 5.1%. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients in South Korea up to March 29, 2020.© Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2020.
32390285, Of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, 196/429 (46%) had comorbidities.
32390285, Risk factors for COVID-19 were identified in 4/4 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 47/429 (11%) SARS-CoV-2 negative patients.Our study identified a very low rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in children presenting to a tertiary ED or RIC, none of whom were admitted to hospital.

32389499, The aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and by acquired immune system impairment (immune senescence).
32389499, Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging.
32389499, The high mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that clarification of the mechanisms of inflamm-aging and immune senescence can help combat not only age-related disorders but also SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32389148, Moreover, internet addiction was associated with elevated risks of distress (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.60-2.64) and probable ASR (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.50-3.10).
32389148, By contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55) and probable ASR (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69).
32389148, All associations were independent of baseline psychological distress.Our findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students.

32389027, Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay (LOS) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3 days, P < .001).Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently.
32389027, These COVID-19 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a longer LOS and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia.
32389027, Patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate.
32389027, We recommend health systems which ensure that inpatient hyperglycemia is safely and effectively treated.
32388947, Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32388947, Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative.
32388947, In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic.
32388947, Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.
32388937, Conclusions: No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.
32388937, Furthermore, the combination usage of LPV/r and arbidol may not benefit for improving the disease.
32388937, Noteworthy, the adverse reactions of the antiviral drugs should be paid careful attention during the treatment.

32388805,In the current dismal situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective management of patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome is of vital importance.
32388805, Due to the current lack of effective pharmacological concepts, this situation has caused interest in (re)considering historical reports on the treatment of patients with low-dose radiation therapy for pneumonia.
32388805, Although these historical reports are of low-level evidence per se, hampering recommendations for decision-making in the clinical setting, they indicate effectiveness in the dose range between 0.3 and 1 Gy, similar to more recent dose concepts in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory/degenerative benign diseases with, e.g., a single dose per fraction of 0.5 Gy.
32388805, This concise review aims to critically review the evidence for low-dose radiation treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy and discuss whether it is worth investigating in the present clinical situation.
32388722, Moreover, child's will must not be forced.Conclusion: On the basis of clinical findings, we think that the universal use of facial masks seems necessary when people have to go out in their everyday lives.
32388722, In addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face, it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work and school lessons on this issue and other hygiene topics with the main aim to obtain child cooperation.What is Known:• Asymptomatic people can transmit and become important sources of COVID-19.• Asymptomatic cases are common also in pediatrics.What is New:• Universal use of face masks for success against COVID-19 seems necessary also in pediatric age when people have to go out in their everyday lives.• In addition to the availability of masks of different sizes capable of adapting perfectly to the face, it is necessary that the use of masks in children is preceded by a strong parental work and school lessons with the main aim to obtain child cooperation.

32387470,The severe form of COVID-19 share several clinical and laboratory features with four entities gathered under the term "hyperferritinemic syndromes" and including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS) and septic shock.
32387470, COVID-19 systemic inflammatory reaction and "hyperferritinemic syndromes" are all characterized by high serum ferritin and a life-threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure.
32387470, In this review, we analyze the possible epidemiological and molecular mechanisms responsible for hyper-inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and we underline the similarities between this condition and "hyperferritinemic syndromes" which would allow considering severe COVID-19 as a fifth member of this spectrum of inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32386514, The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses.
32386514, Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality.
32386514, A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed.
32386514, This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.PROSPERO CRD42020178787.
32386460, Skin biopsies obtained in six patients were consistent with chilblains.
32386460, On follow-up, all cases showed spontaneous marked improvement or complete healing.Acute chilblains were observed during COVID-19 pandemic in children and teenagers.
32386460, It is a mildly symptomatic condition with an excellent prognosis, usually requiring no therapy.
32386460, Etiopathogenesis remains unknown.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32386285, All three healthcare professionals who presented with loss of sense of smell subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32386285, Psychophysical testing of olfaction using the UPSIT confirmed mild and moderate microsmia in two, respectively, and normosmia at day 17 in one.Olfactory (± gustatory) dysfunction is indicative of COVID-19 infection and thus has important implications in the context of healthcare workers, or key workers in general, who work in close contact with others if not recognised as suffering from COVID.
32386285, This leads to a potentially higher likelihood of spreading the virus.
32386285, In conjunction with our literature review these findings have helped with creating recommendations on the assessment and management of olfactory dysfunction during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both for healthcare workers and patients.
32386057,The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has placed immense pressure on supply chains, including shortages in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.
32386057, Here, we report our experience of using 3D-printing to rapidly develop and deploy custom-made NP swabs to address supply shortages at our healthcare institution.© American Society for Clinical Pathology 2020.

32386019, A total of 5 patients from one family, including 4 adults and 1 child, had a history of human contact in Wuhan, Hubei.
32386019, Four adult patients showed different symptoms, including cough, fever, pharyngeal pain, and dyspnea, while the child patient had no symptoms.
32386019, Laboratory examination showed no abnormality in all the patients except for slight increase in CRP in 2 patients and mild abnormal liver function index in 1 patient.
32386019, The chest CT showed that all patients had abnormal images, with different degrees of manifestations.All patients were finally diagnosed by the nucleic acid test.
32386017, Multiple lesions were found in 71.17% patients and multiple lobules in 86.50% patients.
32386017, Lesions in 53.37% patients were found with bronchial inflation signs and those in 36.20% patients presented with "crazy paving" pattern, while only 7.36% were found with hilar node enlargement and pleural effusion.
32386017, First CT findings of 18 patients were found to be inconsistent with the results of pathogen examination.COVID-19 patients showed specific features in the first chest CT examination.
32386017, The combination of the first chest CT imaging features and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results as well as reexamination if necessary can help to make the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection accurately.
32386015, The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P< 0.01).Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics.
32386015, The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT.
32386015, Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes.
32386015, Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.
32386014, Among the 26 cases of "wrinkling shape" lesions in the second CT examination, except for 11 cases without reexamination, the other 15 patients had different degrees of absorption in the third CT examination.The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule.
32386014, As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion.
32386014, When the lesions show a "wrinkling shape", it is often suggested that the lesions will evolve towards the direction of absorption.
32386014, These characteristics are of great value in assisting clinical diagnosis and dynamically observing changes undersuch condition.
32386013, Three patients were reported with negative results in the initial and follow-up CT examination.
32386013, One patient was reported with initial negative CT findings but turning positive during the first follow-up.
32386013, All patients had absorbed lesions on follow-up CT images after treatment.Pediatric COVID-19 patients have certain imaging and clinical features as well as disease prognosis.
32386013, Children with COVID-19 tend to have normal or subtle CT findings and relatively better outcome.
32386012, The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested.There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination.
32386012, Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19.
32386012, The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign.
32386012, In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942.The standardized imaging diagnosis report mode based on COVID-19 chest image features is effective and practical, which should be popularized.
32386011, Chest imaging examination is an important auxiliary examination method in diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386011, To further standardize the imaging examination and diagnosis of COVID-19, Hunan Society of Radiology together with Imaging Technology Professional Committee of Hunan Medical Association reach an expert consensus document on imaging examination, diagnosis, and control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19.
32386011, This document summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging examination procedure, imaging findings, CT staging, the value of imaging examination, and the methods for control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19 during imaging examination.
32386011, Furthermore, it extends the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in children.
32385900, Survey invitations were sent to editorial board members of eating disorders journals, members of eating disorder scientific organizations (e.g., Eating Disorders Research Society), and individuals who provided at least three IJED reviews in the prior 12 months.
32385900, We reviewed the responses of 187 participants and identified three categories of changes that: (a) had already been implemented by the journal, (b) cannot be implemented because they fall outside the scope of IJED, or (c) will be implemented in coming weeks or months.
32385900, The latter category includes publishing topical COVID-19 papers, making some COVID-19-related content available open access, revising statistical guidelines, and issuing author guidance on reporting protocol changes caused by COVID-19-related disruptions.
32385900, IJED recognizes the disruptive impacts that COVID-19 has on all activities in our field, including clinical work, teaching, and advocacy, and is committed to supporting authors during this difficult time while striving to publish high-quality research.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32385858, Recent articles also report targetoid lesions in exanthems of patients with COVID-19 infection.9,10 In addition, the presence of pseudo-vesicles and enanthem are two clues that suggest an infectious cause rather than a drug reaction.
32385858, However, we cannot positively exclude the involvement of the various drugs administered to the patients.
32385858, This is a first observation that will require further investigations.This article is protected by copyright.

32385829, All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician's responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements.
32385829, There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice.There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive.
32385829, Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational.
32385829, Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.
32385712, Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation.
32385712, While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on "anti-viral" and "anti-inflammatory" strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue.
32385712, Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression.
32385712, Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.
32385672, Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy.
32385672, Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease.
32385672, In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.
32385672, Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic.
32385648, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively.
32385648, CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation.There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation.
32385648, An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes.
32385648, Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis.• The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions. • An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome. • Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.
32385628, In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence.
32385628, Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.
32385614,The novel coronavirus pandemic has drastically affected healthcare organizations across the globe.We sought to summarize the current telemedicine environment in order to highlight the important changes triggered by the novel coronavirus pandemic, as well as highlight how the current crisis may inform the future of telemedicine.At many institutions, the number of telemedicine visits dramatically increased within days following the institution of novel coronavirus pandemic restrictions on in-person clinical encounters.
32385614, Prior to the pandemic, telemedicine utilization was weak throughout surgical specialties due to regulatory and reimbursement barriers.
32385614, As part of the pandemic response, the USA government temporarily relaxed various telemedicine restrictions and provided additional telemedicine funding.The post-pandemic role of telemedicine is dependent on permanent regulatory solutions.
32385614, In the coming decade, telemedicine and telesurgery are anticipated to mature due to the proliferation of interconnected consumer health devices and high-speed 5G data connectivity.
32385130, The most common finding on chest computed tomography (CT) was ground-grass or patchy opacity (82.1%).
32385130, After initiating comprehensive interventions-including entrance screening of body temperature and symptoms, universal chest CT and blood tests, and other measures-new patients presenting with COVID-19 peaked at 10 per day on January 30, decreasing to 4 per day on February 11.
32385130, No new cases occurred between February 26 and March 10, 2020.We found that patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were susceptible to COVID-19 and that hemodialysis centers were high-risk settings during the epidemic.
32385130, Increasing prevention efforts, instituting universal screening, and isolating patients with COVID-19 and directing them to designated hemodialysis centers were effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers.Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.
32384798, These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research.
32384798, Controlled clinical trials are needed.
32384397, Levels of inflammation bio-makers such as hsCRP, IL-6, IL-10 and D-dimer elevated in severe children compared with non-severe children on admission.
32384397, The level of total bilirubin and uric acid clearly elevated in severe children compared with non-severe children on admission.
32384397, All of severe children displayed the lesions on chest CT, more lung segments were involved in severe children than in non-severe children, which was only risk factor associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in multivariable analysis.More than 3 lung segments involved were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19 in children.
32384397, Moreover, the possible risk of the elevation of IL-6, high total bilirubin and D-dimer with univariable analysis could identify patients to be severe earlier.
32384251, COVID-19 requires scaled interactions with populations in near real-time.
32384251, Remote monitoring has specific operational and design features that are well suited for the COVID-19, especially the asynchronous communication.
32384251, Monitoring can be used in particular to gather pandemic data and obtain real-time clinical feedback.
32384251, As telemedicine continues to grow and evolve, remote monitoring is emerging as a valuable tool for payers, providers, and public health officials alike.
32384180, Out of all, 19 patients (79.2%) presented the skin rash after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.
32384180, Histologic examination in two patients was consistent with viral infection, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in four patients.
32384180, This monocentric study shows the clinical characteristics of vesicular skin rashes in COVID-19 patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32384153, To validate the assay against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total viral RNA derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 positive and 11 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were screened.
32384153, All results were compared to established RT-qPCR assays.The 95% detection probability of the RT-RPA assay was determined to be 7.74 (95% CI: 2.87 - 27.39) RNA copies per reaction.
32384153, The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance.
32384153, The developed RT-RPA assay produced 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to RT-qPCR (n=20).With a run time of 15 to 20 minutes and first results being available in under 7 minutes for high RNA concentrations, the reported assay constitutes one of the fastest nucleic acid based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to date and may provide a simple to use alternative to RT-qPCR for first-line screening at the point of need.© 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
32384078, At the onset of illness, the common symptoms were fever (156 [77.2%]) and cough (120 [59.4%]). 66 (32.7%) patients had lymphopenia. 193 (95.5%) patients had abnormal radiological findings. 11 (5.4%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and none of the patients died. 23 (11.4%) patients had severe illness.
32384078, Severe illness of COVID-19 was independently associated with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR], 9.219; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.731 to 31.126; P<0.001) and a known history of type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.326; 95% CI, 1.059 to 17.668; P = 0.041).
32384078, In this case series in Jiangsu Province, COVID-19 patients had less severe symptoms and had better outcomes than the initial COVID-19 patients in Wuhan.
32384078, The BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 and a known history of type 2 diabetes were independent risk factors of severe illness in patients with COVID-19.
32383963, A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy has been carried out.
32383963, Scientific papers currently available via the PubMed NCBI search engine on COVID-19 postmortem diagnosis were also examined.
32383963, Discussion: Throughout the history of medicine, the role of autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated postmortem through autopsy.
32383963, The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.
32383809, White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (P = .052).
32383809, The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913.
32383809, Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women.Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
32383809, Stringent monitoring and early intervention are needed to reduce mortality in these patients.© 2020 The American Geriatrics Society.
32383763, Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease compared with the others (36% vs. 15%, log-rank P = 0.019; relative risk 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.08-5.09).
32383763, The rate of thrombo-embolic events and septic shock during the hospitalization was also higher in cardiac patients (23% vs. 6% and 11% vs. 0%, respectively).Hospitalized patients with concomitant cardiac disease and COVID-19 have an extremely poor prognosis compared with subjects without a history of cardiac disease, with higher mortality, thrombo-embolic events, and septic shock rates.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

32383624, This might be due to the fact that ACE2 is the receptor for the virus to enter human cells, but, on the contrary, that ACE2 expression is downregulated following SARS-1 infection, resulting in disproportionate activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and exacerbated pneumonia progression.
32383624, However, no solid clinical data are available at the present moment to support or disprove such hypotheses.
32383624, We announce in this letter that a large multicentre case-control study has been started in Italy that is the country with a very high impact of COVID-19 infection.
32383624, We hope that our letter will encourage other clinical centres, even outside Italy, to join our study.
32383530, After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians.A range of themes emerged from the online discussion.
32383530, A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods.Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence-based practice.
32383530, These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.© 2020 The Authors.

32383254, Positive, borderline, and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different methods of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer).
32383254, Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner.
32383254, Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.© 2020 The Authors.

32383239, Sharing clinical experiences is therefore of enormous importance.
32383239, Actually, information about the care given in the Covid-19 ward (in contrast to that provided in the Emergency Room/ICU) is still sparse.
32383239, The last weeks we built experience and gathered knowledge while giving hospital care to patients who had a pre-existent endocrine disease (and diabetes; most patients suffered from a type two diabetes).
32383239, In our contribution we presented our insights obtained from this intensive period obtained in the Covid-19 ward.© 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.
32383183, Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general, and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients.
32383183, In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody.
32383183, In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase.
32383183, Our study identified a discrepancy in the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in male and female patients, which may be a potential cause leading to a different outcome of Coronavirus Disease 2019 between sex.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32383179, The cobas SARS-CoV-2 test reported 706 positive and 300 negative results.
32383179, The LDT reported 640 positive, 323 negative, 34 inconclusive, and 9 invalid results.
32383179, When excluding inconclusive and invalid results, the overall percent agreement between the two platforms was 95.8%. Cohen's κ coefficient was 0.904 (95% confidence interval, 0.875-0.933), suggesting almost perfect agreement between both platforms.
32383179, An overall discordance rate of 4.2% between the two systems may reflect differences in primer sequences, assay limit of detection, or other factors, highlighting the importance of comparing the performance of different testing platforms.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32383125, The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death).
32383125, Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States.These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic.
32383125, In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.
32383125, Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04308668); registered 16 March, 2020.
32382873, Currently, there is still no licensed specific antiviral treatment for the human coronavirus disease and a vaccine will not be ready soon.
32382873, However, based on experience from the use of other antiviral agents to treat similar virusses, some treatment options have been tried with some efficacy.
32382873, Clinical trials for future therapies are still ongoing.
32382873, In the meantime, prevention, control, active communication and investment in research are the only ways to overcome this challenge.
32382748, We then define key hypotheses and areas for future research that can use the pediatric model of disease, transmission, and immunity to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for people of all age groups.© The Author(s) 2020.

32382449, In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.
32382449, The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.© 2020 THE AUTHORS.

32382418, This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases.
32382418, The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ.
32382418, A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course.Quantitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 quantitatively has potential significance for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.© 2020 The Authors.

32382213, These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety.
32382213, These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks.
32382213, Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32382146, Compared with the lung A549 cells, similar expression was noted in conjunctival and pterygium cells.
32382146, In addition, mouse cornea had comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene and lower but prominent Ace2 gene expression compared with the lung tissue.Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32382146, With high and consistent expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in cornea, cornea rather than conjunctiva has higher potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32382146, Precaution is necessary to prevent possible SARS-CoV-2 infection through ocular surface in clinical practice.
32381643, Cohen's kappa analysis rated the strength of agreement between the two platforms as "almost perfect" (κ = 0.922; standard error, 0.051).
32381643, Furthermore, there was no significant difference between corresponding cycle threshold values generated on the two systems (P value = 0.88; Student's t test).
32381643, Taken together, these data imply both platforms can be considered comparable in terms of their clinical performance.
32381643, We believe this information will be useful for those who have already adopted these platforms or are seeking to implement high-throughput RT-PCR testing to stem the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32381642, In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA.
32381642, Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting.
32381642, Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests.
32381642, Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32381430, Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet.
32381430, Skin lesion development occurred before the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days.
32381430, Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions.Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.Copyright © 2020.

32381426, In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
32381426, At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were still hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.

32381073, The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms.The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild.
32381073, Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease.
32381073, The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms.
32381073, This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.
32381057, Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used.
32381057, The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19).Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05).
32381057, The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854.
32381057, These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score >  2.With a simple and practical scoring system based on CT imaging features, we can make a hierarchical diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 with different management suggestions.
32380908, In conclusion, owing to its safety profile, capacity to restore oxygenation, downregulate cytokine storm, and reconstitute immunity, ExoFlo is a promising therapeutic candidate for severe COVID-19.
32380908, Future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine ExoFlo therapeutic potential.
32380510, The Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 of 25 Malayan pangolins analyzed.
32380510, Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against Pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
32380510, The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins suggests that they have the potential to act as the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
32380510, The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.
32380501, This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research.
32380501, Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) - a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellence - during the COVID-19 crisis.

32380430, None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
32380430, Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients.
32380430, Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as 'One Community' working for 'One Health's.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32379882, The impact on pain management fellowships has been significant and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows.
32379882, Several strategies will help address these challenges, including employing telehealth capabilities to continue clinical experiences, and providing trainees with opportunities to continue their professional growth beyond fellowship completion.
32379882, Together, we can implement innovative solutions to overcome these challenges.© The Author(s) 2020.

32379863, Metagenomic sequencing offers the promise of unbiased detection of emerging pathogens, without requiring prior knowledge of the identity of the responsible agent or its genomic sequence.To evaluate metagenomic approaches in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, laboratory-confirmed positive and negative samples from Seattle, Washington were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing, with comparison to a 2019 reference genomic database created before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.Within 36 hours our results showed clear identification of a novel human Betacoronavirus, closely related to known Betacoronaviruses of bats, in laboratory-proven cases of SARS-CoV-2.
32379863, A subset of samples also showed superinfection or colonization with human parainfluenza virus 3 or Moraxella species, highlighting the need to test directly for SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to ruling out an infection using a viral respiratory panel.
32379863, Samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were also negative by metagenomic analysis, and positive for Rhinovirus A and C.
32379863, Unlike targeted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR testing, metagenomic analysis of these SARS-CoV-2 negative samples identified candidate etiological agents for the patients' respiratory symptoms.Taken together, these results demonstrate the value of metagenomic analysis in the monitoring and response to this and future viral pandemics.© 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.
32379729, The proportion of hospitalized patients who were black was higher than expected based on overall hospital admissions.
32379729, In an adjusted time-to-event analysis, black patients were not more likely than were nonblack patients to receive invasive mechanical ventilation† (IMV) or to die during hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-1.13).
32379729, Given the overrepresentation of black patients within this hospitalized cohort, it is important for public health officials to ensure that prevention activities prioritize communities and racial/ethnic groups most affected by COVID-19.
32379729, Clinicians and public officials should be aware that all adults, regardless of underlying conditions or age, are at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.
32379699, We highlight the need for education (sick day rules, stringent social distancing rules), equipment (sufficient glucocorticoid supplies, steroid emergency self-injection kit) and empowerment (steroid emergency card, COVID-19 guidelines) to prevent adrenal crises.
32379699, In patients with adrenal insufficiency developing an acute COVID-19 infection, which frequently presents with continuous high fever, we suggest oral stress dose cover with 20mg hydrocortisone every six hours.
32379699, We also comment on suggested dosing for patients who usually take modified release hydrocortisone or prednisolone.
32379699, In patients with clinical insufficiency showing clinical deterioration during an acute COVID-19 infection, we advise immediate (self-)injection of 100mg hydrocortisone intramuscularly, followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 200mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours, or until this can be established, administration of 50mg hydrocortisone every 6 hours.
32379692,A new kind of Pneumonia caused by new corona virus has been widespread in China since winter of 2019.
32379692, No effective treatment for this disease was verified, so the morbidity and mortality rate were supposed higher than flu.

32379667, Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality.
32379667, Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software.The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
32379667, The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P < 0.001).Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32379199, The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection.The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.
32379199, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children.
32379199, The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.
32379199, The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.
32379191, This period was shorter in asymptomatic patients (26.4%) compared with symptomatic patients (73.6%) (11 days vs. 17 days).
32379191, Multivariable regression analysis showed increased odds of symptomatic infection was associated with age <6 years (odds ratio [OR] 8.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.55-31.35; P = 0.001), hypersensitive C-reactive protein >3.0 mg/L (OR 4.89; 95% CI: 1.10-21.75; P = 0.037) and presenting pneumonia in chest radiologic findings (OR 8.45; 95% CI: 2.69-26.61; P < 0.001).
32379191, Kaplan-Meier analysis displayed symptomatic infection (P < 0.001), fever (P = 0.006), pneumonia (P = 0.003) and lymphocyte counts <2.0 × 10/L (P = 0.008) in children with COVID-19 were associated with prolonged duration of viral shedding in children with COVID-19.Prolonged duration of viral shedding in children with COVID-19 was associated with symptomatic infection, fever, pneumonia and lymphocyte count =2.0 × 10/L.
32379191, Monitoring of symptoms could help to know the viral shedding in children with COVID-19.
32379114, The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32379114, This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32379114, Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.Prognostic Level IV.
32379114, See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32379070, Access to contact information, Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram handles were noted.35% of sovereign states had plastic surgery society websites. 22% of national society websites had a specific COVID-19 section. 14/15 (93%) of these websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines available for health care professionals.COVID-19 information provided by national plastic surgery society websites is sparse.
32379070, Two-thirds of national plastic surgery societies do not have a web presence.
32379070, The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is limited.
32379070, This study suggests that improvement and increase in COVID-19 information provided by many national plastic surgery society websites is needed.
32379056, Minimally invasive CRC surgery combined with a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery should be recommended.
32379056, We also focus on mental health treatments and healthy lifestyle education.
32379056, In addition, routine follow-up can be moderately delayed.
32379056, In total, adequate doctor-patient communication is also recommended throughout the treatment.
32378844, Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3).
32378844, Only one of the most severely ill patients scored ≥ 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission.Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms.
32378844, A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness.
32378844, A NEWS2 score of ≥ 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score ≥ 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.
32378815, The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population.
32378815, The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated.
32378815, The mortality rate was 3.1.COVID-19 patients present a challenge for healthcare professionals and the whole medical system.
32378815, We hope our findings will assist other providers and institutions in their care for these patients.
32378805, There have already been examples of self-medication and overdose.
32378805, Clearly, there is a need to further define the efficacy of treatments used in the management of COVID-19.
32378805, This evidence needs to be backed by large randomised-controlled clinical trials.
32378805, In the meantime, there will no doubt be further off-label use of these medications by patients and practitioners and possibly related toxicity.© 2020 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine.
32378801, Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous.
32378801, Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow.
32378801, Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas.
32378801, In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32378797, Overseas travel or known contact with a confirmed case was reported by 24 (14%) and 16 (10%) patients, respectively.
32378797, Fever or hypoxia was recorded in 23 (10%) and 11 (5%) patients, respectively.
32378797, Eleven (5%) patients received mechanical ventilation in the ED, of whom none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Among patients presenting to a tertiary ED with suspected COVID-19, only a small proportion tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

32378705, Out of the two isolates, one was found to harbor a mutation in its receptor-binding domain (RBD) at position 407.
32378705, At this site, arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-β branched amino acid).
32378705, This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor binding of the virus.
32378705, Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.© 2020 The Author(s).
32378648,The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across China and worldwide.
32378648, Remdesivir had been proposed as a promising option for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32378648, We provided a rapid review to critically assess the potential anti-coronavirus effect of remdesivir on COVID-19 and other coronaviruses based on the most up-to-date evidence.
32378648, Even though remdesivir was proposed as a promising option for treating COVID-19 based on laboratory experiments and reports from compassionate use, its safety and effect in humans requires high-quality evidence from well-designed and adequately-powered clinical trials for further clarification.
32378471, Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies.
32378471, The animal models are important for both the fundamental research and drug discovery of coronavirus.
32378471, This review aims to summarize the animal models currently available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their potential use for the study of SARS-CoV-2.
32378471, We will discuss the benefits and caveats of these animal models and present critical findings that might guide the fundamental studies and urgent treatment of SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.
32378464,Observation of infection trends through the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has indicated that those with certain pre-existing chronic conditions, such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity, are particularly likely to develop severe infection and experience disastrous sequelae, including near-fatal pneumonia.
32378464, This article aims to outline how SARS-CoV-2 affects people and to consider why individuals living with long-term conditions are at increased risk from infection caused by this virus.
32378464, A summary of available clinical guidelines with recommendations is presented, to provide community nurses with the up-to-date information required for protecting individuals living with a number of long-term conditions.
32378464, Additionally, special measures required are outlined, so that community nurses may reflect on how to best provide nursing care for individuals living with long-term conditions and understand protection measures for individuals at increased risk from severe COVID-19.
32378325, Overall, all centers remained open although a reduction in the activity was noted.
32378325, Transplant Programs reduced their outpatient activity both in terms of pre-transplant evaluation (68% of the centers) and transplant recipient follow-up (100%); a reduction in transplant activity was observed in the first two weeks of March only in the north-central macro area (23 LTs vs 39 in 2018 and 60 in 2019); overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection was registered for 24 liver transplant recipients and 37 health care providers in liver transplant units.
32378325, In the perspective of the increasing magnitude of the epidemic, more data will be required to define appropriate strategies for the increasingly complex management of liver transplant patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32378314, Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started.
32378314, Because of a lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated.
32378314, The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home.

32378252, However, there remain significant variations between England regions.
32378252, Regression analysis across UTLAs found that the only factor relating to reduction in ADIR was the historic number of confirmed number infection/000 population, There is, however, wide variation between Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLA) areas.
32378252, Extrapolation of these results showed that unreported community infection may be 150 times higher than reported cases, providing evidence that by the end of the 2nd week in April, 26.8% of the population may already have had the disease and so have increased immunity.Analysis of current case data using infectious ratio has provided novel insight into the current national state and can be used to make better-informed decisions about future management of restricted social behaviour and movement.© 2020 The Authors.

32377709, Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative prognosis for the obese patients.
32377709, A growing body of evidence connects obesity with COVID‑19 and a number of mechanisms from immune system activity attenuation to chronic inflammation are implicated.
32377709, Lipid peroxidation creates reactive lipid aldehydes which in a patient with metabolic disorder and COVID‑19 will affect its prognosis.
32377709, Finally, pregnancy‑associated obesity needs to be studied further in connection to COVID‑19 as this infection could pose high risk both to pregnant women and the fetus.
32377694, Since then, worldwide research has focused on obtaining a vaccine.
32377694, This has a major economic impact because new technological platforms and advanced genetic engineering procedures are required to obtain a COVID‑19 vaccine.
32377694, The most difficult scientific challenge for this future vaccine obtained in the laboratory is the proof of clinical safety and efficacy.
32377694, The biggest challenge of manufacturing is the construction and validation of production platforms capable of making the vaccine on a large scale.

32377638, In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.
32377638, Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.
32377638, Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.
32377638, Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Xinhui Wang et al.
32377597, Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19.
32377597, Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization.
32377597, Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field.As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
32377597, We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.© 2020 The Author(s).
32377596, Infection rates and quarantine were quite low amongst staff and patients.
32377596, The majority of residents were deployed into COVID-19 clinical settings.While "planning for the worst", our health system was able to make necessary changes to still function at a reduced capacity.

32377559, As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered.
32377559, Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate.
32377559, An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.

32377468, She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
32377468, Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults.
32377468, The patient likely contracted the virus from her parents, who because of the fear of social stigma hide recent history of respiratory illness.

32376700, The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], ±1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, ±3.70%).IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds.
32376700, This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds.
32376700, These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations.
32376700, Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.Copyright © 2020 Mora-Díaz et al.

32376593, Heat inactivation of the samples was carried out at 56 ℃ for 30 min followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile or ethanol.
32376593, The plasma standard and quality control samples were inactivated in an identical manner and tested with LC-MS/MS along with the treated samples.The optimized method showed a high imprecision (with mean intra- and inter-day imprecisions of 3.59% and 2.81%, respectively) and a high accuracy (mean 97.37%) for detecting voriconazole in the inactivated samples at different concentration levels.
32376593, Sample preparation with acetonitrile or ethanol resulted in a high mean recovery (100.56% or 95.90%) with minimal mean matrix effect (102.85% or 93.62%).
32376593, The measured voriconazole concentrations in inactivated whole blood, inactivated plasma and the samples without inactivation all showed good linear correlations with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99.Heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min combined with ethanol sample preparation only has limited effects to affect LC-MS-based voriconazole concentration measurement in whole blood samples collected in heparinized tubes, and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32376592, Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation.
32376592, A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far.For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality.
32376592, Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety.
32376592, The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.
32376589, The CT scores of the lower lobes were significantly higher compared with those of the middle/upper lobes (P < 0.05) in stage 3 and stage 4.ConclusionChest CT scans allows dynamic monitoring of the changes in the distribution, density and extent of the pulmonary lesions in the 4 stages, which are closely correlated with the evolution of the disease course of COVID-19.
32376587, The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures.
32376587, The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies.
32376587, Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks.
32376587, We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.
32376581, Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19.
32376581, The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19.The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05).
32376581, The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05).
32376581, Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.An increased NLR can serve as an early warning signal of severe COVID-19.
32376573, Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea.
32376573, Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments.
32376573, Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (P < 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (P < 0.05).
32376573, The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05).MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.

32376395, Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32376395, Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications.
32376395, Within our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01-1.21%), comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% (0.20-0.21%), p = .597].Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32376308, Mean difference (MD) of lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of lymphopenia for severe form of COVID-19 was evaluated with this meta-analysis.Overall 13 case-series with a total of 2282 cases were included in the study.
32376308, The pooled analysis showed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients (MD -0.31×109/L; 95%CI: -0.42 to -0.19×109/L).
32376308, The presence of lymphopenia was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of severe COVID-19 (Random effects model, OR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.31-6.82).Lymphopenia is a prominent part of severe COVID-19 and a lymphocyte count of less than 1.5×109/L may be useful in predicting the severity clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32375909, According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the gender, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases, and other data of the patients, and carried out analyses and discussion.In total, 50 fatal cases were reported: median age was 70 y old, and males were 2.33 times more likely to die than females.
32375909, The median number of days from the first symptom to death was 13, and that length of time tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and older compared with those younger than 65 (12 days vs 17 days; P = 0.046).
32375909, Therefore, the older patients had fewer number of days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40; P = 0.012).In our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progression to death time was shorter.
32375909, At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.
32375845, The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure.
32375845, Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important.
32375845, The effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients were uncertain.
32375845, We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.
32375488,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is to date affecting more than a million of patients and is challenging healthcare professionals around the world.
32375488, Coronavirus disease 2019 may present with a wide range of clinical spectrum and severity, including severe interstitial pneumonia with high prevalence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care admission.
32375488, There has been increasing sharing experience regarding the patient's clinical features over the last weeks which has underlined the need for general guidance on treatment strategies.
32375488, We summarise the evidence existing in the literature of oxygen and positive pressure treatments in patients at different stages of respiratory failure and over the course of the disease, including environment and ethical issues related to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 infection.
32375201, This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel and geographically agnostic framework (the 4Ps framework) to guide multidisciplinary, scalable, resource-efficient, and achievable efforts toward enhanced testing capacity.
32375201, The 4Ps (Prioritize, Propagate, Partition, and Provide) are described in terms of specific opportunities to enhance the volume, diversity, characterization, and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 testing to benefit public health.
32375201, Coordinated deployment of the strategic and tactical recommendations described in this framework has the potential to rapidly expand available testing capacity, improve public health decision-making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or to be applied in future emergent disease outbreaks.© 2020 The Authors.

32374289, We answered this question using the conceptual tools of professional ethics in obstetrics, especially the professional virtue of integrity.
32374289, A public health emergency requires frameshifting from an individual-patient perspective to a population-based perspective.
32374289, We show that an individual-patient-based, beneficence-based deliberative clinical judgment is not an adequate basis for organizational policy in response to a public health emergency.
32374289, Instead, physicians, especially those in leadership positions, must frameshift to population-based clinical ethical judgment that focuses on reduction of mortality as much as possible in the entire population of patients served by a healthcare organization.
32374264, This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19.
32374264, Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course.

32374248, Significant differences were observed among groups of different clinical stages in numbers of influenced pulmonary segments (6 vs. 12 vs. 17, P < 0.001).
32374248, A significantly upward trend was witnessed in ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows (33% vs. 42% vs. 55% vs. 80%, P < 0.001), while pure ground-glass opacities gradually decreased as disease progressed (45% vs. 35% vs. 24% vs. 13%, P < 0.001) within 12 days.
32374248, Lymphocytes, prealbumin and albumin showed a downtrend as disease progressed from mild to severe or critical condition, an uptrend was found in white blood cells, C-reactive protein, neutrophils and lactate dehydrogenase.
32374248, The proportions of serum amyloid A > 300 mg/l in mild, severe and critical conditions were 18%, 46% and 71%, respectively.
32374074, Structure-based virtual screenings were performed using the ChEMBL database.
32374074, Through a total of 1 485 144 screenings, 64 potential drugs (11 approved, 14 clinical, and 39 preclinical drugs) were predicted to show high binding affinity with Mpro . Additional docking simulations for predicted compounds with high binding affinity with Mpro suggested that 28 bioactive compounds may have potential as effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.

32374001, As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
32374001, We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
32374001, All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
32373999, Many efforts have been applied to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and many scientific studies have been conducted in a short period of time.
32373999, Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32373999, Current researches on potentially effective treatment alternatives are discussed.
32373999, We hope this review can help medical workers and researchers around the world contain the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32373998, Recently, WHO has defined COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and considerable researches have focused on the identification and prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
32373998, As a result, accumulated publications successively reported their early findings, leading to the constant updating of information, which might make confusion for readers.
32373998, Therefore, this review summarized the current researches about the genomic evolution, variation of SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrated its viral structure for pathogenesis.
32373998, Meanwhile, we analyzed the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide recommendations for present clinical treatments and inspirations for potential therapy options.
32373993, We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro.
32373993, The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.
32373993, People are currently using these drugs for malaria.
32373993, It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.
32373992, SARS-Cov-2 has a strong infection, and the mortality rate of severe patients after infection is high, but there is no effective treatment.
32373992, Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions, which can reduce the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32373992, At the same time, MSCs can reduce the level of pulmonary fibrosis and enhance tissue injury repair.
32373992, In this short report, combined with the progress of preclinical and clinical research, we comment the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19.
32373990, This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19.
32373990, The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes.
32373990, A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion.
32373990, Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.
32373467, In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained.
32373467, Ocular involvement and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should never be overlooked.
32373467, In fact, conjunctival mucosae are susceptible to respiratory viruses and remain an important point of entry.
32373467, For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.© 2020 The Author(s).
32373340, The major first symptoms included fever (52.63%), cough (31.58%), dyspnea (23.68%), myalgia and fatigue (15.79%).Among the death cases, persons with underlying diseases and aged over 65 made up the majority.
32373340, The time between the first symptoms and death decreased with the advanced age.
32373340, In all the age groups, males dominated the fatalities.Copyright © 2020 by the Journal of Global Health.

32373237, Conclusion: There was an association of older age and larger consolidation in upper lungs on admission with higher odds of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.© The author(s).
32373235, Conclusions: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.© The author(s).
32372695, Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval.
32372695, This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19.
32372695, The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting.
32372695, The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.
32372026, In conclusion, corticosteroid use in subjects with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections delayed virus clearing and did not convincingly improve survival, reduce hospitalization duration or ICU admission rate and/or use of mechanical ventilation.
32372026, There were several adverse effects.
32372026, Because of a preponderance of observational studies in the dataset and selection and publication biases our conclusions, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, need confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.
32372026, In the interim we suggest caution using corticosteroids in persons with COVID-19.
32371611, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13).
32371611, In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905).
32371611, Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001).Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score.
32371611, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.
32371564, Data are emerging from retrospective clinical studies conducted in Wuhan, China, showing the symptoms and characteristics of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
32371564, Radiographic data on COVID-19 cases reveal bilateral opacities on chest radiography and ground-glass opacities on computed tomography.

32371551, Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hotspots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors.
32371551, The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.
32371551, We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health.Copyright ©2020, American Association for Cancer Research.
32371536, Vacuoles contained double-membrane vesicles suggestive of partially assembled virus.The presence of viral particles in the renal tubular epithelium that were morphologically identical to SARS-CoV-2, and with viral arrays and other features of virus assembly, provide evidence of a productive direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2.
32371536, This finding offers confirmatory evidence that direct renal infection occurs in the setting of AKI in COVID-19.
32371536, However, the frequency and clinical significance of direct infection in COVID-19 is unclear.

32370766, To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment.
32370766, However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill.
32370766, While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use.
32370766, This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare.
32370758, Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data.
32370758, In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses.
32370758, An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32370758, This can accelerate the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, hopefully, of future pandemics due to other emerging zoonotic RNA viruses.
32370747, Lesions in most of the 15 patients (67%) who received chest CT at discharge were not completely absorbed, and 26% of these pediatric patients had CT lesions that were either unchanged or worse.There were a few differences between COVID-19 children and COVID-19 adults in terms of laboratory findings and CT characteristics.
32370747, CT is a powerful tool to detect and characterize COVID-19 pneumonia but has little utility in evaluating clinical recovery for children.
32370747, These results oppose current COVID-19 hospital discharge criteria in China, as one requirement is that pulmonary imaging must show significant lesion absorption prior to discharge.
32370747, These differences between pediatric and adult cases of COVID-19 may necessitate pediatric-specific discharge criteria.
32370606, While there are global efforts to boost personal protective equipment (PPE) production, many centers are improvising care strategies, including the implementation of technology to prevent healthcare workers' exposures and reduce the waste of invaluable PPE.
32370606, Not optimizing glycemic control due to clinical inertia driven by fear or lack of supplies may lead to poor outcomes in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.
32370606, Individualized care strategies, novel therapeutic regimens, and the use of diabetes technology may reduce these barriers.
32370606, However, systematic evaluation of these changes in care is necessary to evaluate both patient- and community-centered outcomes.
32370577, ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of age, CRP and lymphocyte count for disease progression were 0.873, 0.911 and 0.817, respectively.Conclusions: Older age increased CRP and decreased lymphocyte count resulted in potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression.
32370577, This may be helpful in identifying patients whose condition worsens at an early stage.
32370561, Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies.
32370561, A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients.
32370561, Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity.
32370561, Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.
32370129,In a pandemic situation such as that we are living at the time of writing of this paper due to the Covid-19 virus, the need of tele-healthcare service becomes dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients, thence reducing the risk of infection.
32370129, Leveraging the recent Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper aims at proposing a tele-medical laboratory service where clinical exams are performed on patients directly in a hospital by technicians through IoT medical devices and results are automatically sent via the hospital Cloud to doctors of federated hospitals for validation and/or consultation.
32370129, In particular, we discuss a distributed scenario where nurses, technicians and medical doctors belonging to different hospitals cooperate through their federated hospital Clouds to form a virtual health team able to carry out a healthcare workflow in secure fashion leveraging the intrinsic security features of the Blockchain technology.
32370129, In particular, both public and hybrid Blockchain scenarios are discussed and assessed using the Ethereum platform.
32370128, However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions.
32370128, DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males.
32370128, Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.
32370128, The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados.
32369736, We found that subjects with T2D required more medical interventions and had a significantly higher mortality (7.8% versus 2.7%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49) and multiple organ injury than the non-diabetic individuals.
32369736, Further, we found that well-controlled BG (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) was associated with markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled BG (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted HR, 0.14) during hospitalization.
32369736, These findings provide clinical evidence correlating improved glycemic control with better outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32369666, The cumulative incidence of VTE was higher in the ICU (26% (95% CI, 17-37), 47% (95% CI, 34-58), and 59% (95% CI, 42-72) at 7, 14 and 21 days) than on the wards (any VTE and symptomatic VTE 5.8% (95% CI, 1.4-15), 9.2% (95% CI, 2.6-21), and 9.2% (2.6-21) at 7, 14, and 21 days).
32369666, The observed risk for VTE in COVID-19 is high, particularly in ICU patients, which should lead to a high level of clinical suspicion and low threshold for diagnostic imaging for DVT or PE.
32369666, Future research should focus on optimal diagnostic and prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE and potentially improve survival.This article is protected by copyright.

32369429, Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
32369429, Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
32369429, Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
32369429, To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
32369409, Since that time, community spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the state has changed the practice of oncologic care at our comprehensive cancer center in Seattle.
32369409, At the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the primary oncology clinic for the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Consortium, our specialists who manage adult patients with hematologic malignancies have rapidly adjusted clinical practices to mitigate the potential risks of COVID-19 to our patients.
32369409, We suggest that our general management decisions and modifications in Seattle are broadly applicable to patients with hematologic malignancies.
32369409, Despite a rapidly changing environment that necessitates opinion-based care, we provide recommendations that are based on best available data from clinical trials and collective knowledge of disease states.

32369097, Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15).This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity.
32369097, These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32369097, However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.
32369029, This evaluation shows that the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number (R0=0) were satisfied.
32369029, Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population, as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes (ie, B=0).With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study were carried out to complement the analytical results and investigate the effect that the implementation of quarantine and observation procedures has on the projection of further virus spread.As shown by the results, the proportion of the infected population, in the absence of a curative vaccination, will continue to grow worldwide; meanwhile, the recovery rate will continue slowly, which means that the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded.
32369029, Most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population, which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.©Alexander Victor Okhuese.

32368928, CONCLUSION.
32368928, The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results.
32368928, Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.
32368875, A questionnaire should be made for COVID-19.
32368875, In cancer cases requiring urgent treatment, radionuclide treatment (RNT) should be planned according to the COVID-19 test result.
32368875, If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.
32368875, Following imaging procedures, scanners and room surfaces should be cleaned by personnel with proper disinfection training.
32368800, Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort level in discussing concerns with attendings (r = 0.72, P < .00001) and inversely correlated with perceptions of increased risk compared to attendings (r = -0.52, P < .00001).U.S.
32368800, OHNS residency programs implemented policy changes quickly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32368800, Sources of resident anxieties demonstrate the importance of open communication and an integrated team approach to facilitate optimal patient and provider care during this unprecedented crisis.4.

32368799, The infectious nature of COVID-19 poses an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers that should be taken into consideration.We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and look back at previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID-19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy.
32368799, If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel.
32368799, Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure.Thorough preprocedural planning, use of experienced personnel, enhanced personal protective equipment where available, and a thoughtful anesthesia approach are instrumental in maximizing positive patient outcomes while successfully protecting the safety of healthcare personnel.

32368728, The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74•7% and specificity of 68•7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0•717.
32368728, The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67•9% and specificity of 78•2% (AUC=0•730).
32368728, The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.
32368728, This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Hubei Province (MSTIP).© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32368570, The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.
32368570, COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.

32367888, CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32367812, A few days later he was admitted to the University Hospital, Landspitali, due to worsening respiratory symptoms and severe fatigue.
32367812, A computed tomography scan of lthe lungs showed diffuse bilateral consolidations and ground glass changes.
32367812, He developed respiratory failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit where he received further treatment, including tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor inhibitor).
32367812, He subsequently showed clinical improvement and did not require endotracheal intubation.
32367793, Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007).Among the cases, most patients were young adults.
32367793, Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females.
32367793, Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure.
32367793, Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.
32367765, Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for disease progression.
32367765, The optimal cutoff values for FAR and PLT count were 0.0883 and 135*109/L, respectively.
32367765, The C-index [0.712 (95% CI = 0.610-0.814)], decision curve, clinical impact curve showed that Nomogram could be used to predict the disease progression.
32367765, In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that potential risk decreased in patients with FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*109/L.The model showed a good negative predictive value [(0.9474 (95%CI = 0.845-0.986)].This study revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for severe illness and the severity of COVID-19 might be excluded when FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*109/L.
32367749, Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding.
32367749, Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal.
32367749, The phenomenon disappeared after 17 days when the patient was cured.
32367749, This case emphasized the importance of peripheral blood smear and clinical manifestation, especially in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.
32367746, Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus but the reasons are unclear.
32367746, This review will highlight the relationship of coronavirus disease 2019 with hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective.
32367746, We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers affect this important pathway.
32367746, Given the importance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019.
32367615, Emerging technologies, including CRISPR gene-editing tools, benefit from high sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostics and the easy use of lateral-flow assays.
32367615, DNA sequencing and sample pooling strategies are highlighted to bring out the full capacity of the available biosensor technologies and accelerate mass testing.© 2020 The Authors.

32367170, Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant.
32367170, Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008).
32367170, Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups.Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.
32367170, Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.
32366816, In March 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States (US).
32366816, The production of mRNA-based vaccines is a promising recent development in the production of vaccines.
32366816, However, there remain significant challenges in the development and testing of vaccines as rapidly as possible to control COVID-19, which requires international collaboration.
32366816, This review aims to describe the background to the rationale for the development of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the current status of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.
32366765, Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice.
32366765, We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year.

32366488, The average periods of incubation, clinical onset serial interval (COSI), and virus shedding were 4.5 days, 5.2±3.2 days, and 18.5 days, respectively.
32366488, Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure with small, irrelevant mutations was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability.SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted person-to-person regardless of whether they have symptoms in both hospital settings and social activities based on the short period of incubation and COSI.
32366488, The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close-contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas.
32366488, Besides, the HCWs should be alert during the epidemic, and make self-quarantine if self-suspected.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32366319, We explored the method used to develop the claim that chiropractic adjustments impact the immune system and discuss the scientific merit of that claim.
32366319, We provide a response to the ICA reports and explain why this claim lacks scientific credibility and is dangerous to the public.
32366319, More than 150 researchers from 11 countries reviewed and endorsed our response.In their reports, the ICA provided no valid clinical scientific evidence that chiropractic care can impact the immune system.
32366319, We call on regulatory authorities and professional leaders to take robust political and regulatory action against those claiming that chiropractic adjustments have a clinical impact on the immune system.
32366290, The number of severe cases has increased dramatically worldwide, while specific treatment options are scarce.
32366290, The main pathologic features of severe or critical COVID-19 were consistent with acute lung injure (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by cellular fibromyxoid exudates, extensive pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation.
32366290, Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can balance the inflammatory response and has been mentioned to be effective on ALI/ARDS from both infectious and noninfectious causes previously, presenting an important opportunity to be applied to COVID-19.
32366290, In this commentary, we summarize the clinical trials of MSCs treatments on ALI/ARDS and raise MSCs as a hopefully alternative therapy for severe or critical COVID-19.
32366279, Notably, overexpression of ACE2 have been observed in including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
32366279, In addition, hypo DNA methylation of ACE2 has also been identified in most of these ACE2 highly expressed tumors.
32366279, Conclusively, our study for the first time curated both genetic and epigenetic variations of ACE2 in human malignancies.
32366279, Notably, because our study is a bioinformatics assay, further functional and clinical validation is warranted.
32366173, In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management.
32366173, The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection.
32366173, In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department.
32366173, The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.
32366160, Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom.
32366160, A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks.Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19.
32366160, Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease.
32366160, Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.
32366034, This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).
32366034, Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment.
32366034, Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared.
32366034, This overview will address several issues concerned with the COVID-19 pandemic that directly relate to dental practice in terms of prevention, treatment, and orofacial clinical manifestations.
32365466, This virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus group, the same group of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2.
32365466, Given the lack of registered clinical therapies or vaccines, many physicians and scientists are investigating previously used clinical drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
32365466, In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the CoVs origin, pathogenicity, and genomic structure, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.
32365466, Besides, we summarize the recently investigated drugs that constitute an option for COVID-19 treatment.
32365415, For patients with severe aortic stenosis, efforts to bring treatment to symptomatic patients amid this pandemic might lead to favored use of catheter based management using minimalist techniques that do not require these elements.
32365415, In this context, some patients with well tested surgical indications for valve replacement may be treated by catheter-based methods.
32365415, It is important that outcomes for these cases are followed closely both at respective sites and in national registries.
32365415, As we recover from this pandemic, surgical cases should once again be driven by multi-disciplinary discussion and clinical trial data, and not a mentality of crisis management.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32365353, Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC).
32365353, T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA to rescue viable virus.
32365353, Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments.
32365353, The technical advance we describe here allows a rapidly response to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants-in real-time-during an outbreak.
32365277, The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the disease, a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, even as COVID-19 rapidly spread across the world.
32365277, According to clinical reports, fever, headache, cough and myalgia are common clinical symptoms.

32365221, IL-2R/lymphocytes were superior compared with other markers for the identification of COVID-19 with critical illness, not only from mild but also from severe illness.
32365221, Moreover, the cytokine profiles and IL-2R/lymphocytes were significantly decreased in recovered patients, but further increased in disease-deteriorated patients, which might be correlated with the outcome of COVID-19.
32365221, Lymphopenia and increased levels of cytokines were closely associated with disease severity.

32363880, Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved yet to treat infections with human coronaviruses.
32363880, As it will take years to develop new therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the current focus is on the repurposing of drugs that have been approved or are in development for other conditions.
32363880, Several clinical trials have already been conducted or are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of such drugs.
32363880, Here, we discuss the potential of these therapies for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.

32363506, Forty-six percent queried about clinical services; 28% communicated an acute clinical worsening for which a therapeutic change was done in 52% of cases; 17% (those patients with younger age and milder disease) asked about the relationship between PD and COVID-19; 8% informed about an intercurrent event.
32363506, Our analysis suggests that PD patients' needs during COVID-19 emergency include appropriate and complete information, a timely update on changes in clinical services, and the continuity of care, even in a remote mode.
32363506, By addressing these issues, acute clinical worsening, complications and subsequent therapeutic changes could be prevented.
32363506, In this perspective, telecommunication systems and virtual medicine should be implemented.
32363409, However, observing the trend of the infections in China and the geographic areas of the main outbreaks, it could be hypothesized that air pollution plays a role.
32363409, In particular, it has been previously demonstrated, in specific populations, a role of particulate matter in worsening clinical presentation of virus infection in airways.
32363409, Without prejudice to the ascertained virus spread by air droplets or contaminated surfaces, the factors that could have favored its spread remain to be investigated.
32363409, Moreover, if these observations were to be confirmed, when the health emergency is resolved, it will be mandatory to redesign an economic-productive model in balance with the environment.
32363349,Health care providers are facing increased risk of moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic because of changes in clinical practice and resource allocation procedures.
32363349, Health care systems that employ a proactive approach in mitigating the lasting effects of moral distress will fare better in the long run.
32363349, Psychologists are well poised to apply timely psychological first aid to the crisis needs of patients, colleagues, and even themselves.

32363337,Since the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019, its infection - COVID-19 - has been associated with severe morbidity and mortality and has left world governments, healthcare systems and providers caring for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, wrestling with the optimal management strategy.
32363337, Unique physiologic and ethical considerations negate a one-size-fits-all approach to the care of critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19, and few resources exist to guide the multi-disciplinary team through decisions regarding optimal maternal-fetal surveillance, intensive care procedures, and delivery timing.
32363337, We present a case of rapid clinical decompensation and development of severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in a woman at 31 weeks' gestation to highlight these unique considerations and present an algorithmic approach to the disease's diagnosis and management.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32363205, The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed.Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission.
32363205, It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later.
32363205, After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus.

32362969, Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, there is the rapid transmission, long incubation period, and disease containment is becoming extremely difficult.
32362969, The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers.
32362969, We also discussed various preventive measures to combat COVID-19 effectively.
32362969, A systematic and protocol-driven approach is needed to contain this disease, which was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the WHO.Copyright 2020, Balla et al.
32362645, Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer.
32362645, Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden.
32362645, Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus.
32362645, As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.
32362644, Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO2of <94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age >60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons.
32362644, Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes.
32362644, Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32362644, If found useful in managing initial SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.
32362564, This document provides guidance on how to proceed with and adapt ENT surgery in the current pandemic context, as well as on the management of postponed operations.

32362244, A total of 41 conclusions and practice implications have been developed.
32362244, The document includes practice implications for evaluation of stroke patients with caution for stroke team members to avoid COVID-19 exposure, during clinical evaluation and performance of imaging and laboratory procedures with special considerations of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.These practice implications with consensus based on the currently available evidence aim to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke who are suspected of, or confirmed, with COVID-19 infection.
32362244, Under certain circumstances, however, only limited evidence is available to support these practice implications, suggesting an urgent need for establishing procedures for the management of stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32362243, Arjunglucoside-I (-7.88 Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99 Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding affinity with favourable ADME properties.
32362243, These compounds on MD simulations for 50ns shows strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and remains stable inside the active site.
32362243, Our virtual screening results suggest that these small chemical molecules can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and may have an anti-viral effect on nCoV.
32362243, However, further validation and investigation of these inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease are needed to claim their candidacy for clinical trials.
32362193, It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients.
32362193, IFN-α2b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection.
32362193, Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo.
32362193, The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.
32362062, Keeping the integrity of skin barrier is a critical method to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV, since skin is the first line of defense of human body(4).
32362062, It is of prime importance to ensure and maintain the skin clean, sterilized and protected of clinical health care staff during the fight against the epidemic.
32362062, Self-protection of the medical staff is essential, however, utilizing protective equipment such as goggles, masks and protective clothing continuously impairs skin integrity and the skin damage caused by the respective protective measures must be taken seriously.This article is protected by copyright.

32362061, Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials.
32362061, Furthermore, dupilumab has been proved to be efficacious also in exacerbations of asthma, and it is known that viral infections can worsen asthma.
32362061, Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic.

32361715, This, some have argued, constitutes intellectual indolence, it is not scientific robustness.
32361715, Pandits foresee that the world will be different after the end of this pandemic.
32361715, Perhaps human ingenuity will seek new investigative methods that will render the randomised clinical trial obsolete, both, on methodological and ethical grounds.
32361715, Until then and even if we have to accept the scientific supremacy of the randomised study in the evaluation of novel therapies, the ethical considerations in the unprecedented circumstances of a relentless pandemic demand a more humane approach, befitting the beneficent precepts of the Hippocratic tradition.

32361161, On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.
32361161, According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems.
32361161, In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32361152, When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process.The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements.The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse.
32361152, To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections.
32361152, In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.Copyright © 2020.

32361098, We hypothesize that the infection of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV will lead to inflammatory pathological lesions in patients' target organs, and possibly inflammatory lesions in salivary glands. 2019-nCoV may cause acute sialoadenitis in the acute phase of infection.
32361098, After the acute phase, chronic sialoadenitis may be caused by fibrosis repairment.

32361028, Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence, interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate.
32361028, It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment.  We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes.

32359101,As of April 20, 2020, over time, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 157 970 deaths out of 2 319 066 confirmed cases, at a Case Fatality Rate of ~6.8%. With the pandemic rapidly spreading, and health delivery systems being overwhelmed, it is imperative that safe and effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies are rapidly explored to improve survival.
32359101, In this paper, we use established and emerging evidence to propose a testable hypothesis that, a vicious positive feedback loop of des-Arg(9)-bradykinin- and bradykinin-mediated inflammation → injury → inflammation, likely precipitates life threatening respiratory complications in COVID-19.
32359101, Through our hypothesis, we make the prediction that the FDA-approved molecule, icatibant, might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and, thereby, improve the clinical outcomes.
32359101, This hypothesis could lead to basic, translational, and clinical studies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.© 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
32359035, The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality.
32359035, TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05).In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option.
32359035, An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed.
32359035, Future controlled trials in patients with severe illness are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with IL-6 target therapy.

32358230, Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases.
32358230, Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature.The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources.

32357575, According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19.
32357575, The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person's vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis.
32357575, The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.
32357575, There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
32357503, Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
32357503, In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
32357503, Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32357503, Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.

32357086, At learning level, the differences between theoretical and operational scores of tested nurses before and after training proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.001).Conclusion:The application of Kirkpatrick's model based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 confirms to be effective for the training program of nurses in the emergency surgery department.
32357086, It is also beneficial to improve nurses' knowledge and skills during the pandemic, which serves as a positive influence for clinical reference.
32357074, Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality.
32357074, Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32357074, We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from American Society for Artificial Internal Organs.

32356926, The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7.
32356926, High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS.
32356926, Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS.
32356926, In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32356910, We included five studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients.
32356910, The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma.
32356910, Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients appears safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality.

32356900, Significant institutional preparation is required to optimise staff and patient safety in preparing for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group.
32356900, The principles for airway management should be the same for all patients with COVID-19 (asymptomatic, mild or critically unwell).
32356900, Safe, simple, familiar, reliable and robust practices should be adopted for all episodes of airway management for patients with COVID-19.Airway clinicians in Australia and New Zealand should now already be involved in regular intensive training for the airway management of the COVID-19 patient group.
32356900, This training should focus on the principles of early intervention, meticulous planning, vigilant infection control, efficient processes, clear communication and standardised practice.© 2020 AMPCo Pty Ltd.
32356867, The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%).
32356867, The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]).
32356867, The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings.
32356867, The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]).In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.
32356863, Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more.
32356863, The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]).
32356863, Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes.In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc.
32356863, Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.
32356761, We shared the lessons learned and the obstacles encountered during real world high-volume screening programs.
32356761, Clinical needs are discussed to identify existing technology gaps in these tests.
32356761, Leverage technologies, such as engineered polymerases, isothermal amplification, and direct amplification from complex matrices may improve the productivity of current infrastructure, while emerging technologies like CRISPR diagnostics, visual end point detection, and PCR free methods for nucleic acid sensing may lead to at-home tests.
32356761, The lessons learned, and innovations spurred from the COVID-19 pandemic could upgrade our global public health infrastructure to better combat potential outbreaks in the future.
32356641, These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
32356641, Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
32356641, Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
32356641, This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.
32356627, Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.Among both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.
32356627, The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.
32356627, Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.In this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.
32356627, However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.
32356626, Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge.
32356626, The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those ≤65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47).
32356626, No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
32356626, Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

32356583,The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is endangering human health worldwide; scarcity of published pediatric cases and current literature and the absence of evidence-based guidelines necessitate international sharing of experience and personal communication.
32356583, On 31 March 2020 the International Committee of the American Thoracic Society Pediatrics Assembly recorded an online podcast, during which pediatric pulmonologists worldwide shared their experience on the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children.
32356583, The aim was to share personal experience in organizing pediatric care in different health care settings globally, protecting health care workers, and isolation practices.
32356583, This manuscript summarizes the common themes of the podcast which centered around three main topics: more benign clinical disease and progression in pediatric cases compared to adults, a strong need for strategies to protect health care workers, and social or economic disparities as a barrier to successful pandemic control.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32356025, The main histologic findings observed were pneumocyte damage, alveolar hemorrhages with clustering of macrophages, prominent and diffuse neutrophilic margination within septal vessels, and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, mainly represented by CD8+ T lymphocytes.
32356025, These features are similar to those previously described in SARS-CoV-1 infection.
32356025, Subtle histologic changes suggestive pulmonary involvement by Covid-19 may be accidentally encountered in routine pathology practice, especially when extensive sampling is performed for histology.
32356025, These findings should be carefully interpreted in light of the clinical context of the patient and could prompt a pharyngeal swab PCR test to rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients.
32355889, Conclusion  Our analysis shows that there is currently lack of consensus among gastroenterologists in regards to timing of semi-urgent or non-life-threatening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32355889, These results support the need for the ongoing development of societal guidance for these "semi-urgent" scenarios to help gastroenterologists in making difficult triage decisions.
32355546, The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated.
32355546, Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity.The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993]. In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result.
32355546, In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970].The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19.
32355546, Further investigations should be done to evaluate this assay in variety of clinical settings and populations.AJTR Copyright © 2020.
32355099, At a local level one trauma hospital in Queens, New York, Orthopedic Surgery elective cases have been cancelled, trauma consult volume has experienced a sharp decline, and both residents and attendings have been repurposed to meet the new clinical demands of this medical crisis.
32355099, Our own orthopedic surgery service has adopted care for patients normally admitted to an internal medicine service in a novel Ortho-Medical COVID-19 management team.
32355099, We prepared this primer to make our experience with caring for COVID-19 patents available as a reference for other surgical subspecialty services preparing to adjust the clinical focus of their hospital teams during this or future pandemics.

32354360, By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia.
32354360, However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death.
32354360, Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness.A period of 7-13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course.
32354360, Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.
32354293, There are reports of neonatal infection, but no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission has been found.Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of non-pregnant adults.
32354293, Fetal and neonatal outcomes appear good in most cases, but available data only include pregnant women infected in their third trimesters.
32354293, Further studies are needed to ascertain long-term outcomes and potential intrauterine vertical transmission.
32354181, High-impact articles covered fields of basic science and clinical medicine.
32354181, There were two sharp increases in research yields after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks.
32354181, International collaborations promoted study progress, and universities and academies act as the main force in coronavirus research.
32354181, More research on prevention and treatment is needed according to an analysis of term density.
32354081, The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak.
32354081, Considering the virus' route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection).
32354081, This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices.
32354081, This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice to reduce infection risk.
32353982, Although great concern has been expressed about COVID-19 infection acquired through ocular transmission, its underlying mechanism has not currently been clarified.
32353982, In the current work, we analyzed and elucidated the two main elements that should be taken into account to understand the "ocular route", both from a clinical and molecular point of view.
32353982, They are represented by the dynamism of the ocular surface system (e.g., the tear film turnover) and the distribution of ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 protein.
32353982, Although it seems, at the moment, that there is a low risk of coronavirus spreading through tears, it may survive for a long time or replicate in the conjunctiva, even in absence of conjunctivitis signs, indicating that eye protection (e.g., protective goggles alone or in association with face shield) is advisable to prevent contamination from external droplets and aerosol.
32353898, Little is known about the mechanisms behind observed episodes of sudden deterioration or the infrequent idiosyncratic clinical demise in otherwise healthy and young subjects.
32353898, As in other diseases, the answer to some of these questions may in time be provided by genotyping as well careful clinical, serological, radiological and histopathological phenotyping, which enable mechanistic insights into the differences in pathogenesis and underlying immunological and tissue regenerative response patterns.
32353898, We will aim to provide a brief overview of the existing evidence for such differences in host response and outcome, and generate hypotheses for divergent patterns and avenues for future research, by highlighting similarities and differences in histopathological appearance between COVID19 and influenza as well as previous coronavirus outbreaks, and by discussing predisposition through genetics and underlying disease.This article is protected by copyright.

32353859, To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs).
32353859, Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds).
32353859, Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors.
32353859, Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.
32353857, I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis.
32353857, After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations.
32353857, I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in.
32353857, This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases.
32353760, One sample was detected on the SHC laboratory developed test (LDT) and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9.
32353760, Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6.The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

32353223, In the first 3 days, prone positioning (12-16 h) was used in 63.8% of patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in five patients (6.8%).
32353223, After a median follow-up of 19.0 days (IQR, 15.0-27.0 days), 17 patients (23.3%) had died, 23 (31.5%) had been discharged from the ICU, and 33 (45.2%) were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

32352401, Conclusions Laboratory abnormalities and acute renal failure were common in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 infection in our center.
32352401, Admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation were common.
32352397, Conclusions We designed a clinically predictive tool which is easy to use for assessing the progression risk of COVID-19, and the NLP score could be used to facilitate patient stratification management.
32352308, CONCLUSION.
32352308, Although the clinical symptoms of SARS, H1N1, MERS, EVALI, and COVID-19 pneumonia in pediatric patients may be nonspecific, some characteristic imaging findings have emerged or are currently emerging.
32352308, It is essential for radiologists to have a clear understanding of the characteristic imaging appearances of these lung disorders in pediatric patients to ensure optimal patient care.
32352202, The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea.
32352202, Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients.The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients.
32352202, Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.This article is protected by copyright.

32352081, Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human.
32352081, However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19.
32352081, Considering the fact, this review article provides 1) an overview on the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs, heart and brain, 2) signifies the therapeutic uses of BoNTs against pulmonary failure, cardiac arrest and neurological deficits, and 3) emphasize the rationality for the possible use of BoNT to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19.© 2020 The Author(s).

32350928, Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections.
32350928, Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease.
32350928, In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.© 2020 The Authors.

32350861, In a crisis, people are rightly looking for solutions from their leaders and experts and their response and actions will define them for years to come.

32350861, Though most drug development takes years from discovery to approval, for the COVID-19 pandemic, drug development is on a fundamentally different timeline.This article is protected by copyright.

32350818, No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment.
32350818, After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment.
32350818, None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment.Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter.
32350818, This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.
32350796, According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays.
32350796, In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation.
32350796, Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement.
32350796, Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.
32350794, Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up.
32350794, In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool.
32350794, SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients.
32350794, In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.
32350686, There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.
32350686, Until now, it is still unclear which drug can successfully fight against the disease.
32350686, Therefore, for the better safety of patients with COVID-19, further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all the potential drugs.
32350686, Such a measure requires action at the global level.
32350632, Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia.
32350632, The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive.
32350632, Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19.
32350632, Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.
32350226, The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens.
32350226, While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.
32350226, Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
32350226, These indicate that the protocol using the N and N2 sets is comparable to commercially available kits and is reliable for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.
32350161, Comparison of various indexes of coagulation function between the two groups in admission, the proportion of abnormal coagulation indicators in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group (100% vs. 66.1%).
32350161, The median coagulation parameters in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group: international normalized ratio (1.04 vs. 1.01), prothrombin time (13.8 vs. 13.4) seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (43.2 vs. 39.2) seconds, fibrinogen (4.74 vs. 4.33) g/L, fibrinogen degradation products (2.61 vs. 0.99) µg/mL, and D-dimer (1.04 vs. 0.43) µg/mL, the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
32350161, Coagulation dysfunction is common in patients with COVID-19, especially fibrinogen and D-dimer elevation, and the degree of elevation is related to the severity of the disease.
32350161, As the disease recovers, fibrinogen and activated partial thromboplastin time also return to normal.
32350134, No obvious adverse reactions were observed.
32350134, All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab.
32350134, Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

32350048, The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens.
32350048, The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay.
32350048, All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.
32350048, Our results provide initial test performance characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a public health emergency.Copyright © 2020 Lieberman et al.
32350047, While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays.
32350047, The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning, given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen and the acceptable specimen types.
32350047, An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate, or perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate.
32350047, Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role in during our global response to this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Theel et al.

32349772,Recently, an outbreak of viral pneumonitis in Wuhan, Hubei, China successively spread as a global pandemia, led to the identification of a novel betacoronavirus species, the 2019 novel coronavirus, successively designated 2019-nCoV then SARS-CoV-2).
32349772, The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32349772, Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies.
32349772, This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.
32349517, For a better popularization of TCM, governments have made several advances in regulations and policies for treatment and measures of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32349517, Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like.
32349517, In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.
32349517, We would like to see these relevant studies, ranging from basic researches to clinical application, could provide some idea on effects of CHM to combat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses, and also offer new thinking for the exploration of therapeutic strategies under the guidance of TCM.
32349183, For approval, median votes were required to meet pre-defined levels of agreement (median values of 7-9, 4-6, and 1-3 defined as "agreement", "uncertainty" or "disagreement", respectively) with either moderate or high levels of consensus.The task force approved 77 initial guidance statements, 36 with moderate and 41 with high consensus.
32349183, These were combined, resulting in 25 final guidance statements.These guidance statements are provided to promote optimal care during the current pandemic.
32349183, However, given the low level of available evidence and the rapidly evolving literature, this guidance is presented as a "living document" and future updates are anticipated.This article is protected by copyright.

32349133, A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.
32349133, Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state.
32349133, Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity.
32349133, Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32349055,In this hypothesis paper, we suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may induce intravascular pulmonary thrombosis, which may result in the rapid worsening of clinical conditions and, eventually, exitus.
32349055, Previously published papers have demonstrated that increased levels of D-dimer at hospital admission correlate with a more severe disease (0.5 mg/L) or occurrence of death (1 mg/L).
32349055, The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement.
32349055, If this hypothesis is demonstrated, this could suggest the benefit of using antithrombotic/coagulation regimens for SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, the urgency to identify drugs that could alter the inflammatory storm, thus protecting the vessel wall.
32349053, This "protection by exclusion" of pregnant women from drug development and clinical therapeutic trials, even during epidemics and pandemics, is not unprecedented.
32349053, Moreover, it is both misguided and not justifiable and may have excluded them from potentially beneficial interventions.
32349053, This is another missed opportunity to obtain pregnancy-specific safety and efficacy data, because therapeutics developed for men and nonpregnant women may not be generalizable to pregnant women.
32349053, Therefore, we recommend and urge the scientific community and professional societies that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19 based on the concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent.
32349033, They can also be integrated into point-of-care products.
32349033, Furthermore, environmental biosensors can be designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the ambient air or in the intensive care ventilators.
32349033, Here, we evaluate technical components of biosensors, including the biological targets of recognition, the recognition methods and the signal amplification and transduction systems.
32349033, Effective SARS-CoV-2 detectors can be designed by adequate combination of these technologies.
32349014, Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles.
32349014, Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to "flatten the curve" supersedes usual teaching responsibilities.
32349014, Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines.
32349014, The pool of graduating medical students affected by this pause in direct patient contact represents a powerful reserve, which may soon need to be utilized as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the U.S. health care infrastructure.
32348783,Early clinical evidence suggests that severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are frequently characterized by hyperinflammation, imbalance of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and a particular form of vasculopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, and intravascular coagulopathy.
32348783, In this paper, we present an immunothrombosis model of COVID-19.
32348783, We discuss the underlying pathogenesis and the interaction between multiple systems, resulting in propagation of immunothrombosis, which through investigation in the coming weeks, may lead to both an improved understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and identification of innovative and efficient therapeutic targets to reverse the otherwise unfavorable clinical outcome of many of these patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32348591, As this pandemic of COVID-19 may last longer than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a practical workflow for managing dysphagia is crucial to ensure a safe and efficient practice to patients and health care personnel.
32348591, This document provides clinical practice guidelines based on available evidence to date to balance the risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with the risks associated with dysphagia.
32348591, Critical considerations include reserving instrumental assessments for urgent cases only, optimizing the noninstrumental swallowing evaluation, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and use of telehealth when appropriate.
32348591, Despite significant limitations in clinical service provision during the pandemic of COVID-19, a safe and reasonable dysphagia care pathway can still be implemented with modifications of setup and application of newer technologies.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32348588, In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate.
32348588, Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.© 2020 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.
32348582, Until recently, most guidelines were reported to aid in managing and treating suspected or confirmed cases.
32348582, Research institutions around the world are responding with a sense of confusion.
32348582, Some are continuing routinely, especially those who are overseeing clinical trials that could offer life-saving therapies, particularly against the novel coronavirus.
32348582, Since research must continue even in the face of a shutdown, we aim to collate the currently available recommendations from various organizations and provide guidance to head and neck researchers across the world during these trying times.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32348581, Surgical volume and clinic visits are curtailed, personal protective equipment for operating room participation is restricted, and the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission during heretofore routine patient care is the new norm.We describe a small-team "cohorting" protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures.A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between department members but providing comprehensive coverage.
32348581, Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions.
32348581, Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures.
32348581, Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy.A small-team-based approach with guidelines for faculty/resident roles may mitigate risk while optimizing patient care and maximizing education.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32348545, Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings.
32348545, Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular).We provide a description of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection.
32348545, These may help clinicians approach patients with the disease and recognize paucisymptomatic cases.This article is protected by copyright.

32348339, We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features.
32348339, We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19.Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization.
32348339, The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23-8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL.These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19.
32348339, But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.Our study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the registration number: ChiCTR2000029829.
32348166, Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure.
32348166, However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008).
32348166, Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.
32348166, Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.
32348056, The implemented crisis management stood upon three pillars : a crisis management team, steering documents and internal communication.
32348056, In this new form, the Department had already taken care of 442 COVID-19 admissions by April 16, 2020.
32348056, Alongside organizational challenges, clinical issues such as rapid respiratory distress, clinical suspicions with negative PCR and treatment uncertainties in the absence of sufficient evidence were overcome.
32348056, Despite the peak of the pandemic appearing to have passed, the next phase could be just as complicated.
32348055,The SARS-coronavirus 2 disease initially reported in December 2019 in China (COVID-19) represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, due to the high number of ICU admission and the prolonged stay for many patients.
32348055, Up to 5 % of COVID-19 infected patients develop severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment.
32348055, Apart from early antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment, the management of COVID-19 patients is mainly applying protective mechanical ventilation, to support the injured lungs.
32348055, However recently acquired data and clinical experience suggest that COVID-19-related ARDS presents some specificities that will be summarized in the present article.
32348053,Coronavirus pandemic challenges mental health care providers in different ways.
32348053, At an individual level, they have to adapt their clinical practice and consider specific issues of teleconsultations to address patient's needs.
32348053, At a population level, dedicated interventions (e.g. hotlines, health professionals' support) have to strike a balance between « pathologizing » people's reactions and trivializing the psychological effects of a pandemic.
32348053, Finally, psychiatric leaders must be able to advise decision-makers on mental-health policy and communication.
32348052, Systemic corticosteroids have not shown benefit in viral infection, including other coronavirus; thus they should be avoided, unless prescribed for another indication.
32348052, The benefit-risk ratio is however clearly in favor of continuing inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma or COPD.
32348052, ACE inhibitors and sartans upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the pulmonary receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
32348052, Any possible clinical impact of these treatments on COVID-19 infection remains to be clarified; in the meantime, they should be continued.
32348042, The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and associated disease (COVID-19) has alarmed the transplant community, since recommendations for adequate follow-up of organ transplant recipients during the acute phase of a pandemic are limited.
32348042, Furthermore, treatment options against COVID-19 disease and adequate adjustment of immunosuppression in at risk patients remain a concern.
32348042, This review summarizes current knowledge on the incidence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.
32348042, It also discusses therapeutic strategies and provides general recommendations on how to proceed with transplantation programs in a time when health care resources may become scarce.
32347975, The impression is that comorbidities is an important factor in mortality in HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infected cases.

32347772, Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
32347772, Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
32347772, Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772, South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
32347453, The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients.
32347453, A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning.
32347453, A clear communication plan should be implemented early and input from trainees, staff, and faculty should be solicited.Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis.
32347453, Surgical leadership, innovation, and flexibility are critical to successful planning and implementation.
32347201,We describe clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 44 Caucasian patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at a single hospital in Pavia, Italy, from 21-28 February 2020, at the beginning of the outbreak in Europe.
32347201, Seventeen patients developed severe disease, two died.
32347201, After a median of 6 days, 14 patients were discharged from hospital.
32347201, Predictors of lower odds of discharge were age > 65 years, antiviral treatment and for severe disease, lactate dehydrogenase > 300 mg/dL.
32347067, The sensitivity of this method was satisfactory.
32347067, The results were consistent with those of the COVID-19 detection kit on the market under the same conditions, but the number of cycles required was shortened by about 2.
32347067, Therefore, the optimized assay developed in this study can be used in screening and early clinical diagnosis.
32347067, Our work provides a tool to facilitate rapid clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32346873, As of 8 March 2020, all patients have been discharged.
32346873, The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR: 4.0-9.0 days).
32346873, Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.

32346785, Most respondents reported no reduction of elective clinic visits and surgeries and no utilization of triage questionnaires.
32346785, COVID-19 guidelines were reportedly promulgated to hospital ophthalmologists but not to community and private physicians.
32346785, Personal protective equipment (PPE) measures were reportedly utilized; however, many respondents often acquired them individually.
32346785, A majority of respondents advocated that healthcare institutions limit clinic and surgery services to emergency services.During the critical early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, this study emphasizes the delay in development of emergency guidelines, necessary to protect patients and ophthalmologists from this highly transmissible disease.
32346594, The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days.
32346594, The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = -0.42, -0.53, -0.48).
32346594, There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P = 0.0994; rs = 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P = 0.0903, 0.0989).Quantitative CT may have potential in assessing the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.© 2020 Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University.

32346490, Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis.
32346490, Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID-19 outbreak..
32346093, Here, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32346093, We describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system and the subsequent contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression.
32346093, From nascent reports describing SARS-CoV-2, we make inferences on the basis of the parallel pathophysiological and immunological features of the other human coronaviruses targeting the lower respiratory tract - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
32346093, Finally, we highlight the implications of these approaches for potential therapeutic interventions that target viral infection and/or immunoregulation.
32345861, Our multi-level, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places two key tools directly in the hands of providers: 1) A peer-support Battle Buddy; and 2) A designated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation.
32345861, In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations.
32345861, It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic.
32345861, Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse healthcare workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.
32345728, Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined.Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness.
32345728, Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20%, and 36.4%, respectively).
32345728, Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes.Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness.

32345702, We suspect that most AKI cases were intrinsic AKI.
32345702, Patients with renal involvement had higher overall mortality compared with those without renal involvement (28 of 251 [11.2%] versus one of 82 [1.2%], respectively).
32345702, Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that severity of pneumonia was the risk factor most commonly associated with lower odds of proteinuric or hematuric remission and recovery from AKI.Renal abnormalities occurred in the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32345702, Although proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI often resolved in such patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, renal complications in COVID-19 were associated with higher mortality.Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.

32345343, Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU).
32345343, The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care.
32345343, However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS).
32345343, This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.
32345226, Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests.
32345226, Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients.Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan.
32345226, Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems.
32345226, Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.
32344688, Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs.
32344688, For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area.
32344688, Consequently, two datasets are recommended.
32344688, For the final selection of the ideal dataset to be used for printing, scalability and economic efficiency need to be carefully balanced with an acceptable degree of protection.
32344456, However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited.
32344456, The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32344456, These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care.

32344449, To maintain weekly troughs above EC50 in >50% of subjects at steady state in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg twice or three times weekly is required.
32344449, In an exposure driven post-exposure prophylaxis setting, 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days achieved daily troughs above EC50 in >50% subjects.
32344449, These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.This article is protected by copyright.

32344441, However, obstetric patients are not immune from the current COVID-19 pandemic, and obstetric care will inevitably be impacted by the current epidemic.
32344441, As such, clinical protocols and practice on labor and delivery units must adapt to optimize the safety of patients and health care workers and to better conserve health care resources.
32344441, In this commentary, we provide suggestions to meet these goals without impacting maternal or neonatal outcomes.

32344439, In the current manuscript we summarize the strategies, organisational approaches and actions of the Task-force Coronavirus at the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32344439, We also report on experiences with implementation of these approaches and treatment outcomes in the first 115 COVID patients.Retrospective, narrative process description and analysis of the time period between end of January and beginning of April 2020, performed by representatives of the involved departments and institutes.
32344439, Additionally a retrospective observational cohort study with descriptive analysis of epidemiological and clinical data of COVID patients admitted until March 31st was performed.A multidisciplinary Task-force Coronavirus initiated measures concerning outpatient testing and counseling, reorganisation and separation of patient flow processes alongside with substantial escalation of inpatient capacities on regular wards and intensive care units.
32344439, Within the framework of the resulting dynamic care model, 115 patients suffering from COVID could be treated without shortages in staff or bed capacities.In the upcoming pandemic, adequate COVID management and care could be secured by a collaborative approach with inclusion of administrative departments, clinical disciplines and theoretical institutes of the University Medical Center Freiburg.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32344321, The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG.
32344321, Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19.
32344321, Furthermore, patients with IL-6 > 32.1 pg/mL or CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications.The serum levels of IL-6 and CRP can effectively assess disease severity and predict outcome in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32344314, A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD+ T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen.
32344314, Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials.
32344314, We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon α, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32344056, First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course? This is a particularly relevant question because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19.
32344056, Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines?

32344011, While the clinical status, in particular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the need for their admittance to ICUs, several laboratory parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity.
32344011, Clinicians should consider low lymphocyte count as well as the serum levels of CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, cardiac troponin and IL-6, which may be used in risk stratification to predict severe and fatal COVID-19 in hospitalised patients.

32343968, Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking.
32343968, We report two cases of patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated by CRS and were treated with tocilizumab.
32343968, Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
32343968, These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.Published by Elsevier Inc.
32343948, We evaluated the kinetics of IgM, IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients with confirmed (rRT-PCR) infection.
32343948, We found that the IgA response appears and grows early, peaks at week 3, and it is stronger and more persistent than the IgM response.

32343947, However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea.
32343947, The purpose of this perspective paper is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic.
32343947, We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervene if identified with the goal of unburdening healthcare systems during future pandemic crises.Copyright © 2020.

32343745, A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions.
32343745, We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis.
32343745, Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities.
32343745, Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32343658, The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials.
32343658, At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov.
32343658, Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020.Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro.
32343658, There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.
32343593, In addition, post-mortem studies of mice infected by SARS-CoV have demonstrated diffuse damage to the GI tract, with the small bowel showing signs of enterocyte desquamation, edema, small vessel dilation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mesenteric nodes with severe hemorrhage and necrosis.
32343593, Finally, the small bowel is rich in furin, a serine protease which can separate the S-spike of the coronavirus into two "pinchers" (S1 and 2).
32343593, The separation of the S-spike into S1 and S2 is essential for the attachment of the virion to both the ACE receptor and the cell membrane.
32343593, In this special review, we describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cell and enterocyte and its potential clinical implications.
32343415, Here, 26 cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms, and no case of severe symptoms was found among these patients.
32343415, Strikingly, a subset of these patients had SARS-CoV-2 and virus-specific IgG coexist for an unexpectedly long time, with two cases for up to 50 days.
32343415, One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity alone may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2.

32343363, Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic heightened the need for improved collaboration among healthcare organizations and local and state public health.The University of Washington Medicine's (UWM's) Post-Acute Care (PAC) Network developed and implemented a three-phase approach within its pre-existing network of SNFs to help slow the spread of the disease, support local area SNFs from becoming overwhelmed when inundated with COVID-19 cases or persons under investigation, and help decrease the burden on area hospitals, clinics, and emergency medical services.Support of local area SNFs consisted of the following phases that were implemented at various times as COVID-19 impacted each facility at different times.
32343363, Initial Phase: This phase was designed to (1) optimize communication, (2) review infection control practices, and (3) create a centralized process to track and test the target population.
32343363, Delayed Phase: The goals of the Delayed Phase were to slow the spread of the disease once it is present in the SNF by providing consistent education and reinforcing infection prevention and control practices to all staff.
32343363, Surge Phase: This phase aimed to prepare facilities in response to an outbreak by deploying a "Drop Team" within 24 hours to the facility to expeditiously test patients and exposed employees, triage symptomatic patients, and coordinate care and supplies with local public health authorities.The COVID-19 Three-Phase Response Plan provides a standardized model of care that may be implemented by other health systems and SNFs to help prepare and respond to COVID-19.© 2020 The American Geriatrics Society.

32343122, Nervous system involvement was not initially considered to play a significant role in patients with COVID-19.
32343122, However, since this viewpoint was initially published, multiple studies have been released regarding the possible neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2.
32343122, In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus.
32343122, The past few weeks, after the viewpoint surfaced, it was noticed that it has enabled clinicians and healthcare professionals to compute the neurovirulence associated with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by very recently reported studies.
32342872, The derived data has been discussed with expert paediatric radiation oncologists to derive a hierarchy of recommendations.The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis.
32342872, The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed.This review provides evidence-based treatment recommendations during unexpected shortage of paediatric radiotherapy facilities.

32342676, As of April 16, 2020, 10635 confirmed cases have been reported, with 230 deaths in Korea.
32342676, COVID-19 patients may be asymptomatic or show various clinical manifestations, including acute symptoms such as fever, fatigue, sore throat; pneumonia presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome; and multiple organ failure.
32342676, As COVID-19 has such varied clinical manifestations and case fatality rates, no standard antiviral therapy regimen has been established other than supportive therapy.

32342609, We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients.Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy.
32342609, In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications.
32342609, In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.© 2020 electroCore, Inc.

32342479, Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03).
32342479, Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6 (14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation.Older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition.
32342479, Treatments of COVID-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed.
32342191, In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated.
32342191, At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms.The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management.
32342191, Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.
32342191, Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.
32342140, The obtained information is provided as a narrative review.There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic.As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned.
32342140, The exact timing largely depends on factors outside of our control.
32342140, After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase.
32342140, This paper offers key points and possible strategies to provide the highest level of safety to both the orthopaedic patient and the orthopaedic team including administrative staff and nurses, during the start-up phase.Review, Level V.
32341943, On 11 February 2020 the WHO assigned it the name of SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19).
32341943, The Ministry of Health summoned the Specialties Societies to prepare a clinical protocol for the management of COVID-19.

32341913, As demonstrated by the recent coronavirus outbreak, information is not enough.
32341913, During dental practice, blood and saliva can be scattered.
32341913, Accordingly, dental practice can be a potential risk for dental staff, and there is a high risk of cross-infection.
32341913, This article addresses all information collected to date on the virus, in accordance with the guidelines of international health care institutions, and provides a comprehensive protocol for managing possible exposure to patients or those suspected of having coronavirus.© The Author(s) 2020.
32341722, In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
32341722, Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.

32341721, In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
32341721, At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.

32341519, All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered.
32341519, Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered.
32341519, The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients.
32341519, In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.
32341442, Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.
32341442, On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
32341442, Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present.
32341442, Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.
32341311, During the examination, digital tools can be utilized as needed.
32341311, In the setting of outpatient injury evaluations, a systematic virtual examination can aid in triaging and managing common musculoskeletal conditions.
32341311, With the rapid incorporation of telehealth visits, as well as the unknown future with regard to the pandemic, the utilization and capabilities of telemedicine will continue to expand.
32341311, Future directions include the development of validated, modified examination techniques and new technology that will allow for improved interactive physical examinations, as we rapidly move forward into the realm of telemedicine due to unexpected necessity.
32341143, Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically.
32341143, To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19 positive patients.
32341143, In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Modified CDC), the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular), GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 assay (GenMark) and the Hologic Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic).
32341143, This information is crucial for both laboratories and clinical teams, as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made.Copyright © 2020 Zhen et al.
32341142, Compatibility of sample pre-treatment for viral neutralisation or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested.The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel demonstrated a comparable sensitivity to the WHO recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1000 copies/mL.
32341142, The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity at 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29).
32341142, No cross reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel.The QIAstat-SARS rapid multiplex-PCR panel provides a highly sensitive, robust and accurate assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2.
32341142, This assay allows rapid decisions even in non-PCR trained laboratory or point-of-care testing, allowing innovative organisation.Copyright © 2020 Visseaux et al.
32341111, Whereas hypoxaemia is the marker of severity, different strategies of management should be customised to five specific individual phenotypes.
32341111, Many intubated patients present with phenotype 4, characterised by pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, being associated with severe hypoxaemia with "normal" (>40 mL·cmH2O-1) lung compliance and likely representing pulmonary microvascular thrombosis.
32341111, Phenotype 5 is often associated with high plasma procalcitonin and has low pulmonary compliance, Which is a result of co-infection or acute lung injury after noninvasive ventilation.
32341111, Identifying these clinical phenotypes and applying a personalised approach would benefit the optimisation of therapies and improve outcomes.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32341103, While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favor a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV-axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited.Proposed interventions for SARS-CoV-2 predominantly focus on viral microbiology and aim to inhibit viral cellular injury.
32341103, While these therapies are promising, immediate use may not be feasible, and the time window of their efficacy remains a major unanswered question.
32341103, An alternative approach is the modulation of the specific downstream pathophysiologic effects caused by virus that lead to morbidity and mortality.
32341103, We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV-axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.Copyright ©ERS 2020.
32341078, COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were positive for the three patients.The patients were transferred to the COVID-19 centre for disease control at Montpellier University Hospital.
32341078, As of 29 March 2020, two of those patients are still intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the third was discharged home.COVID-19 infections may present as an acute abdominal pain.

32340654,The COVID-19 pandemic presents many medical and social issues for older people.
32340654, Presented here is a range of information arising from related areas that have impact upon the safety and efficacy of drug therapy in the context of COVID-19.
32340654, Issues include pharmacy practice, clinical therapeutics, and possible new treatments for the virus.
32340654, More information will be published in coming issues of The Senior Care Pharmacist.
32340614,The aim of this document is to provide general guidance and specific recommendations on the practice of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32340614, There are two major considerations.
32340614, First, continued urgent and semi-urgent care for the patients who have no known active COVID-19 should be provided in a safe manner for both patients and staff.
32340614, Second, when necessary, CMR on patients with confirmed or suspected active COVID-19 should focus on the specific clinical question with an emphasis on myocardial function and tissue characterization while optimizing patient and staff safety.
32340588, Preprint manuscripts and popular media articles provided background information and illustrative examples.Included manuscripts were identified via searches using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, while organizational guidelines and popular media articles were identified using Google search queries.
32340588, Practice guidelines were developed via consensus among all authors based on peer-reviewed manuscripts and national or international health care association guidelines.
32340588, Strict objective criteria for inclusion were not used due to the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and a paucity of rigorous empirical evidence.In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care must be judiciously allocated to treat the most severe conditions while minimizing the risk of long-term sequelae and ensuring patient, physician, and health care worker safety.The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short- and long-term impact on health care worldwide.
32340588, Although the full repercussions of this disease have yet to be realized, the outlined recommendations will guide otolaryngologists in the treatment of pediatric patients in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis.
32340539, Additionally, a recent publication by Stanford University has drawn attention to the risks that otolaryngologists may face with regard to manipulation of the upper airway and mucosal disruption.
32340539, As a result of COVID-19 recommendations, multiple institutions have overhauled resident clinical rotations and resident education.
32340539, The result has been a rapid and significant change in resident education at most academic institutions.
32340539, This commentary outlines the development of the otolaryngology resident education consortiums, with implications for future education within and outside of otolaryngology.
32340216, Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health.
32340096, Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension.
32340096, Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is required with more COVID-19 patients..
32340095, Conclusions: The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes.
32340095, The severe cases were mainly occurred in populations at high risk.
32340095, In the epidemic period, classified management of COVID-19 cases should be promoted according to needs for control and prevention of isolation and treatment for the purpose of rational allocation of medical resources.
32340092,Based on systematic review of the role of clinical treatment, disease control and scientific research, and combining with the problems exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic, suggestions were proposed to reform and improve the prevention and treatment system for major epidemics diseases in China.
32340092, In clinical treatment, it is necessary to enhance clinical staff's awareness of law-based reporting, capabilities of syndromic surveillance, the use of infectious diseases reporting systems, and to improve national or local monitoring platforms for emerging infectious diseases detection.
32340092, In terms of disease control, it is important to provide authorities to disease control departments through laws and regulations, improve the quantity and quality of related human resources, and strengthen the applied research and technical readiness targeted infections disease prevention, control and emergency preparedness.
32340092, As for scientific research in major epidemic response, it is essential to strengthen research projects guided by national requests, build research institutions that can "make a final decision", establish national and regional key laboratories, and strengthen strategic technical reserve for emergency disease control and treatment.
32340089, Conclusion: The death of COVID-19 occursmainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases.
32340089, Spleen maybe one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19.
32340089, T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly.
32340089, And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.
32339971, Several methods of using disposable drapes for various procedures are described, with the goal of constructing a tent around the patient to decrease widespread contamination of dispersed droplets and generated aerosol.
32339971, The concepts presented herein are translatable to future situations where aerosol generating procedures increase risk for any pathogenic exposure.

32339832, It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission.
32339832, Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19.
32339832, Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32339394,With the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been suddenly confronted with the difficulty of treatment provision and continuation of clinical trials without face-to-face contact.
32339394, This predicament has resulted in the rapid adoption of telehealth methodologies.1 Clinicians and researchers focused on obesity management have an additional need-- a remote way to measure weight.
32339394, In this piece, we will describe electronic scales (e-scales) and provide guidance on how clinicians/researchers might best implement e-scales in their clinical practice or research studies to remotely measure weight.This article is protected by copyright.

32339391, This may significantly increase the severity of the local response to COVID-19 in the lung.
32339391, To reduce the severity and mortality with COVID-19, we propose to probe for the clinical response to thiazolidinediones (TZDs), PPARγ agonists, that are the well-known anti-diabetic drugs.
32339391, TZDs are able to stabilize lipofibroblasts in their "inactive" state, preventing the transition to myofibroblasts and thereby reducing the development of pulmonary fibrosis and stimulating its resolution.This article is protected by copyright.

32339382, An elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in eight cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection.
32339382, Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases: of these, 7/19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and 4/19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit.
32339382, Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the postpartum period: their newborns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection.
32339382, In one case, a newborn had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery.Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.This study suggests that vaginal delivery may be associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.© 2020 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
32339344, Usual clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection include fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, dry cough, dyspnea that may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (1).
32339344, Skin symptoms of COVID-19 have been poorly described but may include erythematous rash, urticaria and chicken pox like lesions (2-7).

32339248, Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40).
32339248, The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]).
32339248, Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
32339248, These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.

32339221, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC.
32339221, Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated.
32339221, Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported.
32339221, If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.Copyright © 2020 American Society of Hematology.
32339082, Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.
32338767, This observational study describes the prevalence of their (1) second jobs, and (2) unpaid care work for dependent children and/or adult relatives (double- and triple-duty caregiving) overall and by occupational group (registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], or certified nursing assistants [CNAs]).A descriptive secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study.Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States.A subset of 958 essential facility-based LTC workers involved in direct patient care.We present information on LTC workers' demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double- or triple-duty caregiving roles.Most LTC workers were CNAs, followed by LPNs and RNs.
32338767, Overall, more than 70% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with this statement: "When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work." One-sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and more than 60% held double- or triple-duty caregiving roles.
32338767, Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among CNAs.LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double- and triple-duty caregiving roles.
32338767, To slow the spread of COVID-19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.© 2020 The American Geriatrics Society.
32338566, A daily clinical research team huddle that flexibly accommodated virtual participation was also feasibly implemented.Conclusions: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies can be feasibly integrated into ongoing clinical interventions during the pandemic.
32338566, Routine, proactive clinical and research team communication that transparently addresses ethical tensions and health-sustaining activities may promote well-being for providers grappling with rapidly evolving pandemic directives.
32338566, Proactive assessments of individual provider vulnerabilities for severe COVID-19 related respiratory illness may also be a crucial element of the health care system pandemic responses.
32338400, We present this Virtual Issue as a resource for the eating disorder community to showcase research published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders that provides information on effective strategies to help address the challenges arising from COVID-19-related disruptions.
32338400, Articles included describe original research or systematic reviews on obstacles to health services use and strategies to improve access to care; technological tools to provide or enhance interventions; patients' and clinicians' attitudes or perspectives on using digital tools for clinical care; factors influencing therapeutic alliance; and ideas for improving reach and uptake of digital interventions.
32338400, We hope that readers will find ways to observe and record their own experiences during this global crisis; the experiences of people at risk for developing or exhibiting an eating disorder; and the experiences of those who care for people with an eating disorder.
32338400, These lived experiences will be invaluable in formulating hypotheses for future studies in service of advancing the understanding of eating disorders and improving interventions and policies for reducing the burden of suffering attributable to eating disorders.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32338347, Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present.
32338347, An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel.
32338347, To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised.
32338347, As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.
32338254, As of April 5, 2020, 1.218.474 cases were confirmed with 65.884 deaths worldwide (1).
32338254, The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 range from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia.
32338254, In a study of 7,736 Covid-19 patients in China, of all the clinical symptoms, hyposmia was not reported in any patient(2).
32338254, Anyway, it is now clear that olfactory dysfunction may also be present in these patients(3) as the only or prevalent manifestation(4).
32338224, Contemporarily, Danser and associates [51] claim that there is no evidence to stop RAS blockers in the course of COVID-19 infection.
32338224, In fact, there are no available data which support that ACE inhibitors or ANG II type I receptor blockers increase COVID-19 infection via its binding to ACE2.
32338224, Finally, Kuster and associates [52] write that there are no data on the strict relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV2 mortality.
32338224, Moreover, in the SARSCoV2, cells expressing ACE2 were not attacked by the virus, while cells lacking ACE2 were bound by the SARS-CoV2 virus [53]. These findings suggest that also in the case of RES effects on COVID-19 infection, the dual role of ACE2 should be taken into serious consideration.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.
32338164, Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
32338164, There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
32338164, The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19.
32338164, The compounds 2 and 3 may tightly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and so may be successful in the treatment of COVID-19.
32338155,The current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls urgently for effective therapies.
32338155, Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32338155, However, there are public concerns and disputes about both the safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ for this new application.
32338155, Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse opinions on this urgent topic.
32337859, He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history.
32337859, During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin.
32337859, These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course.

32337790, The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options.
32337790, However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.
32337790, With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.© 2020 The Authors.

32336243, The origin of the virus is unknown.
32336243, Airway manipulations and intubations, which are common during anesthesia procedures may increasingly expose anesthesia providers and intensive care unit team members to SARS-CoV-2.
32336243, Through a comprehensive review of existing studies on COVID-19, this article presents the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, reviews current medical management, and suggests ways to improve the safety of anesthetic procedures.
32336243, Owing to the highly contagious nature of the virus and the lack of therapeutic drugs or vaccines, precautions should be taken to prevent medical staff from COVID-19.
32336069, Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases.
32336069, So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID‑19 are limited.
32336069, Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists.
32336069, Thus, it is important to know typical COVID‑19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.
32335900, Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq™; 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively.
32335900, Videolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used.
32335900, Anaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group.

32335585, Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment.
32335585, Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.
32335585, This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19.
32335585, Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-2.
32335561, We are facing a new virus, so several antiviral agents previously used to treat other coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS are being considered as the first potential candidates to treat COVID-19.
32335561, Thus, several agents have been used by the beginning of the current outbreak in China first and all over the word successively, as reported in several different guidelines and therapeutic recommendations.
32335561, At the same time, a great number of clinical trials have been launched to investigate the potential efficacy therapies for COVID-19 highlighting the urgent need to get as quickly as possible high-quality evidence.
32335561, Through PubMed, we explored the relevant articles published on treatment of COVID-19 and on trials ongoing up to April 15, 2020.
32335560, As of now, there is no known effective pharmaceutical agent against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32335560, However, several precautionary measures have been prescribed to prevent further spread of the virus, which include avoidance of social gatherings, proper handwashing, frequently disinfecting of used items and surfaces and so on.
32335560, More recent studies have highlighted the possibility of treating patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, of which mechanism of action is not completely understood.
32335560, We seek to draw the attention of the scientific community to the possibility of drastically reducing the effects of the virus on the affected patients and improving clinical trials outcome through the synergistic action of zinc and chloroquine in patients suffering from the coronavirus disease.
32335456, We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity.
32335456, Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk-benefit judgement of the clinician.
32335456, Whether our hypothesis is clinically applicable and successful in decreasing viral infection will be evaluated for further studies.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32335334, As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation.
32335334, We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome.
32335334, We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.Copyright © 2020.

32333196,As we know more about the clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, which is now accepted as a pandemic, many questions have been raised about how to manage and monitor the treatment of cancer patients.
32333196, It was determined that the incidence of lymphopenia increased in COVID-19 and there was a significant relationship between lymphopenia and mortality.
32333196, This can be thought of as an unresponsive problem in how to maintain anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32333196, This article was written for a hypothetical approach in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to be an idea of collecting data for treatment with anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32332516, However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs.
32332516, In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles.
32332516, Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission.
32332516, As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis.
32332481, After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation.
32332481, A task force performs home visits to infected individuals.
32332481, Persons under investigation (PUIs) can stay in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days or in special circumstances can be quarantined at home.
32332481, This community-based approach involved all stakeholders including local public health departments, public safety authorities, neighborhood councils, and community health centers.
32332185, Our hospital lies at the epicentre of the Belgian epidemic.
32332185, On April 1st, a total of 235 Covid-19 patients had been admitted to our hospital.
32332185, This demanded an unprecedented adaptation of our hospital organisation, and we have met many clinical issues in the care for Covid-19 patients.
32332185, In this article, we share our experience in the handling of some of the practical and organisational issues in the care for Covid-19 patients.
32332061, All three assays showed 100% negative percent agreement (NPA).
32332061, In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen (∼17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress (∼46 minutes) and the ePlex (∼1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance.
32332061, The ePlex had the longest time to results and showed a slight improvement in PPA over the ID NOW.
32332061, Information about the clinical and analytical performance of these assays, as well as workflow, will be critical in making informed and timely decisions on testing platform.Copyright © 2020 Zhen et al.

32331519, His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis.
32331519, Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative.
32331519, The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days.Our patient improved significantly.
32331519, This and other COVID-19 cases are urgently demanding results from clinical trials that support evidence-based therapeutical approaches to this pandemic and the clinical management of patients, especially those at critical care.
32331343, Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy.
32331343, In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition.
32331343, Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies.
32331343, Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.
32331217, It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability.
32331217, However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls.
32331217, It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation.
32331217, Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.

32330356,With the rapidly expanding pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, there is concern that solid organ transplant recipients will be particularly vulnerable to infection and may experience a more severe clinical course.
32330356, We report four cases of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients including recipients of kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplants.
32330356, We describe each patient's medical history including transplantation history, their clinical presentation and workup, and their course from diagnosis to either hospital discharge or to improvement in symptoms.

32330343, Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required non-rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids.
32330343, Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged.
32330343, In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID-19 appear to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to undercounting of mild/asymptomatic cases.

32330313, Lumbar anesthesia for cesarean section was performed and a female baby was delivered uneventfully, with the Apgar score of 9 to 10 points.
32330313, Three times of COVID-19 nucleic acid test for the baby was negative after delivery.
32330313, The puerpera returned to normal after the operation and two times of throat swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were all negative after antiviral therapy.
32330313, We reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 pregnant woman with detailed clinical information and our result indicated that for late pregnant women with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, there might be no intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32330305, The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (No.
32330305, NCT04279782, 19 February, 2020).SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in all four specimen types, though not all specimen types were positive simultaneously.
32330305, The presence of viral RNA was not necessarily predictive of clinical symptoms, for example, the presence of viral RNA in the urine did not necessarily predict urinary tract symptoms.SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple systems, including the urinary tract.
32330305, Testing different specimen types may be useful for monitoring disease changes and progression, and for establishing a prognosis.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32330303, Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed.
32330303, Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response.
32330303, The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method.
32330303, A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32330297, However, further studies are needed to address how large these groups can be, without losing sensitivity on the RT-PCR.
32330297, The strategy best works in settings with a low prevalence of positive tests.
32330297, It is best implemented in subgroups with low clinical suspicion.
32330297, The model can be adapted to specific prevalences, generating a tailored to the context implementation of the pool testing strategy.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32330293, In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course.

32330288, Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection.
32330288, Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions.
32330288, Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice.

32330277, Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40).
32330277, The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]).
32330277, Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
32330277, These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.
32330209, Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible-or the virus may cause a serious pandemic.
32330209, Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus.
32330209, In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.© The Author(s) 2020.

32330073, One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open access medicine is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).
32330073, Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness, pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide, should be considered for COVID-19.
32330073, Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent.
32330073, While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.
32329978, Advanced age, comorbidities (most commonly hypertension), higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher C‑reactive protein level, D‑dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of COVID‑19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level.
32329978, Multivariable regress ion showed increasing odds of severe COVID‑19 associated with higher SOFA score (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.302-4.608; P = 0.005), and lymphocyte count less than 0.8 × 109/l (OR, 9.017; 95% CI, 2.808-28.857; P <0.001) on admission.
32329978, Higher SOFA score (OR, 2.402; 95% CI, 1.313-4.395; P = 0.004) on admission was identified as risk factor for in‑hospital death.Lymphocytopenia and a higher SOFA score on admission could help clinicians to identify patients at high risk for developing severe COVID‑19.
32329978, More related studies are needed in the future.
32329926, As an aerosol-generating procedure, tracheostomy increases the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19 infection.
32329926, Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care.This study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways.
32329926, Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID-19 were derived by consensus and available evidence.Modified guidelines for all phases of tracheostomy care at an academic tertiary care center in the setting of COVID-19 are presented.During the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians must carefully consider the indications, procedural precautions, and postoperative care for tracheostomies.

32329923, Two institutions stopped free-flap surgery with the remaining scheduling surgery by committee review.
32329923, Factors contributing to reduced clinical volume included lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) (35%) and lack of rapid COVID-19 testing (86%).The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in HNC care.
32329923, Rapid COVID-19 testing and correlation with infectious potential remain paramount to resuming the care of patients with head and neck cancer.

32329921, In this study, we discuss consensus recommendations pertaining to care of SMA patients during the pandemic.
32329921, We highlight that SMA treatments should not be perceived as elective.
32329921, Decisions regarding the delay of treatments should be made with consideration of the potential risks of COVID-19 exposure and the risk of that delay.
32329921, We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and healthcare provider, considering any geographic- or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32329877, However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2.
32329877, Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
32329877, Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.
32329877, Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.
32329756, Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air.
32329756, Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro.
32329756, In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure.
32329756, Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.
32329659,Concerns about the prevention and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as it is crucial in contagious epidemics that travel and transfer of the patients be minimal for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups.
32329659, Telemedicine or telehealth can play an important role, especially with previous successful experiences in the management of acute infectious respiratory epidemics such as SARS and MERS.
32329659, In order to better control the rapid spread of coronavirus and manage the COVID-19 crisis, both developed and developing countries can improve the efficiency of their health system by replacing a proportion of face-to-face clinical encounters with telehealth.
32329659, Recent technological advancement facilitates this reform, but there is a need for national or state-wide rules and regulations to be adapted accordingly.
32329520, Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds.
32329520, Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway.

32329044,Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system.
32329044, Seven types of coronavirus can infect humans.Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies.
32329044, The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus).
32329044, Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Future epidemiological studies and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.
32329026, A matter of debate is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets.
32329026, Thus, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with confirmed COVID-19.A 31-year-old man with fever, myalgia, anosmia, and ageusia was tested and found positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a pharyngeal swab.
32329026, Eight days after he provided semen and urine samples in which viral RNA presence was measured using a Real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting E and S viral genes.Semen and urine samples search for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative.
32329026, Although this should be interpreted cautiously, it may be possible that either the viral clearance kinetics in these matrices matches the progressive clinical recovery of the patient or that the virus was never present in these fluids at the time of the laboratory diagnosis.
32328954, Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality.
32328954, Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged.
32328954, However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city.
32328954, The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.
32328757, These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms.
32328757, Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible.
32328757, In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring.Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need.
32328757, The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.
32328595, This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors.
32328595, The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
32328595, The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects.
32328595, This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics.Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.
32328588,A 67-year-old female presented with upper respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19.
32328588, She was found to have a large hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade and mild left ventricular impairment.
32328588, Clinical course was complicated by development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
32328588, She was treated with pericardiocentesis, colchicine, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine with improvement in symptoms.© 2020 Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American College of Cardiology Foundation.
32328406, As of April 2020, no vaccine is commercially available for these coronavirus strains.
32328406, Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from the vaccine development efforts for MERS and SARS can be of high value for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).
32328406, Here, we review the past and ongoing vaccine development efforts for clinically relevant coronavirus strains with the intention that this information helps in the development of effective and safe vaccines for COVID-19.
32328406, In addition, information from naturally exposed individuals and animal models to coronavirus strains is described for the same purpose of helping into the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2020.
32328367, As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health.
32328367, This review will introduce a general overview of coronavirus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32328367, It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pandemic.
32328367, Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counseling of patients worldwide.Copyright © 2020, Hassan et al.
32327758,We investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism by surveying expression of viral entry-associated genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues from healthy human donors.
32327758, We co-detected these transcripts in specific respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32327758, These genes are co-expressed in nasal epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells' potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance.
32327758, The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and user-friendly fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org.
32327757, Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens.
32327757, These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2.
32327757, Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness.
32327757, Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.
32327490, The first was "How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic?" The second was "What general advice should we give to people with epilepsy during this crisis? Authors individually scored statements on a scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to +10 (strongly agree). 5/11 recommendations for physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all authors as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating.
32327490, Subsequently, a tele-conference was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were revised.After revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or above.
32327490, The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication.
32327490, We also provide helpful links to additional helpful information for people with epilepsy and health providers.These recommendation may help healthcare professionals provide optimal care to people with epilepsy during the coronavirus pandemic.© 2020 American Academy of Neurology.
32327405,As the UK shields 'high risk' patients and enforces social distancing measures, patients will be at risk of significantly reducing physical activity levels.
32327405, We explore the evidence base for COVID-19-specific recommendations and exercise interventions to 'precondition' patients prior to infection and appraise the role of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) as a risk-stratifying triage tool.
32327405, We conclude that structured exercise programmes can be used to maintain physical activity levels and prevent deconditioning and that VO2 max has the potential to be used as a clinically relevant triage tool during the COVID-19 outbreak.© Royal College of Physicians 2020.

32327397, For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80-7.87).
32327397, For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ.HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data.
32327397, However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32327229, Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n=83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n=29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n=44, 47.3%), the crazy-paving sign (n=34, 36.6%), the sieve-hole sign (n=12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n=21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n=8, 8.6%).
32327229, Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazy-paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common-type infections (p<0.05).
32327229, Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections.The CT and clinical appearances of COVID-19 are variable and reflect the severity of COVID-19 to some extent.Copyright © 2020.

32326943, The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is new to humans, and only limited scientific evidence is available to identify the impact of the disease COVID-19 on SRH, including clinical presentation and outcomes of the infection during pregnancy, or for persons with STI/HIV-related immunosuppression.
32326943, Beyond the clinical scope of SRH, we should not neglect the impacts at the health system level and disruptions or interruptions in regular provision of SRH services, such as pre- and postnatal checks, safe abortion, contraception, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections.
32326943, Furthermore, other aspects merit attention such as the potential increase of gender-based violence and domestic abuse, and effects of stigma and discrimination associated with COVID-19 and their effects on SRH clients and health care providers.
32326943, Therefore, there is an urgent need for the scientific community to generate sound clinical, epidemiological, and psycho-social behavioral links between COVID-19 and SRH and rights outcomes.
32326602, Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32326602, This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19.
32326602, In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection.
32326602, Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32326509, The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration.
32326509, We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT.
32326509, The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis.
32326509, To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.
32326426,Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents, the oral cavity is directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations.
32326426, Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission.
32326426, If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.
32326426, We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of βCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.
32325767, While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2.
32325767, Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy.
32325767, Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
32325767, Given that several currently marketed drugs may be efficient therapeutic agents for severe COVID-19 cases, they may be beneficial for future viral pandemics and other infections caused by RNA viruses when standard treatments are unavailable.
32325642, The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 μL reaction.
32325642, To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples.
32325642, The SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay showed perfect agreement in detection with the RT-qPCR assay.
32325642, The newly-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is a simple and rapid method for COVID-19 surveillance.
32324898, There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization.
32324898, Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60-6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02-4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients.
32324898, Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period.
32324898, Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in the clinic.© 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2020 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.
32324653, However, if one opts to use the term "COVID-19" in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language.
32324653, In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide.
32324653, Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach.
32324653, The goal of this expert consensus is to help radiologists recognize findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and aid their communication with other healthcare providers, assisting management of patients during this pandemic.
32324640,In this Invited Commentary, the author considers the February 2020 announcement that scoring on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 will change to pass/fail no sooner than January 2022 and its effects on the transition to residency process in the context of both the recommendations of the Invitational Conference on USMLE Scoring (InCUS) held in March 2019 and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020.
32324640, The author suggests that the medical education community must embrace any positive changes that come about as a result of the pandemic while continuing to systematically review the strengths and areas for improvement in the current transition to residency process.In its recommendations, InCUS provided a thoughtful set of action priorities and an effective process to work together, which can inform and guide the work ahead.
32324640, The COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the educational and clinical environments and is now the biggest disruptor in all aspects of life, not just medical education.
32324640, It is the responsibility of leaders in medical education to have a vision for and then implement an improved continuum of education that maintains the core values of the field and fits the health care delivery needs of today and the future.
32324622,The COVID-19 crisis is a global pandemic of a novel infectious disease with far-ranging public health implications.
32324622, With regard to cardiac electrophysiology (EP) services, we discuss the "real-world" challenges and solutions that have been essential for efficient and successful (i) ramping down of standard clinical practice patterns and (ii) pivoting of workflow processes to meet the demands of this pandemic.
32324622, The aims of these recommendations are to outline: (1) essential practical steps to approaching procedures, as well as outpatient and inpatient care of EP patients, with relevant examples, (2) successful strategies to minimize exposure risk to patients and clinical staff while also balancing resource utilization, (3) challenges related to redeployment and restructuring of clinical and support staff, and (4) considerations regarding continued collaboration with clinical and administrative colleagues in order to implement these changes.
32324622, While process changes will vary across practices and hospital systems, we believe that these experiences from four different EP sections in a large New York city hospital network currently based in the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic will prove useful for other EP practices adapting their own practices in preparation for local surges.
32324451, There is a need for medical and scientific expertise to clinically and sociologically contextualize and interpret diagnostic tests as well as drugs and vaccines that will be deployed in the coming months as part of the planetary collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32324451, In a time of pandemic and facing a novel infectious pathogen, health care workers are in need of planetary scale consultation and support.
32324451, Even creating a small consultation network using mobile applications might offer improved health outcomes.
32324451, The Internet of Things and digital health ought to be considered in concert with telemedicine as part of an effective pandemic response.
32324359, In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality.
32324359, The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care.
32324359, It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries.

32324358, The processed articles emphasize that during interventions in the head and neck region, especially when using rotating instruments, it is of utmost importance for all personnel being present at the time of intervention to wear full protection, including disposable medical uniforms, glasses and special masks.
32324358, These single-use items have to be changed after each intervention and the whole team has to be educated for this process in advance.
32324358, In order to avoid cross-contamination and infection of personnel during intervention, it is essential to keep all work-safety and infection-control precautions extremely strictly.

32324209, The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs.
32324209, The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34).
32324209, Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs.This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients.
32324209, These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32323974, A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples.
32323974, We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
32323974, One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR.
32323974, Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.
32323908, Our history of agility in learning and teaching is now only inhibited by the time constraints of current clinical demands on the genetics community.
32323908, This publication is designed to offer ideas and resources for quickly transitioning our education to meet the current demands in the time of a pandemic.
32323908, Not only will this allow us to continue our strong history of education, it will enhance our strong commitment to using modern educational techniques and tools to address the genetics workforce issues that have defined the recent past.
32323908, We have the opportunity to aggressively educate for trainees that now have the capacity to learn, and to lead the way in showing how the genetics community rallies together no matter the challenge.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32323646, Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses.
32323646, Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations.
32323646, Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts.
32323646, Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.
32322993, Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019.
32322993, For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent.
32322993, In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe.
32322993, As a result of the current importance of coronaviruses in global public health, we conducted a review to summarize and update, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of the three major diseases in humans caused by coronaviral infection.
32322402, Clinical trials are currently underway.
32322402, In vitro tests are also being conducted to assess the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of this epidemic, which is considered a pandemic by the WHO.
32322402, We note that the content of this review is dated.
32322402, The information it contains is subject to change and modification as the epidemic progresses.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32322401, To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc.
32322401, No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet.
32322401, However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.
32322401, In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32322146, During viral pandemics, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise the application of airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures, such as aerosolized medications.Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including fit-tested particulate respirators should be worn when administering nebulized medications to patients.
32322146, These PPEs have been in short supply in the US during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is increasing the risk faced by health care workers (HCWs) who are treating patients using aerosolized medications.
32322146, Despite taking appropriate precautions, HCWs are becoming infected with COVID-19.
32322146, This may be related to secondary exposure related to viral longevity in fugitive emissions and viability on fomites.We have expanded on non-US public health recommendations to provide guidance to frontline HCWs to enhance collaboration between clinicians, who are often siloed in their clinical practices, and ultimately to protect the federal workforce, which cannot sustain a significant loss of frontline HCWs.Copyright © 2020 Frontline Medical Communications Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA.
32322107, For this purpose, the available literature on cases of infection in pregnancy during the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003, the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic ongoing since 2012, as well as recent publications on cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are reviewed and reported.
32322107, Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate.
32322107, It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely.
32322107, Breastfeeding is possible once infection has been excluded or the disease declared cured.
32321904, At present, China's measures for managing asymptomatic carriers are 14 days of centralized quarantine and observation; in principle, people with two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests (at an interval of at least 24 hours) can be released from quarantine.
32321904, However, asymptomatic carriers will not be included in confirmed cases unless they develop clinical manifestations while in quarantine.
32321904, As "silent spreaders", asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.
32321904, The testing and follow-up of asymptomatic carriers should be expanded to include people in close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19 and asymptomatic cases, clusters of outbreaks, and key areas and populations with a high risk of infection.
32321903, The medical staff working in the operating room, such as anesthesiologists, surgeons and nurses, are at high risk of exposure to virus due to closely contacting patients.
32321903, The perioperative management is under great challenge while performing surgeries for patients suffering COVID-19, including emergency cesarean section, which is one of the most common surgeries under such circumstances.
32321903, How to prevent medical staff from cross-infection is an issue of great concern.
32321903, In this article, we give a practice of anesthesia scenario design for emergency cesarean section in a supposed standard patient suffering COVID-19, aimed to optimize the work flow and implement the protective details through simulation of a real operation scenario, which may be useful for training and clinical practice of anesthesia management for patients suffering COVID-19 or other fulminating infectious diseases.
32321878, In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy.
32321878, Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β).
32321878, This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response.
32321878, In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 involves inhibition of host GSK3β.
32321116, The report emphasizes on the clinical presentations of the disease and ventilatory support in pediatric patients with COVID-19.
32321116, It establishes a flowchart to guide health practitioners on triaging critical cases.
32321116, COVID-19 is essentially an unknown clinical condition for the majority of pediatric intensive care professionals.
32321116, Guidelines developed by experts can help all practitioners standardize their attitudes and improve the treatment of COVID-19.
32320852, In the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being a new virus, there are already drugs suggested as active in in vitro assays that are being repurposed in clinical trials.
32320852, Promising SARS-CoV-2 viral targets and computational approaches are described and discussed.
32320852, Here, we propose, based on open antiviral drug discovery approaches for previous outbreaks, that there could still be gaps in our approach to drug discovery.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32320677, Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza.
32320677, SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes.
32320677, Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32320478, Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients.
32320478, Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression.
32320478, Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19.
32320478, We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.© 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2020 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.
32320477, As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient.
32320477, Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses.

32320375, Emerging infectious diseases by their nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic-treatment-control nexus, and push our concepts of causality beyond the limits of the conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology.
32320375, We need to use contemporary methods of assessing causality to ensure that clinical, laboratory and public health measures draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation.
32320375, The purpose of any aetiological hypothesis is to derive actionable insights into this latest emerging infectious disease.
32320375, This review is an introduction to a conversation with medical microbiologists, which will be supported by a moderated blog.
32320066, Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid.
32320066, Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients.
32320066, All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32320066, In the absence of potential interventions for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to control the spread of this disease.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32320059, The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough cautiousness.

32320004, Among the included articles, there was only 1 case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant.
32320004, No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years.
32320004, Available data about therapies were limited.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32320004, The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.
32320003, Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3).
32320003, A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period.
32320003, The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients.
32320003, Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.
32319446, In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19.
32319446, Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention.
32319446, We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities.
32319446, An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.
32319444, The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status.
32319444, Consequently the first come-first served rule to ICU admission should not be applied.
32319444, The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life.
32319444, Finally particular attention should be paid to the bereavement management of the family/caregivers and in the right approach of psychological problems and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of health workers involved in the pandemia.
32319443, In the current context of international public health emergency caused by the CoViD-19 epidemic, this work aims to explain the ethical, deontological and legal bases of the SIAARTI Document and to propose methodologic and argumentative integrations that are useful for understanding and placing in context the decision-making criteria proposed.
32319443, The working group that contributed to the drafting of this paper agrees that it is appropriate that healthcare personnel, who is particularly committed to taking care of those who are currently in need of intensive or sub-intensive care, should benefit from clear operational indications that are useful to orient care and, at the same time, that the population should know in advance which criteria will guide the tragic choices that may fall on each one of us.
32319443, This contribution therefore firstly reflects on the appropriateness of the SIAARTI standpoint and the objectives of the SIAARTI Document.
32319443, It then turns to demonstrate how the recommendations it proposes can be framed within a shared interdisciplinary, ethical, deontological and legal perspective.
32319435,A position statement published by the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) is fostering a vibrant debate, crossed by deep fears.
32319435, These are recommendations addressed to ICU doctors who must decide whether to implement intensive treatments for patients who need them to survive.
32319435, Specifically, the reference is to the patients to whom the CoViD-19 epidemic has compromised respiratory capacity.
32319435, We still do not have clear what positive criteria can help make clinical decisions in contexts of insufficient resources that force us to make choices.
32319433, However, several clinical centres decided to use off label drugs as a standard of care in the absence of efficacy and safety data.
32319433, The national regulatory body (AIFA) has set up a process in a short time to transparently govern the approval of new trials and to regulate the use of medicines that are not indicated.
32319433, In this context, the communication of risk associated with experimental therapies was also very important.
32319433, The lessons we will learn from this emergency may result crucial in redesigning a better way of conducting clinical trials and information on drugs.
32319218, The CT-scan confirmed an interstitial pneumonia.
32319218, The patient received an antiviral therapy with hydroxychloroquine showing no further deterioration of the clinical state.
32319218, After 12 days of hospitalisation the patient was released SARS-CoV-2 negative and completely asymptomatic.This article is protected by copyright.

32319131, At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32319131, Apart from massive testing of personnel in pre-defined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them.

32317557, As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital.
32317557, Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32317557, Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.
32317557, These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.
32317434, Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded.
32317434, A large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients.
32317434, Most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the COVID-19 related restrictions.

32317050, The number of articles published per day increased rapidly until the end of January.ConclusionThe number of articles on COVID-19 steadily increased before 6 February 2020.
32317050, However, they lack diversity and are almost non-existent in some study fields, such as clinical research.
32317050, The findings suggest that evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies will be improved when more results from clinical research becomes available.
32317038, The program was simultaneously approved for funding by the 6 regional health foundations and launched within 1 week of conception.
32317038, Residents of Alberta can subscribe to the program by texting "COVID19HOPE" to a sort code number.
32317038, Each subscriber receives free daily supportive text messages, for 3 months, crafted by a team of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health therapist, and mental health service users.
32317038, Within 1 week of the launch of Text4Hope, 32 805 subscribers had signed up to the program, and there have been expressions of interests from other jurisdictions to implement a similar program to support the mental health of those in quarantine, isolation, or lockdown.
32316718, The first rapid "living" review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020.A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: "Covid-19", "Coronavirus", "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "rehabilitation", "physical therapy modalities", "exercise", "occupational therapy", and "late complications". Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included.Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review.
32316718, Four of them are "calls for action", 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients.All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic.
32316718, Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home.
32316718, Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in Covid-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.
32316713, SARS-CoV-2 can mainly transmit by droplets or close contact, and is generally susceptible in the crowd.
32316713, Tumor patients are at high risk of this pathogen because of their impaired immune function.
32316713, Identifying tumor patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) early, and understanding its distribution characteristics can help to improve the cure rate of patients, and better control the epidemic and development of SARS-CoV-2 much better.
32316713, With comprehensive analysis of relevant literature, this paper reviews the clinical characteristics of neoplastic patients with COVID-19, and puts forward some suggestions on how to deal with this epidemic.
32316618, Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
32316618, COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
32316618, Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
32316618, The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32316270, One of the options under investigation is the old antimalarial drug, chloroquine, and its analog, hydroxychloroquine.
32316270, Developed as synthetic succedanea of cinchona alkaloids, these chiral antimalarials are currently in use as the racemate.
32316270, Besides the ethical concern related to accelerated large-scale clinical trials of drugs with unproven efficacy, the known potential detrimental cardiac effects of these drugs should also be considered.
32316270, In principle, the safety profile might be ameliorated by using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine single enantiomers in place of the racemate.
32315980, Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response.
32315980, However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19.Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.

32315725, The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively.We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness.
32315725, The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32315725, Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32314274, Our results showed that four of the eight pregnant women were asymptomatic before delivery but became symptomatic post-partum.
32314274, Correspondingly, white blood cell (WBC) counts increased and lymphocyte (LYMPH) counts decreased.
32314274, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum also increased to a higher level than those in general pregnancy.
32314274, Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and CRP, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.
32313886, He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant.
32313886, Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD.

32313885,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32313885, The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32313885, Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.

32312574, The overlap in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment.
32312574, However, identifying features atypical for COVID-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of Computed Tomography Angiography among these patients.
32312574, Hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13% of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among COVID-19 infections.

32312365,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in China and the epidemic is still going on at present.
32312365, Since children are the susceptible population, the number of cases is gradually increasing.
32312365, In addition to the typical respiratory symptoms, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also has the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular system damage.
32312365, Based on a literature review, this article discusses the possible cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children and related mechanisms, in order to provide help for the timely treatment and prevention of cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children.
32312364, All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge.Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
32312364, Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed.
32312364, Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis.
32312364, Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.
32312363, As for clinical symptoms, 29 children (25.2%) had fever, 47 (40.9%) had respiratory symptoms (including cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and 61 (53.0%) were asymptomatic.
32312363, Lung CT findings showed ground glass opacity, fiber opacities, patchy changes, and pulmonary consolidation in 49 children (42.6%), among whom 2 children had "white lung"; 39 children (33.9%) only had lung texture enhancement and 27 children (23.5%) had no pulmonary imaging changes.
32312363, Among the 115 children, 3 were critically ill, among whom 1 had been cured and the other 2 were under continuous treatment.Most of the children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a close contact history.
32312363, Critical cases are rare and there is a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.
32312362, Traffic problems caused by epidemic prevention and control increase the difficulty in the management of children with severe diabetes.
32312362, In order to control the spread of epidemic, children with mild diabetes are advised to be managed at home and in the community.
32312362, However, how to treat children with severe diabetes effectively and safely during the outbreak of COVID-19 brings great challenges to primary doctors.
32312362, The Subspecialty Group of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association and the Subspecialty Group of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Doctor Association have developed the recommendations on the identification and transfer of children with critical diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak, which provide a reference for primary doctors to quickly assess the severity of patient's condition and treat the illness accordingly, thus reducing the risk of referral infection and improving clinical prognosis.
32312158, The widespread impact and chronicity of this pandemic makes it unique from any crisis faced by our training programs to date.
32312158, This international medical crisis has the potential to significantly alter the course of training for our current resident cohort.
32312158, The decrease in clinical opportunities due to the limitations on elective surgical cases and office visits as well as potential resident redeployment could lead to a decline in overall experience as well as key indicator cases.
32312158, It is important that we closely monitor the impact of this pandemic on resident education and ensure the implementation of alternative learning strategies while maintaining an emphasis on safety and well-being.
32312064, For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment.
32312064, For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions.
32312064, Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation.
32312064, Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.
32312025, Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32312025, In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands.
32312025, While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications.
32312025, Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.
32312018, The data of these three aspects will be analyzed synthetically.This study will help us to identify the chest CT features of COVID-19 and its mechanism.This retrospective study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (No. 2020-140).
32312018, Written informed consent will be obtained from all study participants prior to enrollment in the study.
32312018, To protect privacy of participants, all private information were kept anonymous.
32312018, The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be disseminated electronically and in print regardless of results.
32311843, A large number of these patients end up in the intensive care units (ICU) with critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation.
32311843, One of the most important clinical features of the infection is a profound coagulopathy.

32311816, Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury, and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread.
32311816, This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on (a) varied clinical presentations; (b) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; (c) the roles of the emergency department, emergency medical system, and the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL); and (4) regional STEMI systems of care.
32311816, During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI-capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely manner, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room.

32311790, In overall analysis, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.737 to 0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI = 0.541 to 0.813).
32311790, An optimal cutoff of REMS (≥6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged <65 years, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI = 0.743 to 0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI = 0.462 to 0.732).To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32311790, The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially for the patients aged <65 years.
32311790, The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.© 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

32311350, At the time of the report, 3 pregnancies were ongoing; of the remaining 48 pregnant women, 46 gave birth by cesarean delivery, and 2 gave birth vaginally; in this study, 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death were reported.Although vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and neonates has been generally good, the high rate of preterm delivery by cesarean delivery is a reason for concern.
32311350, Cesarean delivery was typically an elective surgical intervention, and it is reasonable to question whether cesarean delivery for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was warranted.

32311318, With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19.
32311318, We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19.
32311318, Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32310921, In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital.
32310921, The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments.
32310921, Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.
32310921, A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.
32310920, Bedside pulmonary ultrasound presents an undeniable series of advantages in patients at high risk of infection, and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient, as well as for home delivery of stabilized patients.
32310920, Chest X-ray is characterized by low sensitivity in identifying earlier lung changes.
32310920, Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative, and in the late phase imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach.
32310920, Echocardiography should be limited to patients with hemodynamic instability.
32310916, The highest mortality rate was detected among patients with both progressively incremental troponin levels and a history of cardiovascular disease.
32310916, Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration.
32310916, In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels.
32310916, In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.
32310915, In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence.
32310915, Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors.
32310915, Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited.
32310915, This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32310815, To date, we have enrolled 159 participants.Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing.
32310815, Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing.

32310621, Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.
32310621, The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
32310621, In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.
32310621, In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
32309809, The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits.
32309809, Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19.
32309809, In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO).
32309809, In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.
32309679,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32309679, The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32309679, Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32309679, Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

32307653, In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release.
32307653, Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients.
32307653, This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair.
32307653, Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation.
32307593,Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originated from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, at the end of 2019, it has become a clinical threat to the general population worldwide.
32307593, Among people infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the intensive management of the critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) needs substantial medical resource.
32307593, In the present article, we have summarized the promising drugs, adjunctive agents, respiratory supportive strategies, as well as circulation management, multiple organ function monitoring and appropriate nutritional strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU based on the previous experience of treating other viral infections and influenza.
32307593, These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19.
32307550, The number of DEGs increased with the disease progress, and decreased after initial treatment.
32307550, All down-regulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved in Th17 cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and T cell activation.
32307550, After initial treatmen in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission.Our findings show a decreased T cell proportion with down-regulated gene expression related to T cell activation and differentiation were occurred in COVID-19 severe patients, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 .© The Author(s) 2020.

32307014, To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%. Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19.
32307014, Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.
32307014, This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention.
32307014, The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.
32306864, Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases.
32306864, On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers.
32306864, The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period.
32306864, Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design.
32306853, This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV).
32306853, Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR.
32306853, Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.
32306853, In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.
32306836, Computer simulation is particularly suitable to complement experiments to elucidate conformational changes at the molecular level which are related to inhibition process of the COVID-19.
32306836, Therefore, computational simulation is essential tool to elucidate the phenomenon.
32306836, The structure-based virtual screening computational approach will be used to filter the best drugs from the literature, the investigate the structural variation of COVID-19 with the interaction of the best inhibitor is a fundamental step to design new drugs and vaccines which can combat the coronavirus.
32306836, This mini-review will address novel coronavirus structure, mechanism of action, and trial test of antiviral drugs in the lab and patients with COVID-19.
32306822, MD simulations were also performed on the PDB structure 6YF2F to understand the differences between screened molecules and co-crystallized ligand.
32306822, We screened 300 potential compounds from various databases, and 66 potential compounds from FDA approved drugs.
32306822, Cobicistat, ritonavir, lopinavir, and darunavir are in the top screened molecules from FDA approved drugs.
32306822, The screened drugs and molecules may be helpful in fighting with SARS-CoV-2 after further studies.
32306657, Conclusion: Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low.
32306513, The compliance was excellent, significant improvements were observed after only 3 months of treatment, without adverse effects.
32306513, During follow-up, the COVID-19 pandemic address concern on the possible increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression.

32306492, Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level.A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study.
32306492, The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 µg/ml with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer≥2.0 µg/ml, and 267 patients with D-dimer <2.0 µg/ml on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization.
32306492, Patients with D-dimer levels≥2.0 µg/ml had a higher incidence of mortality when comparing to those who with D-dimer levels < 2.0 µg/ml (12/67 vs 1/267, P<0.001, HR:51.5, 95%CI:12.9-206.7).D-dimer on admission greater than 2.0µg/mL (fourfold increase) could effectively predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19, which indicated D-dimer could be an early and helpful marker to improve management of Covid-19 patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32306491, Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction.
32306491, In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels.
32306491, With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients.
32306491, Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice.While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32306452, The absence of protective role of ACE2 leads to dysregulated RAS and thus acute changes under multiple pathological scenarios including SARS.
32306452, This potentially shared mechanism may also be the molecular explanation for pathogenesis driven by SARS-CoV-2.
32306452, We reasonably speculate several potential directions of clinical management including host-directed therapies aiming to restore dysregulated RAS caused by ACE2 deficiency.

32306288, In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.
32306166,This review based on the actual results of epidemic prevention management in radiology departments in epidemic areas, and using designated hospital management methods, to summarize the radiology protection system.
32306166, With the cooperation of the whole hospital and radiology department, a number of effective evaluation methods have been carried out to ensure the optimization of clinical protection.
32306166, These practical methods provide a basis for the further promotion of management strategies and reduction of nosocomial infection.
32306166, To our knowledge, the establishment of standardized protection and clear process has opened up a new idea of epidemic prevention management, which can effectively provide timely, efficient, and accurate support for clinical research, and promote the transformation from clinical research type to scientific research management type.
32306118, An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.
32306118, Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed.
32306118, Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
32306118, Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.
32305937, Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification.
32305937, Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis.
32305937, In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.
32305937, We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.

32305506, We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak.
32305506, We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.
32305506, This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32304509, Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread.
32304509, Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19.
32304509, Multi-directional investigations are crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.
32304435, Severe complications have been reported to occur in 33% of patients with COVID-19 and include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, acute respiratory injury, septic shock, and severe pneumonia.
32304435, Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19 and many clinical trials are currently investigating potential medications to treat COVID-19.
32304435, The immunosuppressed status of some cancer patients (whether caused by the disease itself or the treatment) increases their risk of infection compared with the general population.
32304435, This short review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on a cancer patient and discuss management options and recommendation in addition to highlighting the currently available clinical guidelines and resources.

32304402, B, 92%), specificity(100%, 87%) and accuracy(92%, 90%).
32304402, Critical cases had higher total severity score(>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(>-779HU) and full width at half maximum(>128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(≦50%) than ordinary/severe cases.
32304402, In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died.A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.
32304401, During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions.
32304401, Physical distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from the novel coronavirus spread.
32304401, This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time.
32304401, Orthopaedic surgeons should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when appropriate, have teams created using physical distancing, understand the department's policy on elective surgery, and engage in routines which enhance physician wellness.

32302706, Since SARS-CoV-2 must bind with ACE2 before entering the host cells in humans, the distribution and expression of ACE2 may be critical for the target organ of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32302706, Moreover, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the implication of ACE2 in the pathological progression in tissue injury and several chronic diseases, ACE2 may also be essential in the progression and clinical outcomes of COVID-19.
32302706, Therefore, we summarized the expression and activity of ACE2 in various physiological and pathological conditions, and discussed its potential implication in the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in the current review.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32302462, While we agree that this interim guidance addresses important considerations for monitoring the disease process, we believe that the proposed treatment strategy of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to treat severe COVID-19 coagulopathy is an unconvincing strategy.
32302462, Patients that are critically ill with COVID-19 have hallmark signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)(2), and as noted in the ISTH interim guidance and our own clinical practice, thrombosis is the overwhelming phenotype with rare bleeding complications.
32302462, We address this concern with the existing data on the severe hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 victims and advocate for consideration of systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin to prevent life threatening micro- and macrovascular thrombosis to mitigate their associated consequences, up to and including progression of respiratory and organ failure.This article is protected by copyright.

32302448, Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases.At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 μg/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933).
32302448, Fibrinogen levels were associated (R2  = .506, P = .003) with interleukin-6 values.
32302448, After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P = .001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P = .017), CS (P = .013), PCS (P = .035), and FCS (P = .038).The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease.
32302448, Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.© 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
32302438, Antithrombin (n=11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n=11) was increased.The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state.
32302438, These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment.
32302438, Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage and optimal duration of prophylaxis.This article is protected by copyright.

32302401, In this Perspective, autopsy results and literature are presented supporting the hypothesis that a little known yet powerful function of neutrophils-the ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-may contribute to organ damage and mortality in COVID-19.
32302401, We show lung infiltration of neutrophils in an autopsy specimen from a patient who succumbed to COVID-19.
32302401, We discuss prior reports linking aberrant NET formation to pulmonary diseases, thrombosis, mucous secretions in the airways, and cytokine production.
32302401, If our hypothesis is correct, targeting NETs directly and/or indirectly with existing drugs may reduce the clinical severity of COVID-19.© 2020 Barnes et al.
32302280,As of March 30th, 2020 there were 161,807 total cases and 2,953 total deaths of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with the number of cases expected to rise.
32302280, Other than supportive care, there are no SARS-CoV-2 specific treatments available for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) or those admitted to the hospital.
32302280, In addition, there are no vaccines available to protect our at-risk healthcare workers.
32302280, The National Institutes of Health is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate for a potential vaccine and the recipients have started to receive the investigational vaccine.2 We present a brief overview of the potential prophylactic and treatment agents under investigation, some which could be initiated in the ED if proven effective.
32302257, The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed.
32302257, Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.
32302257, COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.
32302257, Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.
32302069, Serological assays are urgently needed to conduct serosurveys, to understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection.

32301766, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, infects host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32301766, Pre-clinical models suggest that ACE2 upregulation confers protective effects in acute lung injury.
32301766, Additionally, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors reduce adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease outcomes, but may increase ACE2 levels.
32301766, We review current knowledge of the role of ACE2 in cardiovascular physiology and SARS-CoV-2 virology as well as clinical data to inform the management of patients with or at risk for COVID-19 who require renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy.
32301764, The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care appointed a task force to provide timely, consensus-based expert guidance for neuroanesthesiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32301764, The aim of this document is to provide a focused overview of COVID-19 disease relevant to neuroanesthesia practice.
32301764, This consensus statement provides information on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, advice for neuroanesthesia clinical practice during emergent neurosurgery, interventional radiology (excluding endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke), transnasal neurosurgery, awake craniotomy and electroconvulsive therapy, as well as information about healthcare provider wellness.
32301764, Institutions and healthcare providers are encouraged to adapt these recommendations to best suit local needs, considering existing practice standards and resource availability to ensure safety of patients and providers.
32301761, Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom.
32301761, Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P < 0.001).
32301761, Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms.We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms.
32301761, These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.
32301749, Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate the validity of the MAGLUMI 2000 Plus CLIA assay for the measurement of specific IgM and IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients, and for obtaining valuable data on the kinetics of both (IgM and IgG) COVID-19 antibodies.
32301749, These data represent a pre-requisite for the appropriate utilization of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
32301647, Conclusion In patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, visual or software quantification the extent of CT lung abnormality were predictors of ICU admission or death.
32301508, According to the adherence scores, adherence to AMSTAR-2 items sequentially decreased in SRs on SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
32301508, The methodological quality of most SRs on coronavirus outbreaks is unsatisfactory, and those on COVID-19 have higher risks of poor quality, despite the rapid actions taken to conduct SRs.
32301508, The quality of SRs should be improved in the future.
32301508, Readers must exercise caution in accepting and using the results of these SRs.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32301478, If a confirmed case requires laboratory testing, what is the population who are laboratory-tested? Due to limited laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of an emerging epidemic, only "suspected cases" are laboratory-tested in most countries.
32301478, This will result in underdiagnosis of confirmed cases and also raises the question: how is a "suspect case" defined? With the passage of time and increased capability to perform laboratory tests, more people can be screened and the number of confirmed cases will increase.
32301478, What are the technical considerations of laboratory testing? This includes specimen collection (variable collection methods), samples collected (upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory test methods and kits (not all of which may be standardised or approved by authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration).
32301478, Are approved laboratory facilities and trained manpower available, and how are test results interpreted and false-negatives excluded? These issues will affect the accuracy of disease counts, which in turn will have implications on how we mount an appropriate response to the outbreak.
32301390, Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection.
32301390, We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function.
32301390, It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases.
32301390, The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.
32301206,As senior medical students in the UK, we read Dr Stein's letter on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)2 and began wondering where we fit in, in this pandemic.
32301206, As the government heads into a 'war footing',13 there is an increased need for medical staff.
32301206, There is speculation of bringing back retired doctors, many of who fall into at-risk categories.

32301099, There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults.
32301099, There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases.
32301099, The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03).
32301099, Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
32300971, Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417).
32300971, Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000).
32300971, The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits.Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.
32300971, A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19.• Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. • A diagnostic model for COVID-19 was developed and validated using radiological semantic and clinical features, which had an area under the curve value of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) and 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.

32298273, Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney.
32298273, And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3.
32298273, In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs.
32298273, And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.
32298251, These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions.
32298251, These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain)† to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public.
32298251, In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5).
32298251, Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.
32298146, Challenges were encountered and overcome through interdisciplinary collaboration and iterative surge planning as ICU admissions rose.
32298146, Support was provided for both clinical and nonclinical staff affected by the profound impact COVID-19 had on our city.
32298146, We describe in granular detail the procedures and processes that were developed during a 1-month period while surge planning was ongoing and the need for ICU capacity rose exponentially.
32298146, The approaches described here provide a potential roadmap for centers that must rapidly adapt to the tremendous challenge posed by this and potential future pandemics.
32298036, In the present commentary, we provide a framework for prioritizing head and neck surgery during the pandemic.
32298036, Unique considerations for the head and neck patient are examined including risk to the oncology patient, outcomes following delay in head and neck cancer therapy, and risk of transmission during otolaryngologic surgery.
32298036, Our case prioritization criteria consist of four categories: urgent-proceed with surgery, less urgent-consider postpone > 30 days, less urgent-consider postpone 30 to 90 days, and case-by-case basis.

32297796, Management of ACovCS should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists and cardiologists.
32297796, Priorities for managing ACovCS include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point where intervention may be most effective.
32297796, The aim of this paper is to review the best available data on ACovCS epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.
32297796, From these data, we propose a surveillance, diagnostic and management strategy that balances potential patient risks and healthcare staff exposure with improvement in meaningful clinical outcomes.
32297727, The BCRSS was rapidly developed in Brescia, Italy, during that nation's COVID-19 crisis.
32297727, The scale has not been validated or tested in other populations.
32297727, The BCRSS uses patient examination features along with the need for escalating levels of respiratory support (NIV, intubation, proning) to suggest treatment recommendations.
32297727, The scale simplifies the clinical summary of a patient's status, and allows clinicians to compare patients to one another and to track the trend of a patient's level of respiratory severity over time.
32297540, Cox regression analyses revealed that platelet count was an independent risk factor associated with in-hospital mortality in a dose-dependent manner.
32297540, An increment of per 50 × 109/L in platelets was associated with a 40% decrease in mortality (hazard ratio: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.84).
32297540, Dynamic changes of platelets were also closely related to death during hospitalization.Baseline platelet levels and changes were associated with subsequent mortality.
32297540, Monitoring platelets during hospitalization may be important in the prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease in 2019.
32296940, Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial.
32296940, Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
32296940, Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency.
32296940, Key Points • In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. • Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. • Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.
32296888, Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment.
32296888, Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2-positive patients.
32296888, Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2 patients should be considered.
32296888, Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.
32296824, Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.© The Author(s) 2020.

32296808, Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses.
32296808, Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging.
32296808, We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation.The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow.
32296808, This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.
32295662, Sixteen plans had clear indicators, triggers, and lines of responsibility.
32295662, Finally, 28 had evidence-based clinical processes and operations.
32295662, Five plans contained all 5 IOM elements: Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, and Vermont.
32295662, Colorado and Minnesota have all hazards documents and processes for both adult and pediatric populations and could be considered exemplars for other states.
32295661, Using data from Italy and other countries we evaluated the role of different determinants of this phenomenon.
32295661, We found that the Italian testing strategy could explain an important part of the observed difference in CFR.
32295661, In particular, the majority of patients that are currently tested in Italy have severe clinical symptoms that usually require hospitalization and this translates to a large CFR.
32295661, We are confident that, once modifications in the testing strategy leading to higher population coverage are consistently adopted in Italy, CFR will realign with the values reported worldwide.
32295460, Since then, oculoplastic surgeons in Hong Kong have been taking every measure to protect all healthcare workers and patients from contracting the disease.
32295460, This paper aims to share the experiences of and measures taken by local oculoplastic surgeons in combating COVID-19.
32295460, Three main aspects are discussed, namely clinical, administrative, and training and educational.
32295460, We hope our experiences would provide reference to fellow oculoplastic colleagues in other parts of the world in fighting this COVID-19 pandemic.
32295324, Conclusions: There wasn't any novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis in 81 patients with coronavirus disease-19.(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:).
32295322, Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases.
32295322, The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.
32295188, We performed a narrative review to describe existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective.
32295188, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles.
32295188, Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current state of the art.
32295188, In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and preparedness.
32295153, Stably-transformed plants are another option, but this approach requires more time for the development of antigen-producing lines.
32295153, Nonetheless, this approach offers the possibility of developing oral vaccines in which the plant cell could act as the antigen delivery agent.
32295153, Therefore, this is the most attractive approach in terms of cost, easy delivery, and mucosal immunity induction.
32295153, The development of multiepitope, rationally-designed vaccines is also discussed regarding the experience gained in expression of chimeric immunogenic proteins in plant systems.
32294858, Conclusion: Most of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection have pulmonary inflammation.CT manifestations include multiple parts, subpleural area or middle and lateral field of lung, ground glass shadow and consolidation, or coexistence.
32294858, Some cases have pleural thickening or interlobular septal thickening.
32294858, CT images can indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide important basis for early detection and disease monitoring.
32294817, But the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease are not clear yet.
32294817, Virological researches revealed close relationship between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.
32294817, The experience and knowledge we gained from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially with regard to the time course of viral replication, host immune response and clinical progression of the patient, may provide important insights into understanding and management of COVID-19.
32294817, Clinical deterioration accompanied by decreasing viral load in the second week after symptom onset was noted both in SARS and COVID-19, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to excessive host immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication.
32294816,The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs.
32294816, One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV.
32294816, Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients.
32294816, The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
32473418, Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19.
32473418, Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient.Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Société française de rhumatologie.

32472897, In addition, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) are even more exposed, due to increased contact with the population in hospitals and emergency services.
32472897, OMFS should be able to identify a suspected case of COVID-19, its symptoms, risk groups, disease severity, laboratorial and computed tomography alterations, and treatment guidelines.
32472897, In the present study, the authors performed a nationwide survey with Brazilian OMFS to evaluate the knowledge of these professionals about the pandemic status of the COVID-19.
32472897, A total of 142 OMFS replied the survey and the results brings light to an incomparable health public problem that the OMFS in Brazil are no able to protect itself, diagnose the suspicious and probable cases, request and interpret the correct laboratorial examinations for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients.

32472464, Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients.
32472464, The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind.
32472464, Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged.The use of taxis in emergency inguinal hernia is a useful first line of treatment in areas or situations where surgical care is not immediately available, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

32471302, While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown.
32471302, Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies.
32471302, We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals.
32471302, We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.
32471001, Although a higher respiratory rate was observed at admission in nonsurvivors, symptoms at presentation were similar between both groups.
32471001, Patients who died were more anemic, lymphopenic and showed higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 at their first tests.

32470824, In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium.Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom.
32470824, Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria.
32470824, Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32469614, Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine.
32469614, The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2-7).
32469614, All patients recovered.
32469614, More research is needed to understand the risks of COVID-19 among PLWH and the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19.
32469189, Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation.Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020).
32469189, Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact.
32469189, In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations.Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32469189, They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the visitation scheme which may otherwise have put an overwhelming burden on the ACIM.
32468193, However, it is assumed that these patients are at high risk, because of respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function.
32468193, These findings may exacerbate swallowing deficits.
32468193, The aim of this review is to summarize available information on possible mechanisms of postintubation dysphagia in COVID-19 patients.
32468193, Recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of postintubation dysphagia in COVID-19 patients are described in this contemporary review.
32467809, Performing appendectomy in acute appendicitis patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is challenging, as it involves considerable operative risks for the patients and risks for health care professionals (HCPs) exposed to COVID-19.
32467809, Medical management eliminates the morbidity and mortality associated with surgery but involves significant risks of treatment failures that, in turn, may lead to perforation, peritonitis, and death. We are reporting a case of a middle-aged man with multiple co-morbidities, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and acute appendicitis.
32467809, Our patient received intravenous antibiotics for seven days with a significant improvement in symptoms.

32467554, The Malaysia Stroke Council is concerned regarding the level of care given to stroke patients during this pandemic.
32467554, During the recent National Stroke Workflow Steering Committee meeting, a guide was made based on the currently available evidences to assist Malaysian physicians providing acute stroke care in the hospital setting in order to provide the best stroke care while maintaining their own safety.
32467554, The guide comprises of prehospital stroke awareness, hyperacute stroke care, stroke care unit and intensive care unit admission, post-stroke rehabilitation and secondary prevention practice.
32467554, We urge continuous initiative to provide the best stroke care possible and ensure adequate safety for both patients and the stroke care team.
32467457, Also, fever was observed.
32467457, Laboratory testing revealed lymphopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin with D-dimer, ferritin and interleukin-6 usually elevated.
32467457, Respiratory support and inotropic support were almost always necessary.
32467457, In all of them, deterioration occurred on the day of admission.
32466738, The mean number of stroke codes dispatched to hospitals decreased (78% versus 57%, P<0.001).
32466738, Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed >30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways.
32466738, Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges.
32466738, It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.
32466164, Among the 65 physical therapists who completed our survey, 21 (32.3%) and 12 (18.5%) physical therapists reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively.
32466164, If a physical therapist was living with a ≤6-year-old infant or child, the possibility of the presence of anxiety was significantly higher.
32466164, The risk of depression among those who were in their 30 s and 50 s was significantly higher than among those in their 20 s.
32466164, Thus, physical therapists living with a ≤6-year-old infant or child and those in their 30 s and 50 s need special attention.
32464707, This is in contrast to the venous thrombosis and microangiopathy that has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19.
32464707, Our cases suggest that even in the absence of severe disease, patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of thrombus formation leading to stroke, perhaps due to viral involvement of the endothelium.
32464707, Further systematic study is needed, since this may have implications for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with COVID-19.This article is protected by copyright.

32463802, Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). 80% of programs reported quarantining a resident. 90/91 programs reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts.ConclusionMany resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment.
32463802, Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs.

32463367, Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries.
32463367, A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements.
32463367, The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19.
32463367, Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the Internet.

32462708, Past work has found that intubated patients with ARDS experience physiological benefits to the prone position, as it promotes better matching of pulmonary perfusion to ventilation, improved secretion clearance, and recruitment of dependent areas of the lungs.
32462708, We created a system-wide multi-institutional (New York-Presbyterian Hospital enterprise) protocol for placing awake, non-intubated, Emergency Department patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the prone position.
32462708, In this piece, we describe the background literature and the approach we have taken at our institution as we care for a high burden of COVID-19 cases with respiratory symptoms.This article is protected by copyright.

32462305, Meta-analyses were performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same outcome.
32462305, Special considerations in urological conditions that were relevant in the pandemic of COVID-19 were reported in a narrative manner.There were a total of 21 studies with 3714 COVID-19 patients, and urinary symptoms were absent in all of them.
32462305, In patients with COVID-19, 7.58% (95% CI 3.30-13.54%) developed acute kidney injury with a mortality rate of 93.27% (95% CI 81.46-100%) amongst them. 5.74% (95% CI 2.88-9.44%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in urine samples, but the duration of viral shedding in urine was unknown. 65.82% (95% CI 45.71-83.51%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in stool samples, which were detected from 2 to 47 days from symptom onset. 31.6% of renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 required non-invasive ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%.Acute kidney injury leading to mortality is common amongst COVID-19 patients, likely as a result of direct viral toxicity.
32462305, Viral RNA positivity was detected in both urine and stool samples, so precautions are needed when we perform transurethral or transrectal procedures.
32462267, Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes.
32462267, As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified.
32462267, As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn.
32462267, As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention.
32460839, The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment.
32460839, After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment.
32460839, Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition.
32460839, This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.
32460566, Less than half of the students reported a high health literacy level (43%, n = 365/855).
32460566, When asked where students have heard about COVID-19, the majority reported the Internet and social media.
32460566, Students reported a basic level of COVID-19 knowledge, but few students (18%, n = 173/966) correctly identified all three signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19.
32460566, Results highlight the need for an increased public health presence on social media and the urgent need to remain diligent in educating community members about COVID-19 myths.
32460457, Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened.A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5).
32460457, Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation.
32460457, During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization.The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis.
32460457, LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.
32460229, The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, Rc, produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers R0.The controlled reproduction number in China is much lower than one in all regions of China by now.
32460229, It fell below one within 30 days from the implementations of unprecedent containment measures, which indicates that the strong measures taken by China government was effective to contain the epidemic.
32460229, Nonetheless, efforts are still needed in order to end the current epidemic as imported cases from overseas pose a high risk of a second outbreak.Copyright © 2020.

32459664, Even assuming that only half are, at least 7% of Italians and 10% in Lombardy had been affected by Covid-19.
32459664, To these, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases have to be added.
32459664, These estimates are at least one or two orders of magnitude larger than official registered cases.
32459664, This has major implications for cancer prevention, management and treatment.
32459186, Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23.
32459186, Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
32459186, Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation.Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety.These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders.
32459186, Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.
32458550, Results showed that moderate to high levels of anxiety associated with COVID-19 were significantly associated with general somatic symptoms and in particular with gastrointestinal and fatigue symptoms.
32458550, This pattern of associations remained significant after controlling for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), pre-existing health problems, age, gender, and income.
32458550, This is the first evidence that anxiety associated with COVID-19 makes a unique contribution to somatization, above and beyond the effect of GAD.© 2020 The Authors.

32458197, Symptoms vary from non-specific such as headache or dizziness to more specific such as convulsions and cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
32458197, This study aims to give an overview of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss the potential pathogenetic mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
32458197, Clinicians and especially internists, neurologists, and infectious disease specialists should be aware of these symptoms and able to recognize them early.
32458197, Prompt diagnosis and immediate management of the neurological manifestations of the novel coronavirus will not only improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients but will also prevent the dissemination of the disease due to misdiagnosed cases.
32458193, Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in a cerebrospinal fluid specimen of a patient with COVID-19 have provided direct evidence to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2.
32458193, However, the underlying neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are yet to be established.
32458193, SARS-CoV-2 may affect CNS through two direct mechanisms (hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde dissemination) or via indirect routes.
32458193, The underlying mechanisms require further elucidation in the future.
32458019, A comparison was performed between the clinicopathological features of the patients in each group as was the changing incidence of AA.A total of 378 patients were identified, 237 in Group A and 141 in Group B (62.7% vs. 37.3%).
32458019, Following the onset of COVID-19, the weekly incidence of AA decreased by 40.7% (p = 0.02).
32458019, There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the length of preoperative symptoms or surgery, need for postoperative peritoneal drainage or the distribution of complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis.The significant decrease in the number of patients admitted with AA during the onset of COVID-19 possibly represents successful resolution of mild appendicitis treated symptomatically by patients at home.
32458019, Further research is needed to corroborate this assumption and identify those patients who may benefit from this treatment pathway.
32456959, Research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through close contact via respiratory droplets, but there is the possibility for ocular transmission, with the conjunctiva as a conduit as well as a source of infection.Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis, and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19-positive patients.
32456959, Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears, based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
32456959, The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites.All health care professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, and use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks by both the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32456689, We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations.Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases.Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease.
32456689, However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally.
32456689, The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation.
32456689, Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them.
32455475, Patients with preexisting cardio-vascular conditions are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms and worse outcome.
32455475, Data also suggest that cancer patients are particularly vulnerable, but differences between tumor entities and cancer treatments may exist.

32455089, Initial retrospective studies emerging from China and France, as well as case reports from different parts of the world revealed a spectrum of neurological symptoms ranging from a simple headache to more serious encephalitis and dysexecutive syndromes.
32455089, Authors have tried to explain this neurotropism of the virus by comparing invasion mechanisms with prior epidemic coronavirus like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Concrete evidence on those viruses has been limited.
32455089, This review attempts to discuss various pathophysiological mechanisms as it relates to neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2.
32455089, We will also discuss the neurological manifestations seen in various retrospective studies, systemic reviews, and case reports.Copyright © 2020, Sheraton et al.
32454808, Biological samples collected immediately after birth from upper respiratory tract (throat or nasopharyngeal) of neonates and placental tissues showed negative results for the presence SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test.
32454808, No breast milk samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and, to date, there is no evidence on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk of pregnant women with COVID-19.
32454808, However, data are still limited and breastfeeding of women with COVID-19 remains a controversial issue.
32454808, There are no restrictions on the use of milk from a human breast milk bank.
32452979, Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia and hypotension resolved.
32452979, Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-α, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations.
32452979, This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade.
32452979, The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with MIS-C temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation.
32452978, Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects models.Four studies reporting data from 36 children were included.
32452978, A higher proportion of children had viral shedding in stools after 14 days of symptoms onset compared to respiratory samples (RR= 3.2, 95%CI 1.2 to 8.9, I2 = 51%).
32452978, Viral RNA shedding was longer in fecal samples with a mean difference of approximately 9 days (Mean Difference = 8.6, 95%CI 1.7 to 15.4, I2 = 77%) compared with respiratory samples.SARS-CoV-2 shedding seems to be present in feces for a longer time than in the respiratory tract of children.
32452978, Although fecal SARS-CoV-2 presence in feces do not confirm its transmissibility, the high and fast spread of the COVID-19 disease worldwide indicate other transmission routes are also plausible.
32452954, The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).
32452954, Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list.
32452954, The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately.
32452954, The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.
32452804, For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline.Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses.
32452804, Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19.
32452804, In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.©Cuihua Shen, Anfan Chen, Chen Luo, Jingwen Zhang, Bo Feng, Wang Liao.

32452545, The diffusion of this entity by the mass media may have caused patients who would not normally consult to do so.9 . Other possible explanations include a concomitant parvovirus B19 outbreak10 or trauma-induced lesions.
32452545, Our study suggests that acral skin lesions are not a specific marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32452545, Although larger prospective studies are needed, current evidence indicates that acral skin lesions should not be regarded as a sign of COVID-19 in otherwise asymptomatic patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32451877, Given the established fundamental role of cardiovascular imaging in modern healthcare, and the specific value of cardiopulmonary radiology in COVID-19 patients, departmental organisation and imaging programs need to be restructured during the pandemic in order to provide access to modern cardiovascular services to both infected and non-infected patients while ensuring safety for healthcare professionals.
32451877, The uninterrupted availability of cardiovascular radiology services remains, particularly during the current pandemic outbreak, crucial for the initial evaluation and further follow-up of patients with suspected or known cardiovascular diseases in order to avoid unnecessary complications.
32451877, Suspected or established COVID-19 patients may also have concomitant cardiovascular symptoms and require further imaging investigations.
32451877, This statement by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) provides information on measures for safety of healthcare professionals and recommendations for cardiovascular imaging during the pandemic in both non-infected and COVID-19 patients.
32451597, A lot of COVID-19 infected patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to multiple organ damage.
32451597, These symptoms are associated with a cytokine storm syndrome.
32451597, The aim of this letter is to note the 5 crucial points that vitamin D could have protective and therapeutic effects against COVID-19.
32451597, For that reason, COVID-19 infection-induced multiple organ damage might be prevented by vitamin D.
32451564, All tested patients reported recovery of smell and/or taste within 8 to 23 days.The data imply that a) COVID-19 can lead to hyposmia in a relevant number of patients, the incidence was approximately 30% in this cohort; b) in most cases, the olfactory disturbance was not associated with nasal obstruction, thus indicating a possible neurogenic origin; and c) the olfactory disorder largely resolved within 1-3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.

32451564, These early data may help in the interpretation of COVID-19-associated hyposmia as well as in the counseling of patients, given the temporary nature of hyposmia observed in this study.
32451564, Furthermore, according to the current experience, hyposmia without rhinitic obstruction can be the leading or even the only symptom of a SARS-CoV‑2 infection.

32449099, Furthermore, 97.1% of African Americans were RT-PCR (+) compared to 65.8% of Caucasians.We found a similar spectrum of thoracic imaging findings in COVID-19 patients as previous studies.
32449099, The most common demographic were African Americans (76.8%).
32449099, Furthermore, 97.1% of African Americans were RT-PCR (+) compared to 65.8% of Caucasians.
32449099, Both CT and CXR can accurately identify COVID-19 pneumonitis in 89.6% of RT-PCR (+) cases, 89.5% of false negatives, and 72.7% of cases with no RT-PCR result.
32449034, Furthermore, the expression of ACE-2 receptors in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon suggests that these organs should also be considered as a potential high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32449034, During aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP; e.g. intubating and extubating patients or any surgical procedures), the production of both airborne particles and droplets may increase the risk of infection.
32449034, In this situation, the surgical staff is strongly recommended to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).
32449034, A transparent plastic cube, the so-called "Aerosol Box" (AB), has been recently designed to lend further protection against droplets and aerosol exposure during the AGMP.
32449021,To estimate the prevalence of smell or taste impairment in household contacts of mildly symptomatic home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.Cross-sectional study based on ad hoc questions.Of 214 mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients managed at home under self-isolation, 179 reported to have at least one household contact, with the total number of no study participants contacts being 296.
32449021, Among 175 household contacts not tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 67 (38.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 compatible symptoms, 39 (22.3%) had loss of smell or taste with 7 (4.0%) having loss of smell or taste in the absence of other symptoms.
32449021, The prevalence of smell or taste impairment was 1.5% in patients tested negative compared to 63.0% of those tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001).Smell or taste impairment are quite common in not-tested household contacts of mildly symptomatic home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.
32449021, This should be taken into account when estimating the burden of loss of sense of smell and taste during COVID-19 pandemic, and further highlights the value of loss of sense of smell and taste as a marker of infection.

32447629, NSAID use must also be categorized by whether the drugs are relatively low-dose over-the-counter oral products taken occasionally versus higher-dose or parenteral NSAIDs.
32447629, Even if evidence emerged arguing for or against NSAIDs in this setting, it is unclear if this evidence would apply to all NSAIDs at all doses in all dosing regimens.
32447629, Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been proposed as an alternative to NSAIDs but there are issues with liver toxicity at high doses.
32447629, There are clearly COVID-19 cases where NSAIDs should not be used, but there is no strong evidence that NSAIDs must be avoided in all patients with COVID-19; clinicians must weigh these choices on an individual basis.

32446305, The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever.
32446305, Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19.
32446305, Children with TB are a vulnerable group especially likely to suffer as part of the "collateral damage". There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TB-HIV, and this will require unpicking.
32446305, Lessons for COVID-19 could be learned from the vast experience of running global TB control programmes, while the astonishingly rapid and relatively well co-ordinated response to COVID-19 demonstrates how existing programmes could be significantly improved.

32445710, When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts.
32445710, Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number <1).Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts.

32445134, Conjunctivitis is not a common manifestation of the disease, but contact with infected eyes could be one route of transmission.
32445134, Consequently, ophthalmologists need to have correct prevention strategies in place.
32445134, Some guidelines regarding the prevention and management of ophthalmology clinics are reviewed.
32445134, However, well-designed trials should be conducted to rule out other ocular manifestations that may result from COVID-19 infection and to understand the transmission of the virus through the eyes.
32444412, Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features.
32444412, Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system.In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86).
32444412, Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014).
32444412, Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.Copyright ©ERS 2020.

32441548, Conclusions A significant decrease in all SECDs admissions has been observed during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and was unlikely caused by a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases.
32441548, Fear of contagion may have contributed to the unpredictable drop of SECDs.

32438687, The COVID-19 pandemic mirrors with the diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects.
32438687, Our interest is to emphasize the ties between the immunoinflammatory mechanisms that underlie the morbidity and lethality when COVID-19 meets diabetes.
32438687, This review brings attention to two pathologies of highly complex, multifactorial, developmental and environmentally dependent manifestations of critical importance to human survival.
32438687, Extreme caution should be taken with diabetics with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
32438677, IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms.
32438677, Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone.
32438677, All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic.
32438677, LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.
32438622,The novel Coronavirus 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has surprised health authorities around the world, quickly producing a global health crisis.
32438622, Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
32438622, In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat.
32438622, In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications.

32436581,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic is causing an increased need for mechanical ventilation for a significant percentage of people who present to the hospital for treatment.
32436581, This increase in demand could surpass the supply of ventilators and lead to an increase in mortality due to a lack of ventilator vacancies.
32436581, There is significant evidence that osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) can alleviate pulmonary symptoms and aid in quicker recoveries from various respiratory ailments.
32436581, OMM has the potential to play a significant role in helping reduce a patient's need for mechanical ventilation by delaying the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome stemming from SARS-Cov2 infections.
32436441,Based on observations described in our letter, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) anosmia must imperatively be added to the list of specific symptoms of COVID-19 infection, (2) anosmia can serve as a free and specific diagnostic tool for developing countries currently affected by the pandemic, (3) the mechanisms of COVID-19 anosmia seem not to directly involve nasal obstruction but rather seem to be related to damage the olfactory neuroepithelium.
32435065, Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and adequate management of organ failure are the mainstays of therapy.
32435065, In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres.
32435065, New, experimental therapies are evolving with ever increasing frequency; currently, however, no evidence-based recommendation is possible.
32435065, If off-label and compassionate use of these drugs is considered, an individual benefit-risk assessment is necessary, since serious side effects have been reported.
32434605, Contamination fear is a common obsessional theme in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and there is a need for increased research on how infectious disease epidemics affect patients with OCD.
32434605, We present the case of a lady in her thirties with a history of well controlled contamination OCD who presented acutely with a significant exacerbation of OCD symptoms precipitated by media reports of COVID-19.
32434605, The case highlights the potential psychological impacts of infectious disease epidemics on individuals with mental illness.
32434605, We also highlight some of the risks posed to such patients in response to epidemics such as the COVID-19 crisis.
32434337, Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found.
32434337, Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes.
32434337, The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities.
32434337, Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.
32434289, The patient was transported to operating theatre with supplemental oxygen over a face mask and plastic covering over the trolley.
32434289, Rapid sequence intubation was performed by an experienced anesthetist using a videolaryngoscope.
32434289, After surgery, the patient remained intubated to avoid re-intubation due to initial presentation of respiratory distress.
32434289, Droplet, contact and airborne infection precautions were instituted.Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimising risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.
32434108, In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining life-saving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32434108, The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screened for COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32434093, Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores.
32434093, Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia.

32434058, The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management.
32434058, We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.
32434058, We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

32433226, Furthermore, pathological features have not been clear.
32433226, Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited.
32433226, However, diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases, particularly in newborns and infants.
32433226, It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.
32433162, The patient was instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days, and no COVID-19 test was performed.
32433162, Upon arrival, the patient had low-grade fever of 37.1°C, but did not meet infection control criteria for COVID-19 testing, and it was approved to proceed with PET/CT.
32433162, The FDG PET/CT images revealed new multifocal hypermetabolic bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities that are suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32433162, Meanwhile, the patient's symptoms worsened, and a blood test later confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32431992, However, when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning are unsuccessful, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) may be used.  We present a case of a 41-year-old female, with no significant medical history and no recent history of exposure to sick contacts, presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, severe shortness of breath, and flu-like symptoms with a positive COVID-19 test.
32431992, Ultimately, she worsened on mechanical ventilation and prone positioning and required VV-ECMO.
32431992, The use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 infected patients is still controversial.
32431992, While some studies have shown a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment, such as in our case, the lack of large sample size studies and treatment alternatives places healthcare providers against a wall without options in patients with severe refractory ARDS due to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Douedi et al.
32431120, The literature existing so-far is scarce.
32431120, It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams.
32431120, Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one's medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma.
32431120, A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.
32431118, As of mid-April over 2 million people have been infected with over 145 thousand casualties.
32431118, The disease is more severe in the older population, whereas in children lower infection rates and milder symptoms are more common.
32431118, Severe symptoms in the pediatric population, although uncommon, have been reported mainly in infants younger than 1 year of age.
32431118, Perinatal transmission is infrequent and associated with a relatively mild illness in the newborn.
32430964, Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks.
32430964, However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.Children are unlikely to be the main drivers of the pandemic.

32428964, Chi-square and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [n = 60] or exposure only [n = 21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic).
32428964, In total, there were 46 symptomatic women and 22 asymptomatic women (tested based on exposure only [n = 12] or as part of universal screening [n = 10]) with confirmed COVID-19.
32428964, Of symptomatic women (n = 46), 27.3% had preterm delivery and 26.1% needed respiratory support while none of the asymptomatic women (n = 22) had preterm delivery or need of respiratory support (p = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women.
32428964, It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms.· Respiratory support is often needed for women who present with symptoms.. · Low rate of severe disease in women who present without symptoms.. · There were no neonatal infections on day 0 of life..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

32428113, In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to 10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not considered as a risk group.
32428113, Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19.
32428113, Toward this, we raise two main </mac_aq>points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in users of chronic angiotensin 1 </mac_aq>receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating coronaviruses.
32428113, We believe that these points are pivotal for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and must be carefully addressed by physicians and scientists in the field.
32428112,This article presents expert recommendations for assisting newborn children of mothers with suspected or diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 </mac_aq>(COVID-19).
32428112, The consensus was developed by five experts with an average of 20 years of experience in neonatal intensive care working at a reference university hospital in Brazil for the care of pregnant women and newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
32428112, Despite the lack of scientific evidence regarding the potential for viral transmission to their fetus in pregnant mothers diagnosed with or suspected of COVID-19, it is important to elaborate the lines of care by specialists from hospitals caring for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to guide multidisciplinary teams and families diagnosed with the disease or involved in the care of pregnant women and newborns in this context.
32428112, Multidisciplinary teams must be attentive to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 so that decision-making is oriented and assertive for the management of the mother and newborn in both the hospital setting and at hospital discharge.
32427569, HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members.
32427569, Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., "already protected", the ones in the acute phase, i.e., "the infectious", and the virus-naive, i.e., "at risk" workers.
32427569, Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

32427334, Analysis of daily samples from six patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike antibodies appearing between day 8 and day 14 after initial symptoms.
32427334, Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to immunocompetent patients.Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection.

32427134, Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS).
32427134, Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients.
32427134, It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32427134, Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

32425996, However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others.
32425996, There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic.

32425470, The virus is easily transmitted by droplets (e.g., sneezing, coughing) and communal living settings such as personal care homes can be vulnerable to the spread of the virus.
32425470, Identifying patients early in the disease process is important to providing appropriate medical interventions.
32425470, To date, most of the medical literature, including Center for Disease Control guidelines, has relied on three necessary symptoms in making the diagnosis of COVID-19: fever, cough and shortness of breath.

32425014, In patients with COVID-19, the full cardiovascular disease diagnostic algorithm can be hindered by logistic restrain mainly derived from the difficulty of transporting patients in critical conditions to Radiology or Hemodynamics wards.
32425014, The echocardiography in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can help for differential diagnosis of cardiac events, which can be related or unrelated by the infection and can likely impact on short-term prognosis.
32425014, Indeed, transthoracic echocardiography plays a key role in the screen for CV complications of COVID-19 infection: it must be focused cardiac ultrasound study (FoCUS) performed at bedside.
32425014, All transthoracic, transesophageal and stress echocardiograms in patients in which test results are unlikely to change the management strategy should be postponed.
32424329, Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32424329, The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis.
32424329, All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results.Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.
32424329, Therefore, possibility of ocular transmission should be considered even in the absence of ocular manifestations.
32423917, Although over 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic or manifest noncritical symptoms and will recover from the infection, those individuals presenting with critical symptoms are in urgent need of effective treatment options.
32423917, Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics.
32423917, A critical literature review suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses, which in turn inhibits the development of protective immunity to the infection.
32423917, Therefore, the use of therapeutics that modulate inflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response could be the most effective therapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.
32423359, Of the 220 respondents, 93 (42%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 127 (58%) were not.
32423359, A total of 37.7% of respondents reported changes in smell/taste as the initial or sole presentation of their condition.
32423359, Most but not all patients had other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 at the time of chemosensory loss.
32423359, Despite its inclusion as a major symptom of COVID-19 by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), respondents with additional CDC-defined symptoms associated with COVID-19 were statistically more likely to be tested/diagnosed than those without.
32423357, SOB was more severe in patients with OD.
32423357, OD was associated negatively with older age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = .007) and positively with female sex (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-6.19; P = .056).OD is highly prevalent during COVID-19, occurring early and severely, often in conjunction with loss of taste.
32423357, OD is associated negatively with older age and positively with female sex.
32423357, Patients with OD may also experience more severe SOB.
32423285, Aggregate analysis demonstrated an incidence of 49.6% (n = 497 of 1002; 95% CI, 46.5%-52.7%), 47.9% (n = 480 of 1002; 95% CI, 44.8%-51.0%), and 17.9% (n = 880 of 4909; 95% CI, 16.9%-19.0%) for smell loss, taste loss, and smell or taste loss, respectively, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32423285, Additionally, there were significantly higher incidences of runny nose/rhinorrhea/rhinitis and nasal congestion/obstruction/blockage in other coronaviruses as compared with SARS-CoV-2 (P < .001).
32423285, Understanding these less well-characterized symptoms may help develop measures for estimating early markers of disease prevalence and/or resolution.

32422545, Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed.
32422545, Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen.

32422280, A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept.
32422280, Indeed, obesity, air pollution and smoking associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiologies that are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-System in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

32422233, Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34 kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality.
32422233, The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34 kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45-9.83; p = 0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25-5.98; p = 0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13-2.63; p = 0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality.
32422233, Similarly, age, male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation.In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32422201, Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0-99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2-32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6-8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.
32422201, Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred.
32422201, These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.All authors are employed and all expenses covered by governmental, federal state, or other publicly funded institutions.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32422178, Furthermore, several licensed and potential antifibrotic compounds have been assessed in models of acute lung injury and viral pneumonia.
32422178, Data from previous coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32422178, Antifibrotic therapies that are available or in development could have value in preventing severe COVID-19 in patients with IPF, have the potential to treat severe COVID-19 in patients without IPF, and might have a role in preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32421686, Tweets were mainly focused on actions and recommendations (28%) needed to control the pandemic.
32421686, Many tweets warned about misleading information (20%) which could lead to more cases infected with the virus.
32421686, Other tweets discussed general Knowledge and information (9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the healthcare systems and workers (9%).
32421686, The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (8%), immunity (7%), testing (6%), and virus infection and transmission (5%).Findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms could help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during the pandemic outbreak.
32420954, So, they have been defined as "sentinel" symptoms.
32420954, We presented a series of COVID-19 patients.
32420954, Anos- mia and dysgeusia frequently preceded respiratory complaints.
32420954, Anosmia and dysgeusia seem to be short-lived and self-resolving in COVID-19, thus a neurotoxic effect swiftly disappearing and/or cytopathic damage could be hypothesized similarly to other viral infections.
32420937, Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed.
32420937, First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels.
32420937, The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.
32420937, Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far.
32420937, As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.
32420937, Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis.
32420937, The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.
32420931, The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used.One hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey.
32420931, Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 ≥ 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs. 79.2%, p=.025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs. 19.8%, p=.024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs. 23.8%, p=.049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs. 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.041).
32420931, Moreover, PHQ-9 ≥ 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 ± 4.96 vs. 4.88 ± 3.53 and 11.60 ± 5.53 vs. 4.84 ± 3.81, respectively; p<.001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 ± 7.45 vs. 46.01 ± 7.83, p<.001) and physical (43.50 ± 9.37 vs. 52.94 ± 4.78, p<.001) component summary.Our results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions.
32420931, A precarious healthcare system both at a national and regional level might have triggered negative mental health outcomes in Italian GPs.
32420863, It is known that transmission from person to person is the most important way to spread.
32420863, However, due to the widespread host diversity, a detailed examination of the role of animals in this pandemic is essential to effectively fight against the outbreak.
32420863, Although coronavirus infections in pets are known to be predominantly related to the gastrointestinal tract, it has been observed that there are human-to-animal transmissions in this outbreak and some animals have similar symptoms to humans.
32420863, Although animal-to-animal transmission has been shown to be possible, there is no evidence of animal-to-human transmission.
32419854, The new virus strain is named SARS-CoV-2 and has 85% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
32419854, Until now, it has caused more than 100 000 confirmed cases of infection and almost 5000 deaths, having a mortality rate of 4%. All information (symptoms, signs, management, complications) are taken from the other pandemic infections (SARS, MERS).
32419854, Information about viral infection concerning pregnant women are limited and are common to other SARS infections.
32419854, There are very few cases of pregnant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and studies are ongoing.
32419703, The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support.
32419703, Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference.

32419667, Each of these death attributes is a well-documented correlate of bereaved survivors' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger.
32419667, Yet the grief experienced by survivors of COVID-related deaths is compounded by the erosion of coping resources like social support, contemporaneous stressors including social isolation, financial precarity, uncertainty about the future, lack of routine, and the loss of face-to-face mourning rituals that provide a sense of community and uplift.
32419667, National efforts to enhance advance care planning may help dying patients to receive care that is concordant with the preferences of them and their families.
32419667, Virtual funeral services, pairing bereaved elders with a telephone companion, remote counseling, and encouraging "continuing bonds" may help older adults adapt to loss in the time of pandemic.
32419564, Although most people have no or mild symptoms, COVID-19 spreads aggressively and can lead to ARDS rapidly in a proportion of individuals.
32419564, The evidence supports that gas exchange and countering the negative effects of bed rest and immobility are priorities in severely affected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
32419564, However, in recent years, research has focused on poor long-term functional outcomes in patients with ARDS, often associated with ICU-acquired weakness, deconditioning, and myopathies and neuropathies.
32419564, In addition to physical therapists providing respiratory support in the ICU, the literature unequivocally supports the view that early intervention for ICU management of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 needs to focus on reducing contributors to impaired long-term function, with direct attention paid to preventing or managing ICU-acquired weakness, deconditioning, and myopathies and neuropathies, in conjunction with respiratory care.
32419401, Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population.
32419401, The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection.
32419401, The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols.Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients.

32416290, Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients.
32416290, Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients.
32416290, Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.Copyright © 2020.

32416289, These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease.
32416289, The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS.

32416121, A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05).
32416121, Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05).High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO2 in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes.
32416121, Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32415914, Multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis with 1000 bootstrap resamples were conducted.Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% White with mean age 32.44 ± 11.94 years.
32415914, After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms β = .11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02-0.20.
32415914, Mediation analysis showed that perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 mediated 34.4% of this relationship (β = .04; 95%CI = 0.01-0.06).Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 can serve as a pathway through which exposure to COVID-19 news on mainstream media may be associated with depressive symptoms.

32415733, Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSS through sleep quality (coefficient =1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998).
32415733, In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19.

32415548, Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease.
32415548, According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology.
32415548, The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet.
32415548, There have been no reports of SARS-COV-2 transmission by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes.
32414522, Routine chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in both cases and subsequently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive.
32414522, To the best of our knowledge, there was only one literature to date documented SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis as a late complication of COVID-19 patient.
32414522, Our cases showed that elevated CK and rhabdomyolysis can be the sole initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 and total CK should be ordered in every patient on admission.Copyright © 2020.

32413609, The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model.The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5-11.5) in the second half of January, reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5-9.5) in the first half of February 2020.
32413609, We estimate that SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency improved at a daily rate of 5.40% (95%CI: 2.54-8.33) in Hong Kong.The detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 was likely being improved substantially in Hong Kong since the first imported case was detected.

32412510,The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in China, has spread rapidly to affect the entire world in a matter of months.
32412510, Main manifestations of the disease include a febrile syndrome accompanied by respiratory symptoms; however, cases of systemic involvement are increasingly being reported, including cardiac and central nervous system compromise.
32412510, In the series by Ling M. et al., 214 patients with COVID-19 were studied; 78 (36.4 %) had neurologic manifestations, which were classified into four main groups: acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness, peripheral nervous system involvement and muscular manifestations.
32412510, Another report published by Li et al. describes that, out of 221 patients with COVID-19, 13 developed acute cerebrovascular disease with cerebral infarction, venous thrombosis and intracerebral hemorrhage.
32412125, Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility.
32412125, In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms.

32411034, History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.
32411034, The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.
32411034, History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.
32411034, The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.Copyright © 2020 Zhu, Sun, Zhang, Wang, Fan, Yang, Li and Xiao.
32410808, There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09).
32410808, There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01).The observations at our tertiary care corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms.

32409502, Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese.
32409502, Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and cancer, and drug used for treatment.
32409502, Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003).In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19.

32408776, Sharing data can help to countries that to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with the COVID-19.
32408699, The compound with the best normalized docking score to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (E)-β-farnesene.
32408699, The best docking ligands for SARS-CoV Nsp15/NendoU were (E,E)-α-farnesene, (E)-β-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol. (E,E)-Farnesol showed the most exothermic docking to SARS-CoV-2 ADRP.
32408699, Unfortunately, the docking energies of (E,E)-α-farnesene, (E)-β-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol with SARS-CoV-2 targets were relatively weak compared to docking energies with other proteins and are, therefore, unlikely to interact with the virus targets.
32408699, However, essential oil components may act synergistically, essential oils may potentiate other antiviral agents, or they may provide some relief of COVID-19 symptoms.
32408043, In the analyses, age, fever as an onset symptom, and sex were used as explanatory variables, and death as the objective variable.

32407303, Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5).
32407303, These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances.
32407303, It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
32406852, A total of 31 (54%) graduates had attended training on COVID-19, 29 (51%) are member of a rapid response team against COVID-19 and 54 (95%) had previous experience in response to disease outbreaks or health emergencies.

32405028, Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection3,4.
32405028, Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19.
32405028, Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells.
32405028, The robust SARS-CoV-2 replication in human intestinal organoids suggests that the human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.

32401989,Current COVID-19 epidemics was declared on December 31, 2019 at the Wuhan city seafood market, rapidly spreading throughout China, and later reaching several countries (mainly South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran) and, since March 1, reaching Portugal.
32401989, Most of the infected patients present with mild symptoms, not requiring hospitalization.
32401989, Among those admitted to the hospital, 6% to 10% require admission to the intensive care unit.
32401989, These recommendations are aimed to support the organization of intensive care services to respond COVID-19, providing optimized care to the patient and protection for healthcare professionals.
32401844, In addition, the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell; therefore, the use of ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers could cause an increase in these receptors, thus facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell.
32401844, There is, however, no scientific evidence to support the interruption of these drugs.
32401844, Since they are fundamental for certain chronic diseases, the risk and benefit of their withdrawal in this scenario should be carefully weighed.
32401844, Finally, cardiologists and health professionals should be aware of the risks of infection and protect themselves as much as possible, sleeping properly and avoiding long working hours.

32400371, Apart from a week of slightly runny nose when coming from cold to warm air, the only symptom was a sudden onset of persistent anosmia and ageusia.
32400371, Two weeks after normalisation of the mild sino-nasal symptoms, the patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and anosmia was verified with Sniffin' Sticks tests.
32400371, Hypogeusia was verified with taste screening and two validated taste tests.
32400371, Olfactory and gustatory loss may be underestimated symptoms of COVID-19.
32399719, Case analysis indicated that the nervous system can be invaded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that 36.4% of COVID-19 patients had neurological symptoms.
32399719, Importantly, the involvement of the CNS may be associated with poor prognosis and disease worsening.
32399719, Here, we discussed the symptoms and evidence of nervous system involvement (directly and indirectly) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible mechanisms.
32399719, CNS symptoms could be a potential indicator of poor prognosis; therefore, the prevention and treatment of CNS symptoms are also crucial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32399507, We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place.
32399507, Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5).
32399507, Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government.
32399507, While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region..
32399457, He subsequently developed unilateral weakness.
32399457, Computer tomography identified a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).

32397688, The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32397688, To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
32397688, Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
32397688, Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.
32397515, In conclusion, proactive border control measures are effective for preventing community transmission of this disease.
32397262, Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32397262, Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed.
32397262, In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed.
32397262, If we want to identify "immune" people in order to let them to come back to work, serology is the best (and probably the only) approach.
32396670, The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.67).
32396670, The derived testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of two symptoms (fever, loss of taste or smell) was 89% sensitive and 48% specific (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71 - 0.78).
32396670, The hybrid testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of four symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, loss of taste or smell) was 98% sensitive and 8% specific (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.73 - 0.80).An evidence based approach to COVID-19 testing which at least includes fever and loss of taste or smell should be utilized when determining which HCW should be tested.This article is protected by copyright.

32396445, Conclusions and Relevance.
32396445, COVID-19 patients require ENT consultation for many reasons, including tracheotomy.
32396445, Otolaryngologists play an indispensable role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but, due to their work, are at high risk of exposure.
32396445, Appropriate protective strategies can prevent infection of otolaryngologists.
32395550, At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment.
32395550, After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.
32395550, We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32394650, The outcomes included the symptoms changes, e.g. anxiety, emotional disturbance, fatigue, headache and diarrhea, as well as whether quarantine release and the case confirmed or not, etc.
32394650, The results were evaluated before intervention, in 14 days of intervention and 2 weeks after intervention separately.
32394650, In this research, on the base of internet plus technology and with the internet communication platform adopted, through mobile phone WeChat App, it was to implement the subject screen, the random allocation and the instruction of moxibustion intervention as well as the quality control of patient's diary and data collection.
32394650, It is anticipated that the significance and the implementation mode of moxibustion intervention can be assessed preliminarily for the group under quarantine after close contact with COVID-19.
32394344,Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still scarce.
32394344, This case series of 33 PLWH patients with COVID-19 reveals symptoms and outcome in this special population.Retrospective analysis of anonymized data including age, gender, HIV-associated parameters, symptoms, and outcome.Three out of 32 patients with documented outcomes died (9%). 91% of the patients recovered and 76% have been classified as mild cases.
32394344, All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir.This preliminary case series does not support excess morbidity and mortality among symptomatic COVID-19 PLWH and with viral suppression on ART.
32394344, SARS-CoV-2 infections may occur during boosted darunavir-based and/or on tenofovir-containing ART.
32394237, CT pulmonary angiography and chest CT scans revealed acute massive embolism and typical imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively.
32394237, Interestingly, the patient had no symptoms or signs of infection and also had no risk factors for thromboembolism.
32394237, COVID-19 infection appears to induce venous thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism.
32394237, The case is remarkable in terms of showing how insidious and life-threatening COVID-19 infection can be.
32393767, As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described priority levels for testing patients with suspected COVID-19 and information on when to seek medical attention.
32393767, However, there is a paucity of further guidance for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who may not present with typical symptoms of COVID-19 due to altered physiology.
32393767, This may pose challenges with surveillance, risk stratification, and initial management of this vulnerable population.
32393767, In this point-counterpoint discussion, we outline important differences in presentation along with COVID-19 cases co-morbid with SCI.
32393594, Management of COPD with COVID-19 warrants standard-of-care treatment with antimicrobial agents and corticosteroids, though limiting the dose and duration of steroids use may be warranted due to the risk of increased viral shedding.
32393594, Modalities to treat acute respiratory failure can be used with some caveats.

32393446, The state of Kerala in India saw suicide deaths by six affected individuals, prompting the state government to instruct government doctors to prescribe alcohol to addicts.
32393446, The local medical association approached the courts against this.
32393446, These events raise interesting ethical issues discussed here.

32393381, The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
32393381, After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
32393381, Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
32393381, Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
32393346, Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.
32393346, Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.
32393346, Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.
32393346, Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.
32393105,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents unique challenges for surgical management of laryngotracheal stenosis.
32393105, High viral concentrations in the upper aerodigestive tract, the ability of the virus to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers and through aerosols, and the need for open airway access during laryngotracheal surgery create a high-risk situation for airway surgeons, anesthesiologists, and operating room personnel.
32393105, While some surgical cases of laryngotracheal stenosis may be deferred, patients with significant airway obstruction or progressing symptoms often require urgent surgical intervention.
32393105, We present best practices from our institutional experience for surgical management of laryngotracheal stenosis during this pandemic, including preoperative triage, intraoperative airway management, and personal protective measures.
32392431, Telemedicine can level the playing field and enable higher quality, decentralized care that-when needed-brings specialty care to the masses.
32392431, Other technologies have an important role, too.
32392431, For patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1 diabetes), widespread uptake of continuous glucose monitors may be the game-changer we need right now that can facilitate telemedicine to remote places and remove health care disparities.
32392431, Both health professionals and patients will win-and ultimately payers will, too.
32392280, A satisfaction survey was given to 300 patient respondents, 74% of whom would be extremely likely to recommend their doctor.This program provided a safe and satisfying experience for patients while minimizing COVID-19 exposure and in-person healthcare utilization.Remote patient monitoring appears to be an effective approach for managing COVID-19 symptoms at home.© The Author(s) 2020.

32391441, Second, multi-sectoral efforts to offer incentives for those with no or minor symptoms to seek care and to quarantine themselves are critical, which would need concerted efforts from payers, providers, and public health.
32391441, Third, sustained and routine prevention efforts involving both the public and the health systems will prove to be useful in times of a pandemic.
32391441, Fourth, a strong public health system is essential and will be appreciated at times of urgency.

32391242, Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases.
32391242, Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) were increased in severe patients.
32391242, These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation.Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out.
32391242, Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

32388451, In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic.
32388451, In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population.
32388451, Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment.In this paper we report on a patient treated with natalizumab for relapsing MS who developed COVID-19 and recovered in a few days without complications.After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms.This case supports the opportunity to avoid discontinuing or delaying the retreatment over 8 weeks in patients recovered from a recent COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32386464,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) disease has led to a wide-spread global pandemic (1).
32386464, COVID-19 symptoms and mortality are disproportionately more severe in people with obesity and obesity related comorbidities (2, 3).

32386433, However, despite our best efforts to mitigate viral transmission, many of our migraine patients may eventually be exposed to SARS-CoV2.
32386433, While most patients will have mild to moderate symptoms, a subset will become severely ill, with possible complications including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32386433, Given the possibility of this level of severe respiratory illness, we should consider what effect blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) might have on these patients.This article is protected by copyright.

32384917,Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presently become a rapidly spreading and devastating global pandemic.
32384917, Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may serve as life-saving rescue therapy for refractory respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory compromise such as that induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32384917, While still little is known on the true efficacy of ECMO in this setting, the natural resemblance of seasonal influenza's characteristics with respect to acute onset, initial symptoms, and some complications prompt to ECMO implantation in most severe, pulmonary decompensated patients.
32384917, The present review summarizes the evidence on ECMO management of severe ARDS in light of recent COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time focusing on differences and similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO in terms of hematological and inflammatory interplay when these two settings merge.
32384516, While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result.She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody.
32384516, She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability.She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family's wishes and passed away.With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems.
32384516, While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections.
32384516, The alarming increase in cases per day adds additional pressure to find a cure and decrease the global health burden and mortality rate.
32384159, In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days.Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2020.

32384004, Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care.
32384004, These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring.
32384004, These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment.
32384004, To continue to deliver quality care for this patient population, palliative medicine must adapt quickly.
32383778, Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32383778, However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019.
32383778, We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19.Brief report.A university hospital in Saudi Arabia.A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever.The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up.Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2.The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32383778, Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.© 2020 The American Geriatrics Society.
32383370, Their prevalence was significantly more common among females and younger individuals (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively).
32383370, Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks.
32383370, The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms.

32383284, The patient was not a percutaneous coronary intervention candidate due to the extent of the dissection and was not a surgical candidate due to a lack of graftable target and medical management was continued.
32383284, To our knowledge, this case is the first in which SCAD has been reported in the LAD in a patient with COVID-19 with no other symptoms of respiratory illness or symptoms classically associated with the novel coronavirus.

32382463, Clinicians should be aware that rhabdomyolysis can be an initial presentation of COVID-19 or can occur at any time during the disease course.
32382463, Patients with rhabdomyolysis should receive aggressive fluid administration to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI).
32382463, However, COVID-19 patients are at risk of worsening oxygenation and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from fluid overload.
32382463, Therefore, cautious fluid administration is needed in COVID-19 patients with rhabdomyolysis.Copyright © 2020, Suwanwongse et al.
32382001, Neonates appeared to be affected to a greater extent.
32382001, A death was reported in a premature newborn whose mother had COVID-19 pneumonia.
32382001, There did not appear to be vertical transmission from mother to child.
32382001, Nevertheless, this information was not conclusive.COVID-19 appears to be more benign with pregnant women than with their neonates.
32381147, In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE.
32381147, In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure.
32381147, No patient-HCW transmission was detected despite intensive surveillance.Our institution successfully utilized the strategy of an RSW over a 6-week period to contain a cluster of COVID-19 cases and to prevent patient-HCW transmission.
32381147, However, this method was resource-intensive in terms of testing and bed capacity.
32381140, Hospitals, specialties, and professional groups are spurring one another on to adopt progressively more aggressive measures in response to COVID-19 that often exceed federal and international standards.
32381140, Examples include universal masking of providers and patients; decreasing thresholds to test asymptomatic patients; using face shields and N95 respirators regardless of symptoms and test results; novel additions to the list of aerosol-generating procedures; and more comprehensive personal protective equipment including hair, shoe, and leg covers.
32381140, Here, we review the factors underlying this arms race, including fears about personal safety, ongoing uncertainty around how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, confusion about what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure, increasing recognition of the importance of asymptomatic infection, and the limited accuracy of diagnostic tests.
32381140, We consider the detrimental effects of a maximal infection control approach and the research studies that are needed to eventually de-escalate hospitals and to inform more evidence-based and measured strategies.
32380803,As of 29 April 2020, across the globe, there are 3,216,353 confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease) with 227,894 deaths.
32380803, The health care infrastructure of most of the countries is overwhelmed due to the gigantic upsurge of the new cases within a short time period.
32380803, Most of the beds in the regular wards and critical care units are currently occupied by either people under investigation (PUI) or COVID-19 confirmed cases.
32380803, We hereby discuss the challenges faced while approaching any case of shortness of breath, or other common upper respiratory symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic era.
32380474, Endocrinologists must supervise the fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. • Patients after pituitary surgery should only drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of postoperative SIAD.
32380474, They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. • Hyponatraemia is common in patients with pneumonia, but it is unclear if it is only a marker of disease severity or if its correction improves outcomes.
32380474, Its prevalence in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. • In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU most probably due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics.
32380474, Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high rate of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. • IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.
32380337, Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), whereas indications were modified for nonurgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%).Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines.
32380337, Differences in practice might be related to the perception of the pandemic and significant differences in the health systems.
32380337, Sharing data and experiences will be of paramount importance to address the present moment and challenges in the near future.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32379731, Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
32379731, Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered.
32379731, Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3).
32379731, Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).
32379502, When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic.
32379502, The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available.
32379502, Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies. [Editor's Note: This Fast Track Ahead Of Print article is the accepted version of the peer-reviewed manuscript.
32379502, The final edited version will appear in an upcoming issue of Health Affairs.].
32379417, We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons.
32379417, These data suggest that sustentacular cells are involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and impairment of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients.
32379417, We also show that expression of the entry proteins increases in animals of old age.
32379417, This may explain, if true also in humans, why individuals of older age are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32379077, While multiple guidelines have been issued regarding autopsy protocol in cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths, there is some variability in the recommendations.
32379077, Additionally, limited recommendations to date have been issued regarding scene investigative protocol, and there are a paucity of publications characterizing COVID-19 postmortem gross and histologic findings.
32379077, A case of sudden unexpected death due to COVID-19 is presented as a means of illustrating common autopsy findings, as well as diagnostic and biosafety considerations.
32379077, We also review and summarize the current COVID-19 literature in an effort to provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy.
32378854, His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms.
32378854, However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient.
32378854, Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues.
32378854, Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32378030, ACE2 is a key part of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and a counterbalance to angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) and angiotensin II.
32378030, Angiotensin II is proinflammatory, is vasoconstrictive, and promotes organ damage.
32378030, Depletion of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 may tip the balance in favor of the "harmful" ACE1/angiotensin II axis and promote tissue injury including stroke.
32378030, There is a rationale to continue to treat with tissue plasminogen activator for COVID-19-related stroke and low molecular weight heparinoids may reduce thrombosis and mortality in sepsis-induced coagulopathy.
32377594, Conjunctival scrapings and swabs did not identify any bacteria or virus.
32377594, To our knowledge, we described the first case of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis in a COVID-19 patient.Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is present in tears and conjunctival secretions, external ocular infections could be factors of infectious spreading.

32377469,Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic is currently one of the most influential topics as it not only impacts the field of medicine but most importantly, it affects the lives of many individuals throughout the world.
32377469, We report an interesting 2019-nCoV case in a tertiary community hospital with the initial concern of acute pyelonephritis without respiratory symptoms that ultimately led to the quarantine of a number of healthcare providers.
32377469, This case emphasizes the importance of radiological evidence in diagnosing 2019-nCoV in the setting of an initial atypical presentation.
32377469, It also serves as an example of how healthcare providers may need to increase their suspicion for COVID-19 to ensure self-protection and prompt diagnosis in the era of an ongoing pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Zhang et al.
32376543, Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia.
32376543, We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia.Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms.
32376543, Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like "crazy-paving" patterns.
32376543, The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a "dandelion clek-like" sign and 37 with a "dandelion seed sign". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.
32376397, Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients.
32376397, In this review, we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with COVID-19, which should help reducing morbidity and mortality.
32376397, In this era, we suggest 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 based on the immunological point of view.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32376309, In two of the three incubation period patients, the viral titer in the presymptomatic period was very high (Ct value<20).
32376309, The median number of days to first negative RT-PCR in the asymptomatic carriers was 4.5 (range 2.5-9), and all asymptomatic carriers reached a first RT-PCR Ct>35 within 14 days after diagnosis.

32375887, People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns.
32375887, Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses.
32375887, Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids.
32375887, Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is indicated is important.
32374806, Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population.
32374806, The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued.
32374806, Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues.
32374806, The authors propose psychological interventions for prevention and treatment in order to mitigate the pandemic's psychological impacts.
32374457, A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry revealed that only the FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n- and S-o-mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10-μM concentration.
32374457, In-silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n- and S-o-mediated membrane fusion.
32374457, Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells.
32374457, These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV-2 symptoms appear.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32374208, First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers.
32374208, If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created.
32374208, Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients.
32374208, Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance.
32374033,During the COVID-19 pandemic, chilblains-like lesions have been reported in mildly symptomatic children and adolescents.
32374033, We present four children investigated for suspected COVID-19 infection with who presented with acral skin findings and mild systemic symptoms.

32372752, Based on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing, the patient was found to be negative for COVID-19.
32372752, He subsequently developed a diffuse rash and had serology consistent with dengue and measles.
32372752, The patient was treated symptomatically, and his condition gradually improved over 7 days.
32372752, This case highlights the high prevalence of many tropical diseases in low-income countries and the need for clinicians to consider alternate diagnoses in addition to testing for COVID-19 during the pandemic.
32371563, During this pandemic, it is recommended that patients with asthma continue taking all controller inhalers and other asthma medication as prescribed to prevent exacerbations and limit outpatient clinic and emergency room exposure.
32371563, Symptoms that may differentiate COVID-19 from asthma exacerbations caused by another trigger may include fever, fatigue, anorexia, or myalgias.

32370116, Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.
32370116, Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.
32370116, Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively.
32370116, This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.
32369975, However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures.
32369975, A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high.
32369975, Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully.
32369975, This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.

32367847, The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections.
32367847, In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
32367847, We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19.
32367847, The present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19.
32367837, While patients typically present with fever and symptoms of a respiratory illness, patients have also presented with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

32367837, In this article, we review gastrointestinal and liver aspects of COVID-19.
32367837, In addition, we provide general gastroenterologists with guidance on the management of patients with gastrointestinal and liver disorders from COVID-19.
32367205, High-dose steroid treatment allowed neurological and respiratory recovery.
32367205, We speculated a delayed immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32367205, The virus may lead to a SIRS-like immune disorder or play a role of infective trigger.
32367205, Prompt invasive treatment should be adopted to avoid hypoxic neurotoxicity and prevent CNS injuries.
32366658, On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports.
32366658, These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse.

32366299, At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4 weeks.
32366299, This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys.A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection.
32366299, While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic.
32366299, We further call for loss of sense of smell to be formerly recognised as a marker of COVID-19 infection.
32365944, Among the SUD subdomains, SUD-MC substantially activated AP-1-mediated CXCL10 expression in vitro.
32365944, In the wild type mice, SARS-CoV SUD-MC triggered the pulmonary infiltration of macrophages and monocytes, inducing CXCL10-mediated inflammatory responses and severe diffuse alveolar damage symptoms.
32365944, Moreover, SUD-MC actuated NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-dependent pulmonary inflammation, as confirmed by the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor and the NLRP3-/- mouse model.
32365944, This study demonstrated that SARS-CoV SUD modulated NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent CXCL10-mediated pulmonary inflammation, providing the potential therapeutic targets for developing the antiviral agents.
32364119, Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term.

32352957, During the same period, the team in Seattle, Washington, also tested residents and staff members at 12 shelters where a single case in each had been identified.
32352957, In Atlanta, Georgia, a team proactively tested residents and staff members at two shelters with no known COVID-19 cases in the preceding 2 weeks.
32352957, In each city, the objective was to test all shelter residents and staff members at each assessed facility, irrespective of symptoms.
32352957, Persons who tested positive were transported to hospitals or predesignated community isolation areas.
32352450, Only 51% reported the recognized symptoms of cough or fever.
32352450, A major limitation of this series however, was a lack of access to testing to confirm the COVID-19 status of the patients(2); in the 80 who had been tested 74% were positive.

32351807, Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.Copyright © 2020, Cipriano et al.
32351103,COVID-19 infection, a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV virus, and the World Health Organization declared this increasingly spreading disease as a global public health emergency (pandemic).
32351103, In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as the reference standard test.
32351103, In the early stages, thorax CT findings could be present even before the onset of symptoms, thorax CT has quite high sensitivity in COVID-19 patients with false negative RT-PCR results, and it has a great importance not only in diagnosis but also in follow up (6,7).
32351103, We think that it might be beneficial for our radiologist colleagues in the early diagnosis of the imaging features of this disease, by sharing the experiences we have gained by evaluating the typical and relatively atypical CT findings regarding the natural course of the tomographic findings of COVID-19 and when to control CT.

32349035, Two possible "L" and "S" SNP found in ORF1ab and ORF8 regions are detected CONCLUSION:: We perform genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequence of SARS-CoV-2.
32349035, Studies about the biological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in clinic animal and humans will manipulate an understanding the origin of pandemic crisis.
32348111, Here, we have highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory bulb.
32348111, From the olfactory bulb, SARS-CoV-2 may target the deeper parts of the brain including the thalamus and brainstem by trans-synaptic transfer described for many other viral diseases.
32348111, Following this, the virus might infect the respiratory center of brain, which could be accountable for the respiratory breakdown of COVID-19 patients.
32348111, Therefore, it is important to screen the COVID-19 patients for neurological symptoms as well as possibility of the collapse of the respiratory center in the brainstem should be investigated in depth.
32348051, Waiting for scientific confirmation and in the context of the current pandemic, it seems essential to consider any patient with a new anosmia as being infected with SARS-CoV-2 until proven otherwise.
32348051, These patients should therefore isolate themselves and remain alert to the occurrence of other symptoms suggestive of the infection and/or be tested.
32348051, Topical and systemic corticosteroids and nose washes are contraindicated.
32348051, The natural course of anosmia seems to be favorable in most cases.
32348047, Older patients do not always present with typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnoea) but sometimes are and remain asymptomatic (contact screening), or have aspecific presentations (altered general condition, falls, delirium, unusual fatigue).
32348047, Rectal swab, which minimizes exposition risk, appears useful in long-term care patients with diarrhea.
32348047, Older age is associated with worse prognosis, but the analysis should be refined by means of prognostic indexes that account for the heterogeneous health, functional, and cognitive status of the elderly population.
32348047, Gathering elderly patients' wishes and assessing their remaining life expectancy allows to anticipate care decisions according to the level of tension in the health system.
32347747, Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19.
32347747, Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis.
32347747, Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin.
32347747, Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.
32347200,Healthcare workers (n = 803) with mild symptoms were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 90 positive) and asked to complete a symptom questionnaire.
32347200, Anosmia, muscle ache, ocular pain, general malaise, headache, extreme tiredness and fever were associated with positivity.
32347200, A predictive model based on these symptoms showed moderate discriminative value (sensitivity: 91.2%; specificity: 55.6%).
32347200, While our models would not justify presumptive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis without molecular confirmation, it can contribute to targeted screening strategies.
32346373, Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8).
32346373, A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0-7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3-8.5).Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32346373, The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor.

32342928, Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness.
32342928, Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients.
32342928, Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab.Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield.
32342928, Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others.
32342849, This was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and since then has become widespread globally.
32342849, We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms).

32342849, This case demonstrates that viral shedding after COVID-19 diagnosis can be prolonged.
32342112, Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic.We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms.
32342112, We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines.
32342112, We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments.
32342112, Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.

32339250, Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening.
32339250, Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation.
32339250, Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus.
32339250, This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.

32337143, The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
32337143, It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
32337143, Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
32337143, Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.Copyright © 2020, Pal et al.

32333603, Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact.
32333603, The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department.We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting.
32333603, These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts.
32333603, The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.

32330593, After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month.
32330593, Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales.Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32330593, We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32329971, As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).
32329971, Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.
32329971, More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.

32322478, We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32322478, A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use.
32322478, Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms.Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing "cytokine storm syndrome" and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.© 2020 The Authors.

32322400, Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings.
32322400, Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32322400, Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.

32322102, The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection.
32322102, This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread.
32322102, We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures.
32322102, Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32321905, We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine.
32321905, Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited.
32321905, There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.
32321905, Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32321540, In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age.
32321540, For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection.
32321540, Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients.
32321540, Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID-19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure.Pediatric rheumatologists are expected to play a supporting role in this new front of COVID-19 pandemic, both as general pediatricians treating infected children, and as rheumatologists taking care of their rheumatic patients, as well as offering their experience in the possible alternative use of immunomodulatory drugs.
32319971, Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority.
32319971, Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4).
32319971, Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8).
32319971, However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.
32319129, Most countries affected by COVID-19 have opted for nationwide confinement, which means that communication with the primary clinician is often performed by telemedicine.
32319129, Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines.

32319041, Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR = 8.71, 95%CI:1.97-38.43), being the enterprise employee (OR = 2.36, 95%CI:1.09-5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR = 1.05, 95%CI:1.03-1.07) and using negative coping styles (OR = 1.03, 95%CI:1.00-1.07).
32319041, Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems.
32319041, Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health.
32319041, Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.
32316712, Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation.
32316712, During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
32316712, When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them.
32316712, At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.
32315756, In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed.
32315756, Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention, or being diagnosed as carriers.
32315756, Thus, managing the asymptomatic subjects, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while the pandemic is looming.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32314249, In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery.
32314249, Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging.
32314249, Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
32314010, Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated.
32314010, The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine.
32314010, Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved.
32314010, Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications.
32313807, GBS in commonly encountered after an antecedent trigger, most commonly an infection.
32313807, To date, only one case of GBS associated with this infection has been described.
32313807, Clinicians should consider this entity since it may warrant appropriate isolation precautions especially in a patient who may not present primarily with typical constitutional and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19.© 2020 The Author(s).

32312163, Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers.
32312163, However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis.
32312163, The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes.
32312163, Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.
32311836, Not quite half of participants (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior 2 weeks.
32311836, Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications, including hydroxychloroquine.After 2 weeks, many participants with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their health care, with many altering medications without professional consultation or because of hydroxychloroquine shortage.

32309812,SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a pneumonia that was identified through fever, dyspnea, and acute respiratory symptoms and named COVID-19.
32309812, This disease exacerbates in a number of patients and causes pulmonary edema, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32309812, Prevalence of ARDS among COVID-19 patients has been reported to be up to 17%. Among the introduced treatment methods for management of ARDS patients, prone position can be used as an adjuvant therapy for improving ventilation in these patients.
32309812, Here we reviewed the literature regarding the role of prone position in management of COVID-19 patients.
32309388, We report the screening and diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital.Developed a procedure for the identification of children cases with COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency department of our hospital, then we observed how this process works.(I) There were 56 cases considered suspected cases, and 10 cases were confirmed as COVID-19. (II) Of the 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in our hospital, 5 were males and 5 were females, aged from 7 months to 11 years, the average age is 6.0±4.2 years, 6 cases were mild pneumonia, the others were upper respiratory tract infection. (III) We followed up 68 patients in isolation at home until symptoms disappeared.
32309388, Non were missed in the patient's first visit.
32309388, The sensitivity of this method is 100% and the specificity is 71.3%.Our screening process works well, and it is also necessary to establish a screening network in the hospital.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32309266, Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.
32309266, Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome.
32309266, In line with the current opinion of the WHO, we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of COVID-19 are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks.
32309266, We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission.The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide.Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies.Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.© EFIM 2020.

32301746, Conclusions Combining appropriate cutoffs for certain hematological parameters could help in identifying false-positive/negative rRT-PCR tests.
32301746, Blood test analysis might be used as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19-positive patients in those countries which suffer from a large shortage of rRT-PCR reagents and/or specialized laboratory.
32301692, The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations.
32301692, In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues.
32301692, The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff.
32301692, In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come.
32301631, CONCLUSION.
32301631, COVID-19 infection can present primarily with abdominal symptoms, and the abdominal radiologist must suggest the diagnosis when evaluating the lung bases for typical findings.
32301600, In this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women, and discuss the current evidence of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and its potential consequences for assisted reproductive treatments.
32301600, Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks.
32301600, However, considering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles.
32301600, New evidence must be considered carefully in order to adjust these recommendations accordingly at any time and to guide assisted reproductive treatments.
32301300, It can also increase the number of people tested by 9-10 fold.
32301300, However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths.
32301300, These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant.
32301300, A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.
32301284, No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.

32300370,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its inordinately rapid spread is posing severe challenges to the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide, health care systems and the global economy.
32300370, While many younger people experience no or mild symptoms on infection, older adults are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and systemic conditions which demand a full understanding and leveraging of knowledge of the differences between immunity in young and old people.
32300370, Consequently, we welcome papers addressing any issues relevant to immunity and ageing in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and will endeavour to fast-track peer-review.
32300370, We aim to provide a platform exclusively for discussions of individual and age differences in susceptibility and immune responses to COVID caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and how to prevent or reduce severity of disease in older adults.© The Author(s) 2020.
32299636, We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement.Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms.

32299205, During the care of these patients, HCP should wear their personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with the procedure and should not neglect hand hygiene.
32299205, The samples of the patient with known or suspected COVID-19, patient should also be known to be risky in terms of contamination, and a risk assessment should be performed for the procedures to be performed in laboratories.
32299205, The PPE should be used in accordance with the procedure to be performed.

32298803, Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients.
32298803, The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings.
32298803, Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32298249, To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results.
32298249, Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient.
32298249, Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.
32298249, Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.
32298247, Among HCP patients with data on health care, household, and community exposures, 780 (55%) reported contact with a COVID-19 patient only in health care settings.
32298247, Although 4,336 (92%) HCP patients reported having at least one symptom among fever, cough, or shortness of breath, the remaining 8% did not report any of these symptoms.
32298247, Most HCP with COVID-19 (6,760, 90%) were not hospitalized; however, severe outcomes, including 27 deaths, occurred across all age groups; deaths most frequently occurred in HCP aged ≥65 years.
32298247, These preliminary findings highlight that whether HCP acquire infection at work or in the community, it is necessary to protect the health and safety of this essential national workforce.
32297828, In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity.
32297828, If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.
32296046, Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring.
32296046, Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID-19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, χ2 (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p < 0.001.There is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID-19 screening practices and availability of screening kits.
32296046, People living with SCI/D are expressing legitimate and real concerns about their vulnerability to COVID-19.
32296046, More and rapid work is needed to address these concerns and to standardize best-practice protocols throughout the rehabilitation community.
32473596, Although these therapies may have direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action, including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects, have been postulated.
32473596, Based on survey results from this group of authors, we suggest research priorities for specific agents and subgroups of patients with COVID-19.
32473596, Further, we review other agents, including immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties.

32473082, Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses, and had a wider distribution in Korea.
32473082, Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species.
32473082, Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co-roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats.This article is protected by copyright.

32473068,COVID-19 has created the necessity to rapidly generate evidence to enlighten many blind spots encompassing the pandemic, from pathophysiology to management.
32473068, Scientific journals have timely responded to this challenge by prioritizing COVID-19 research, with proactive editorial efforts favoring open-access to articles, launching calls for papers, implementing specific sections and special issues on COVID-19, among others.
32473068, However, the impact of all these measures on the overall quality and adequacy of research are largely unknown and several authors have shown concern in this regard.This article is protected by copyright.

32473051, This scenario raises concerns about Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETS) which might potentially have propagated inflammation and thrombosis via platelets' aggregation leading to enhanced coagulopathy and massive coronary thrombosis.
32473051, Therefore, we suggest primary PCI as the first-choice of revascularization in patients with combined COVID-19 and STEMI.
32473051, Additionally, we emphasize on the importance of using the potent new generation P2Y12 inhibitors along with GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to achieve favorable conditions for primary PCI as well as favorable outcomes after stent implantation.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32473049, Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R0 is sensitive to the applied mean generation time.
32473049, To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to estimate R0 number in Qom.
32473049, To control the epidemic, the number of reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the contact rate, decreasing transmission probability and decreasing the duration of the infectious period.This article is protected by copyright.

32472939, We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission.
32472939, As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising.
32472939, However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
32472939, These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.

32472898, Powered air purifying respirators are supplied even shorter than N95 masks, but strongly believed they are important for our team safety and protection.
32472898, This mini review provides fundamental knowledge on otologic surgery feasibility in the COVID-19 pandemic from an objective perspective.
32472763, One surface glycoprotein fragment of 111 amino acids is the largest, conserved, common permutation in the examined bat SARS-like and human SARS viruses, including the Covid-19 virus.
32472763, BLAST analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat SARS strains.
32472763, This fragment likely is involved in infectivity and is of interest for vaccine development.
32472763, Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein sequence homologies of 58.9% and 82.5%, respectively, between the novel SARS0CoV-2 strains and the human SARS (2018) virus suggest that existing anti-SARS vaccines may provide some protection against the novel coronavirus.
32472685, The trocar system was effective for posterior surgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures, and afforded a superior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches.
32472685, Aerosolization was reduced using both the mask and nasal trocar.The ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a critical role in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era.
32472685, The nasal trocar may be a useful alternative in instances where 3D printing is not available.

32472591,The sudden and rapid advancement of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unanticipated and unprecedented global crisis.
32472591, Since its emergence in the United States, there is increasing discussion surrounding the impact of the virus among vulnerable populations.
32472591, Older adults, young children, and persons with chronic medical or mental health conditions, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, immunocompromised persons and those who are institutionalized or homeless are considered most vulnerable to death and lost quality of life (World Health Organization, 2020).This article is protected by copyright.

32471830, Uncertainty and dread are exacerbated by the belief that what we are experiencing is new and mysterious.
32471830, However, deadly pandemics and disease emergences are not new phenomena: they have been challenging human existence throughout recorded history.
32471830, Some have killed sizeable percentages of humanity, but humans have always searched for, and often found, ways of mitigating their deadly effects.
32471830, We here review the ancient and modern histories of such diseases, discuss factors associated with their emergences, and attempt to identify lessons that will help us meet the current challenge.Copyright © 2020 Morens et al.
32471829, Moreover, the high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals make wet-lab studies currently challenging.
32471829, In this study, we used a series of computational strategies to identify several fast-evolving regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which are potentially under host immune pressure.
32471829, Most notably, the hitherto-uncharacterized protein encoded by ORF8 is one of them.
32471829, Using sensitive sequence and structural analysis methods, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-coronavirus comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential immune modulators to delay or attenuate the host immune response against the viruses.Copyright © 2020 Tan et al.
32471712, In this review, we outline the risk and benefits of primary PCI vs. thrombolysis for STEMI.
32471712, While thrombolysis may seem like a good choice, many patients have a contraindication and could end-up using more resources.
32471712, Also, with a high probability of the angiogram showing non-obstructed coronary arteries during acute infections, primary PCI should be the preferred strategy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32471334, Using a "plug-and-display" SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, we coupled RBD to lumazine synthase (LS) particles producing multimeric RBD-presenting particles (RBD-LS).
32471334, RBD-LS vaccination induced antibody responses of high magnitude and quality (avidity, MERS-CoV neutralizing capacity, and mucosal immunity) with cross-clade neutralization.
32471334, The antibody responses were associated with blocking viral replication and upper and lower respiratory tract protection against MERS-CoV infection in rabbits.
32471334, This arrayed multivalent presentation of the viral RBD using the antigen-SpyTag/LS-SpyCatcher is a promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidate and this platform may be applied for the rapid development of vaccines against other emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.
32471272, The protective role of&nbsp;estrogens, as well as an immune-suppressive activity that limits the excessive inflammation, can be mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2).
32471272, The role of this receptor in modulating inflammation and immune response is well documented in fact in several settings.
32471272, The stimulation of CB2 receptors is known to limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, shift the macrophage phenotype towards the anti-inflammatory M2 type and enhance the immune-modulating properties of mesenchymal stromal cells.
32471272, For these reasons, we hypothesize that CB2 receptor can be a therapeutic target in COVID-19 pandemic emergency.
32471205, Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses.
32471205, In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results.
32471205, Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate.
32471205, Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 µM, respectively.
32471083,The authors performed a narrative review on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- CoronaVirus-2 ( SARS-CoV-2) and all infectious agents with the primary endpoints to illustrate the most accepted models of safety protocols in dentistry and oral medicine, and to propose an easy view of the problem and a comparison (pre- vs post-COVID19) for the most common dental procedures.
32471083, The outcome is forecast to help dentists to individuate for a given procedure the differences in terms of safety protocols to avoid infectious contagion (by SARS-CoV-2 and others dangerous agents).
32471083, An investigation was performed on the online databases Pubmed and Scopus using a combination of free words and Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms: "dentist" OR "oral health" AND "COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "coronavirus-19". After a brief excursus on all infectious agents transmittable at the dental chair, the authors described all the personal protective equipment (PPE) actually on the market and their indications, and on the basis of the literature, they compared (before and after COVID-19 onset) the correct safety procedures for each dental practice studied, underlining the danger of underestimating, in general, dental cross-infections.
32471083, The authors have highlighted the importance of knowing exactly the risk of infections in the dental practice, and to modulate correctly the use of PPE, in order to invest adequate financial resources and to avoid exposing both the dental team and patients to preventable risks.
32471056, A highly enhanced anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody response was induced when mice were immunized with rASP-1 and the alum-adjuvanted RBD vaccine in two separate injection sites as compared to mice immunized with RBD + rASP-1 + alum formulated into a single inoculum.
32471056, The antibodies produced also significantly inhibited the binding of RBD to its cell-associated receptor.
32471056, Moreover, immunization with rASP-1 co-administered with the alum-adjuvanted RBD vaccine in separate sites resulted in an enhanced frequency of TfH and GC B cells within the draining lymph nodes, both of which were positively associated with the titers of the neutralizing antibody response related to anti-MERS-CoV protective immunity.
32471056, Our findings not only indicate that this unique combinatorial adjuvanted RBD vaccine regimen improved the immunogenicity of RBD, but also point to the importance of utilizing combinatorial adjuvants for the induction of synergistic protective immune responses.
32471003,There has been an explosion of data published in a short period of time about COVID-19.
32471003, It can be difficult for learners to stay on top of the latest information while also critically appraising each new piece of information.

32470889, An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein.
32470889, Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies.
32470889, SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples.
32470889, The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.Published by Elsevier B.V.
32470887, Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene.LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2.
32470887, Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs.
32470887, The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF.A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32470751, Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging.
32470751, Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.
32470751, The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32470046, Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3).Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose.
32470046, At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units.Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood.
32470046, Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other.
32470046, Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.
32469855,Using a mathematical model, we explore the problem of availability versus overdemand of critical hospital processes (e.g., critical beds) in the face of a steady epidemic expansion such as is occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic.
32469855, In connection with the statistics of new cases per day, and the assumption of maximum quota, the dynamics associated with the variables number of hospitalized persons (critical occupants) and mortality in the system are explored.
32469855, A parametric threshold condition is obtained, which involves a parameter associated with the minimum daily effort for not collapsing the system.
32469855, To exemplify, we include some simulations for the case of Chile, based on a parameter of effort to be sustained with the purpose of lowering the daily infection rate.
32469853, Three scenarios were estimated: Scenario 1 with official MINSAL data; scenario 2 with official MINSAL data and recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health; and scenario 3 with official MINSAL data, recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health, and without considering deaths in the total recovered.
32469853, There are considerable differences between scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3 in the number of deaths, active patients, and duration of the disease.
32469853, Scenario 3, considered the most adverse, estimates a total of 11,000 infected people, 1,151 deaths, and that the peak of the disease will occur in the first days of May.
32469853, We concluded that the concept of recovered may be decisive for the epidemiological forecasts of COVID-19 in Chile.
32469246, The psychophysical olfactory evaluation reported that anosmia and hyposmia occurred in 24 (52%) and 11 (24%) patients, respectively.
32469246, Eleven patients were normosmic.
32469246, The viral load was significantly higher in patients of group 1 compared with those of group 2.Coronavirus disease 2019 was detected in a high proportion of ISOA patients, especially over the first 12 days of olfactory dysfunction.
32469246, Anosmia is an important symptom to consider in the detection of COVID-19 infection.
32469114, ACE-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2), a monocarboxypeptidase that had been discovered 20 years ago, is one of the catalytically most potent enzymes known to degrade Ang II to Ang-(1-7), a peptide that is increasingly accepted to have organ -protective properties that oppose and counterbalance those of Ang II.
32469114, In addition to its role as a RAS enzyme ACE2 is the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
32469114, In this review, we discuss various strategies that have been used to achieve amplification of ACE2 activity including the potential therapeutic potential of soluble recombinant ACE2 protein and novel shorter ACE2 variants.This article is protected by copyright.

32468343, First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing Rt.
32468343, Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation.
32468343, Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life.
32468343, Our mathematical modeling provides evidence for international communities to develop sound design of containment and mitigation policies for COVID-19.
32468229, Disease stage represents the most important prognosis factor; therefore, early diagnosis is essential for melanoma patients' survival rates.
32468229, Following the outbreak in China, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread all over the world and the majority of dermatological visits have been postponed.
32468229, These measures could cause a delay in melanoma diagnosis and management leading to an increase of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.
32468229, Herein we propose an alternative model of skin cancer screening and the organization of screening campaigns in order to detect malignant lesions early during this emergency period.
32468155, Half of them felt horrified and helpless in 275 (53.9%), and 265 (52%) respectively, while 338 (66.3%) felt apprehensive. only 24.2% reported increased support from friends, while increased support from family members in 207 (40.6%). 46.5% shared their feelings with family members, while 176 (34.5%) shared with others.
32468155, Caring for family members' feelings increased in 330 (64.7%).
32468155, Age and rural residency were negative predictors for the impact of event score, while female gender or presence of chronic condition was a positive predictor for the impact of event score.
32468155, Covid-19 pandemic has a great psychological impact on adult Egyptians and affected social support.
32467432, For today, we need to address the current pandemic from the point of view of both control and suppression.
32467432, But such efforts could also provide insights into a post-pandemic restructuring of health care.
32467432, If one or several states succeed in addressing the COVID pandemic together with an associated modest economic resurgence, citizens could develop the trust in state leadership necessary to finally make fundamental changes in our health care system.
32467432, Such change is a once in a century opportunity.

32466757, These ethnic groups were more likely to be hospital cases compared to the white British.
32466757, Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables.
32466757, Socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 2.19 for most deprived quartile vs least (95% CI 1.80-2.66) and RR 2.00 for no qualifications vs degree (95% CI 1.66-2.42)).Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study, which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, baseline self-reported health or behavioural risk factors.
32466757, An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required.
32466654, Cognitive learning theory, strategies to promote learner engagement and minimise distraction, and examples of software affordances to support active learning during the lecture are proposed.

32466654, These suggestions will therefore enable HPE to better meet the existing and future needs of regional, rural and remote learners who may not be able to easily access face-to-face learning upon the relaxation of social distancing measures.
32466654, Strategies to provide equitable HPE to learners who cannot access plentiful, fast internet are also discussed.
32466598, A plausible mechanism involved in these impacts could be a positive energy balance promoted by maintaining usual dietary intake while reducing energy expenditure.
32466598, This means that just as calorie intake restriction could help mitigate the deleterious impacts of a bout of physical inactivity, overeating under conditions of home confinement is very likely to exacerbate these consequences.
32466598, Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been identified as potential risk factors for more severely ill patients with COVID-19.
32466598, Thus, adequate control of metabolic disorders could be important to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.
32466536, Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides.
32466536, Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders.
32466536, Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32466536, This review aimed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth summarization of the contribution of graphene-based nanomaterials in liquid biopsy, discussing the remaining challenges and the future trend; moreover, the paper gave the first look at the potentiality of graphene in COVID-19 diagnosis.
32466289, Little is known about the biological pathways associated in FIP pathogenesis.
32466289, This is the first study aiming to determine the phenotypic characteristics on the cellular level in relation to specific metabolic pathways of importance to FIP pathogenesis.The internalization of type II FIPV WSU 79-1146 in Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CrFK) cells was visualized using a fluorescence microscope, and optimization prior to phenotype microarray (PM) study was performed.
32466289, Then, four types of Biolog Phenotype MicroArray™ plates (PM-M1 to PM-M4) precoated with different carbon and nitrogen sources were used to determine the metabolic profiles in FIPV-infected cells.The utilization of palatinose was significantly low in FIPV-infected cells; however, there were significant increases in utilizing melibionic acid, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid and alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) compared to non-infected cells.This study has provided the first insights into the metabolic profiling of a feline coronavirus infection in vitro using PMs and deduced that glutamine metabolism is one of the essential metabolic pathways for FIPV infection and replication.
32466289, Further studies are necessary to develop strategies to target the glutamine metabolic pathway in FIPV infection.
32466106, Interestingly, 21.2% of responders increased their consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables.
32466106, Only 33.5% of those who declared decreased consumption attributed this change of diet to lower availability and ease of purchasing such items.
32466106, Equally interesting, over half of responders, i.e., 56.2%, admitted that fruit and vegetables did not appeal to them while in lockdown.
32466106, Purchases of ready-made meals were reduced by nearly 50%. Future large-scale similar studies should be undertaken worldwide and will help public health authorities shape their reactions to future, unavoidable pandemics.
32464695, The concentration decreased even further, to 0.8% of baseline with the enclosure closed with augmented airflow (suction on).
32464695, Aerosolized particulate contamination in the operating room can be decreased using a clear plastic enclosure with minimal openings and augmented airflow.
32464695, This may serve to decrease the exposure of healthcare providers to aerosolized pathogens.This article is protected by copyright.

32464668, What explains the anemic global response to date? This paper draws from structural international relations theory to suggest a partial but somewhat dissatisfying answer.
32464668, International organizations are inherently weak faced with opposition by major powers.
32464668, The international system simultaneously incentivizes states to cooperate and address common threats but at the same time encourages countries to take care of themselves, potentially at the expense of others.
32464668, Which of these motives dominates cannot be explained by structural theory, requiring us to look to other factors such as the attributes of states or of leaders themselves.Copyright © 2020 by Duke University Press.

32464584, However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS.In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19.
32464584, In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection.

32463794,Pathological signaling in the lung induced by particulate matter (PM) air pollution partially overlaps with that provoked by COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32463794, Metformin is capable of suppressing one of the molecular triggers of the proinflammatory and prothrombotic processes of urban PM air pollution, namely the mitochondrial ROS/Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC)/IL-6 cascade.
32463794, Given the linkage between mitochondrial functionality, ion channels, and inflamm-aging, the ability of metformin to target mitochondrial electron transport and prevent ROS/CRAC-mediated IL-6 release might illuminate new therapeutic avenues to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in older people.
32463794, The incorporation of infection rates, severity and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infections as new outcomes of metformin usage in elderly populations at risk of developing severe COVID-19, together with the assessment of bronchial/serological titers of inflammatory cytokines and D-dimers, could provide a novel mechanistic basis for the consideration of metformin as a therapeutic strategy against the inflammatory and thrombotic states underlying the gerolavic traits of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32463765, Of new patient referrals, 59% were for solid tumors (70 of 119 referrals; 42 metastatic and 28 nonmetastatic cancers), and 41% were hematology consultations (49 of 119 referrals; 28 classical and 21 malignant hematologic conditions).
32463765, We estimate that Sevier Valley Hospital retained $3,605,500 in revenue over this 4-year period.Using a telehealth program in rural Utah, patients with cancer benefited from substantial time and monetary savings.
32463765, The local medical center was able to retain revenue it would have otherwise lost to outsourcing cancer care.
32463765, Recent regulatory changes to address the COVID-19 pandemic should increase the number of patients with cancer treated via telehealth nationwide.
32463742,During the current coronavirus pandemic, undergraduate nurse teaching is facing many challenges.
32463742, Universities have had to close their campuses, which means that academics are working from home and may be coping with unfamiliar technology to deliver the theoretical part of the undergraduate nursing curriculum.
32463742, Emergency standards from the Nursing and Midwifery Council have allowed theoretical instruction to be replaced with distance learning, requiring nursing academics to adapt to providing a completely virtual approach to their teaching.
32463742, This article provides examples of tools that can be used to deliver the theoretical component of the undergraduate nursing curriculum and ways of supporting students and colleagues in these unprecedented times.
32463716, Wellness activities centered on increased communication.
32463716, All programs had begun to use video-conferencing and the majority planned to continue using this.
32463716, Programs in states with higher incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to report resident redeployment (48% vs 11%, P=0.002) and exposure to COVID-19-positive patients (70% vs 40%, P=0.03) and were less likely to report concerns regarding exposure (78% vs 97%, P=0.02) and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability (62% vs 89%, P=0.02).As of April 1, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in significant changes in urology residency programs.
32463716, These findings inform a rapidly changing landscape and aid in development of best practices.
32463522, However, is R0 an appropriate and significant measure? Like many mathematics/statistical parameters, R0 is relatively easy to explain, more complicated to understand (even graphically), and very difficult to calculate, or use for modelling.

32463475, The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant.
32463475, Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies.
32463475, Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity.
32463475, Carefully selected serological POC tests for sars-cov-2 can be used in large scale testing but should only be used by licensed medical staff able to understand their limitations and interpret the results.

32463375, Generalised Additive Mixed Models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted.Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users.
32463375, In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
32463375, Calculation of Bayes Factors (BFs) indicated that the data for the primary analysis favoured the null hypothesis compared with large associations (BF for level = 0.25; BF for slope = 0.26) but were insensitive to detection of small associations (BF for level = 0.78; BF for slope = 1.35).In the UK, between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020, and between 1 January 2019 and 31 March 2020, there was no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a large step change or increasing trend in downloads of a popular smoking cessation app.

32463239, An idiosyncratic trait of coronaviruses is the presence of spike glycoproteins on the viral envelope, which mediate the virus binding to specific host receptor, enabling its entry into the human cells.
32463239, In spite of the high sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 with its closely related SARS-CoV emerged in 2002, the atomic-level determinants underlining the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and, thus, the rapid virus spread into human body, remain unresolved.
32463239, Here, multi-µs-long molecular dynamics simulations enabled us to unprecedentedly dissect the key molecular traits liable of the higher affinity/specificity of SARS-CoV-2 towards ACE2, as compared to SARS-CoV, supplying a minute per-residue contact map underlining its stunningly high infectivity.
32463239, Harnessing this knowledge is pivotal for urgently developing effective medical countermeasures to face the ongoing global health crisis.
32463221, Specifically, impaired redox homeostasis and associated oxidative stress appear to be important biological processes that may account for increased individual susceptibility to diverse environmental insults.
32463221, The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness.
32463221, The hypothesis that glutathione deficiency is the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in COVID-19 patients was proposed on the basis of an exhaustive literature analysis and observations.
32463221, The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.

32462988, In this work, we have utilized docking and simulation methods to identify small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins, which are essential for virus assembly and budding.
32462988, A total of 70 compounds from an Indian medicinal plant source (Azadirachta indica or Neem) were virtually screened against these two proteins and further analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations, which resulted in the identification of a few common compounds with strong binding to both structural proteins.
32462988, The compounds bind to biologically critical regions of M and E, indicating their potential to inhibit the functionality of these components.
32462988, We hope that our computational approach may result in the identification of effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 assembly.

32462703,In the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic-referred to as COVID-19-there has been much uncertainty.
32462703, We remain uncertain about its precise origin, its structure and composition, how best to test for it, or for resulting immunity, whether or not exposure leads to immunity, whether or not disposable surgical masks are effective, why men and some ethnic minorities are more susceptible and just exactly what the death rate as a result of this virus is.

32462701, There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32462701, These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease.
32462701, Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.This article is protected by copyright.

32462501, Four samples display a Ct < 22.0 for the E and RdRp genes while the N gene was not detected, suggesting a variability of the viral sequence.
32462501, There was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses.
32462501, The Allplex 2019-nCoV appears as a reliable method, but additional evaluations using more samples are needed.
32462501, RT-PCR assays should probably include at least 2 viral targets.
32462445, We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP.
32462445, The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary.One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56-0.85).
32462445, This model allowed for the identification of 8-50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients.Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases.
32462445, However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases.• Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans. • ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms. • Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases.
32462398, Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%).
32462398, Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%).
32462398, Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%).According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals.
32462398, New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.
32462314, Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns.
32462314, To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients.
32462314, We used publicly available datasets to achieve this.Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide.
32462314, As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans.Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient's CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy.
32462098, Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed.
32462098, Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak.
32462098, Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested.
32462098, Finally, this assessment process could help the government and policymakers to judge the public perceptions to deal with COVID-19 pandemic in densely populated lower-middle-income and limited-resource countries like Bangladesh.© 2020 The Author(s).

32461818, In conclusion, UHC does not appear to protect against mortality in a pandemic environment such as with COVID-19.Copyright: © 2020 Dongarwar and Salihu.
32461674, However, evidence accumulated over the past few decades increasingly suggests that vaccines can also have non-specific effects on unrelated infections and diseases, with important implications for childhood mortality particularly in low-income settings.
32461674, Furthermore, many of these non-specific effects, as well as the pathogen-specific effects, of vaccines show differences between the sexes.
32461674, Here, members of the Optimmunize consortium discuss the evidence for and potential mechanisms of non-specific and sex-differential effects of vaccines, as well as their potential policy implications.
32461674, Given that the non-specific effects of some vaccines are now being tested for their ability to protect against COVID-19, the authors also comment on the broader implications of these trials.
32461511, This study analyzes the real time data from March 1 to April 22, 2020 by adopting a sophisticated statistical modeling based on the state space model combined with the well-known susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model.
32461511, The model estimation and forecasting are conducted using the Bayesian methodology.
32461511, The present study provides the parameter estimates of the unknown parameters that critically determine the epidemic process derived from the SIR model and prediction of the future transition of the infectious proportion including the size and timing of the epidemic peak with the prediction intervals that naturally accounts for the uncertainty.
32461511, Even though the epidemic appears to be settling down during this intervention period, the prediction results under various scenarios using the data up to May 18 reveal that the temporary reduction in the infection rate would still result in a delayed the epidemic peak unless the long-term reproduction number is controlled.
32461412, In terms of psychological impact, 768 (32.6%) had some degree of depression; mild in 504 (21.4%), moderate in 163 (6.9%), and severe in 101 (4.3%).
32461412, Multivariable analysis showed that depression was significantly higher at younger age.
32461412, The odds of depression decreased by 3% with 1 year increase in age.
32461412, It was higher in non-practicing ophthalmologists, especially those who were considerably worried about their training or professional growth, and those with difficulty in meeting living expenses.A strikingly high proportion of ophthalmologists are psychologically affected and may require personalized mental health care.
32461409, The increased frequency of ABHR use and the aerosols generated pose a potential threat to the skin and exposed mucosal surfaces, especially that of the eye due to the proximity of use.

32461321, There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses.
32461321, All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and G-N-7 MTase activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively.
32461321, Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced higher type I and III interferons.
32461321, These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32461141, COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation.
32461141, The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death.
32461141, In this review we will discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multi-organ damage.Copyright © 2020.

32461062, In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown.
32461062, This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone.A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections.

32460458, We examined the in vitro activity of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2, at concentrations which can be used to treat coronavirus-19 patients with little concern of toxicity.Lopinavir/ritonavir (7/1.75 μg/mL), hydroxychloroquine base (1 or 2 μg/mL), or a combination thereof were administered 1 hour after the inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 to Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05.
32460458, We examined cytopathic effects of virus 48 hours after administration of the respective treatments and measured viral loads at three time points (0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared the results obtained from the different antiviral regimens tested.The severity of cytopathic effects was lower in lopinavir/ritonavir-treated cells, and viral load was significantly reduced in this group compared with the control group (p < 0.001).
32460458, However, hydroxychloroquine did not show significant inhibitory effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytotoxicity or on viral load at either concentration.Lopinavir/ritonavir showed significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at its usual plasma concentration.
32460458, However, the in vitro antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine at concentrations commonly used in humans was minimal, whether used alone or in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.
32460208, Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation.
32460208, Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections.
32460208, Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020.

32460185, Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump).
32460185, The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of ≥9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.
32460185, Overall, these findings are largely consistent with the results of the first CAS investigation and support the validity of this mental health screener for COVID-19 related research and practice.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32459668, For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed.
32459668, Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team.
32459668, If possible after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of healthcare worker infection.Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high-risk for all members of the procedural team.
32459668, To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.
32459647, Using the finalized operating classification scheme, clinicians in the study group assessed representative tongue images (n=24) that they had taken, and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of their assessments was evaluated.Intra-rater agreement between direct subject inspection and tongue image inspection was good to very good (Cohen K range 0.69-1.0).
32459647, Additionally, when comparing the assessment of tongue images on different days, intra-rater reliability was good to very good (K range 0.7-1.0), except for the color of the tongue body (K=0.22) and slippery tongue fur (K=0.1).
32459647, Inter-rater reliability was moderate for tongue coating (Gwet AC2 range 0.49-0.55), and fair for color and other features of the tongue body (Gwet AC2=0.34).Taken together, our study has shown that tongue images collected via smartphone contain some reliable features, including tongue coating, that can be used in mHealth analysis.
32459647, Our findings thus support the use of smartphones in telemedicine for detecting changes in tongue coating.
32459409,The purpose of this investigation is to assess the current utilization of telehealth capabilities at academic orthopaedic departments in the United States and to determine how practice patterns have been directly influenced by the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic.Orthopaedic surgery programs participating in the Electronic Residency Application Service were identified.
32459409, One hundred seventy-five (175) programs were presented with a seven-item questionnaire addressing whether each program is using telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Of the 175 Electronic Residency Application Service participant orthopaedic programs, 168 responded for a total response rate of 96%. Of the 106 institutions using telehealth services, 88 (83%) cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the impetus for implementation of telehealth services.
32459409, Institutions located in the Northeast and South regions were markedly more likely to offer telehealth services.
32459409, Heat map analysis demonstrates an associative overlap of regional "hot spots" with direct comparison of COVID-19 cases in the United States and orthopaedic departments providing telehealth services.This study demonstrates the impressive measures academic orthopaedic institutions are taking to meet the needs of our patients by identifying a notable increase in new telehealth offerings throughout the United States with a positive correlation with COVID-19 disease burden.
32459372, These drugs are known to induce an increased expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32459372, ACE2 acts as receptor for the novel SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which raising the important issue of possible detrimental effects that RAS blockers could exert on the natural history and pathogenesis of the COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) and associated excessive inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
32459372, We review the current knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and RAS blockers and suggest a scientific rationale for continuing RAS blockers therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32459144, Here, we applied a molecular docking method to study the binding stability of these drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32459144, It appeared that the ligand-protein binding stability of the alliin and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex was better than others.
32459144, The results suggested that alliin may serve as a good candidate as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32459144, Therefore, the present research may provide some meaningful guidance for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32459046, Cardiovascular disease and, in particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has emerged as an important consideration in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32459046, The diagnosis of VTE using standardized objective testing is problematic in these patients, given the risk of infecting non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and hospital personnel, coupled with the usual challenges of performing diagnostic testing in critically-ill patients.
32459046, Early reports suggest a high incidence of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe illness, that is similar to the high VTE rates observed in patients with other viral pneumonias, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).This article is protected by copyright.

32458823, The analyzed investigations state that it is best for the newborn to be breastfed; given that mother's milk samples were analyzed, detecting the presence of antibodies of the coronavirus in them, being a protective factor against infection.Breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the newborn, if the health of the mother and newborn allow it.
32458823, When direct breastfeeding is favoured, the appropriate respiratory hygiene measures always have to be considered.
32458823, Whether the mother's health does not permit direct breastfeeding, her breast milk should be previously extracted and kept unpasteurized.
32458823, To secure the newborn feeding, milk banks are also an appropriate option.
32458787,Globally, more than 4 million people have been infected with COVID-19, and more than 300,000 deaths have been reported across 188 countries.
32458787, Concealment of one's potential exposure to the virus has negative implications for the spread of COVID-19 across the socio-ecological spectrum, including the futility of contact-tracing efforts, exposure of frontline staff, and the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
32458787, We draw lessons learned from HIV to discuss stigma and the attribution of blame surrounding the phenomenon of concealment of one's potential exposure to COVID-19 using a socio-ecological perspective.
32458787, This article also illustrates the psychosocial aspect of the disease, and the negative repercussions of concealment of potential exposure on transmission in the community and to front-liners, healthcare resources, and outbreak containment.
32458694, In summary, ACEI/ARB therapy did not aggravate disease severity of COVID-19.
32458694, Besides, ACEI/ARB therapy can decrease the mortality of COVID-19.
32458694, Current evidence suggested that RAAS inhibitors should be continued in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
32458694, Future well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

32458565, Particularly in the ID-cohort, excess deaths also occurred in younger age groups, due to endocrine diseases and ID-specific causes.During the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic, excess mortality among people with ID was three times higher than in the general Dutch population, appeared more often at young age and with a broader range of underlying causes.
32458565, These findings suggest that a pandemic may disproportionally affect people with ID while population data may not immediately raise warnings.
32458565, Early detection of diverging patterns and faster implementation of tailored strategies therefore require collection of good quality data.© 2020 The Authors.

32458400, Emerging evidence suggests that patients with the highest rate of morbidity and mortality following SARS-CoV2 infection have also developed a hyperinflammatory syndrome (also termed cytokine release syndrome).
32458400, We lay out the potential contribution of a dysfunction in autonomic tone to the cytokine release syndrome and related multiorgan damage in COVID-19.
32458400, We hypothesize that a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway could be targeted as a therapeutic avenue.
32458400, Graphical Abstract .
32458382,In a few weeks, the global community has witnessed, and for some of us experienced first-hand, the human costs of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32458382, There is incredible variability in how countries are choosing to thwart the disease's outbreak, sparking intense discussions around what it means to teach and learn in the era of COVID-19, and more specifically, the role medical students play in the midst of the pandemic.
32458382, A multi-national and multi-institutional group made up of a dedicated medical student from Austria, passionate clinicians and educators from Switzerland, and a PhD scientist involved in Medical Education from Canada, have assembled to summarize the ingenious ways medical students around the world are contributing to emergency efforts.
32458382, They argue that such efforts change COVID-19 from a "disruption" to medical students learning to something more tangible, more important, allowing students to become stakeholders in the expansion and delivery of healthcare.
32458289, This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy.A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications.Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50.
32458289, Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy.
32458289, SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol.If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
32458289, Evidence-based research in this field is needed for definitive determination of safety.
32458267, Although the impetus for generating this document was the COVID-19 pandemic, recommendations should also be applicable for mitigating drug shortages outside of a pandemic.
32458267, Proposed provincial strategies for drug conservation and therapeutic alternatives may not all be appropriate for every institution.
32458267, Local implementation will require consultation from end-users and hospital administrators.
32458267, Competing equipment shortages and available resources should be considered when evaluating the appropriateness of each strategy.
32458111, Increase in SELE gene expression (gene coding for E-selectin protein) was confirmed in an independent cohort of 32 patients using a whole blood gene expression profile analysis.
32458111, In plasma, we found a strong association between angiopoetin-2 and CRP, creatinine and D-dimers (with p value at 0.001, 0.001 and 0.003, respectively).
32458111, ROC curve analysis identified an Angiopoietin-2 cut-off of 5000 pg/mL as the best predictor for ICU outcome (Se = 80.1%, Sp = 70%, PPV = 72.7%, NPV = 77%), further confirmed in multivariate analysis after adjustment for creatinine, CRP or D-dimers.Angiopoietin-2 is a relevant predictive factor for ICU direct admission in COVID-19 patients.
32458111, This result showing an endothelial activation reinforces the hypothesis of a COVID-19-associated microvascular dysfunction.
32456846, Different supporting entities are being set up to help this population.COVID-19 is a top priority.
32456846, It is important to remember that a substantial proportion of the world's population is affected by other co-morbidities such as diabetes.
32456846, These require special attention during this pandemic to avoid adding on to the burden of countries' healthcare systems.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32456346, Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number R and the dispersion parameter k (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13-0.88), respectively.
32456346, A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin.
32456346, In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January.
32456346, Our results highlighted more efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors.
32456123, Beneficial effects of the combined therapy were also seen in TCM syndrome score of cough (MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.34 to -1.03, p < 0.001), fever (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.45, p < 0.001), dry and sore throat (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.20, p = 0.009), and fatigue (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.17, p = 0.007).
32456123, The overall risk of bias of the included studies was unclear.
32456123, No serious adverse events were reported.Significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine were found, and revealed the potential role of herbal medicine in treating COVID-19.
32456123, More high-quality RCTs are needed to further validate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.
32456072, We conduct a preliminary analysis of general strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of the response strategies from a local perspective.
32456072, Furthermore, we provide firsthand insights on future directions and priorities to manage this unprecedented pandemic.
32456072, Our case report gives a qualitative view of the healthcare response, based on the experience of frontline professionals, with the aim to generate hypotheses about factors which may promote or hinder the prevention and management of a pandemic locally.
32456072, We highlight the importance of a public health approach for responding to COVID-19 and reshaping healthcare systems.
32455942, Recent comparisons of the genomes of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV, with less pathogenic strains (e.g., Bat-RaTG13, the bat homologue of SARS-CoV2) identified possible mutations in the receptor binding domain and in the S1 and S2' cleavage sites of their spike glycoprotein.
32455942, However, there remains some confusion on the relative roles of the possible serine proteases involved for priming.
32455942, Using anthrax toxin as a model system, we show that in vivo inhibition of priming by pan-active serine protease inhibitors can be effective at suppressing toxicity.
32455942, Hence, our studies should encourage further efforts in developing either pan-serine protease inhibitors or inhibitor cocktails to target SARS-CoV2 and potentially ward off future pandemics that could develop because of additional mutations in the S-protein priming sequence in coronaviruses.
32455807, To give a more realistic estimate of the lethality of COVID-19, we use the actual (March 2020) estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of the pandemic based on the minimum observed CFR and analyze data obtained from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, a good representation of a "laboratory" case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested.
32455807, From such analyses, we derive more realistic estimates of the real extent of the infection as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates.
32455807, We then isolate the dominant factors causing the abnormal severity of the disease in Italy.
32455807, Finally, we use the death count-the only data estimated to be reliable enough-to predict the total number of people infected and the interval of time when the infection in Italy could end.
32455550, According to the gender variable, our sample includes 405 men, or 59.7%, and 273 women, representing 40.3%. The results of the statistical analysis carried out using SPSS version 22.0 software showed that 50.3% of the respondents were in an anxious situation during these first three weeks of confinement.
32455550, In addition, 48.2% feels stressed, 46.6% of the respondents confirmed to be feeling in a bad mood, and 47.4% do not stop thinking throughout the day about this epidemic and how to protect themselves.
32455550, In addition, the study shows that 87.9% of the respondents in Algeria found it difficult to follow the confinement instructions.
32455550, A significant change in the habits of the population was noted especially for the time of going to bed, the time of waking up, and the use of the Internet as well as the hours devoted to daily reading.
32455534, After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound.
32455534, In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing.
32455534, Furthermore, we identified the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin as potential inhibitors of Mpro.
32455534, Rhamnetin is already commercially available in pharmacies.
32455514, Conclusion: The risk assessment of COVID-19 imported cases can be used to identify high-risk areas in recent and future, and might be helpful to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic and ultimately overcome the epidemic.
32455058, Conclusion The SpineBox represents the first open-access simulator for the instruction of spinal anatomy and pedicle screw placement.
32455058, This study aims to provide institutions across the world with an economical and feasible means of spine surgical simulation for neurosurgical trainees and to encourage other rapid prototyping laboratories to investigate innovative means of creating educational surgical platforms in the modern era.Copyright © 2020, Clifton et al.
32455057, Conclusions Knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCWs regarding the use of face masks were found to be inadequate.
32455057, Studied HCWs had a positive attitude but moderate-to-poor level of knowledge and practice regarding the use of face mask.
32455057, HCWs and general public awareness campaigns regarding the proper use of face mask by utilizing all social media available resources would be helpful during this pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Kumar et al.
32454983, Coronavirus sparks fear of medication shortage.
32454983, Coronavirus panic-buying also may have led to a shortage of critical inhalers.
32454983, We have also got elderly patients with COPD who may need Ventolin MDI and also premature babies who may have caught Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and need salbutamol MDI to support their lungs have since been compromised, and they rely heavily on Asthma inhalers.
32454983, Finding a safe and creative strategy is essential during the COVID-19 pandemic.© The Author(s) 2020.
32454982, However, several patients and health care professionals still fail to voluntarily report adverse events.
32454982, For health care providers, some barriers to reporting may include fear of negative feedback, apathy, legal concerns, and uncertainty about whether an incident qualifies as an ADR.
32454982, In the current COVID-19 Crisis, it is especially important for health care providers to be diligent about reporting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), since misinformation propagated by the media is causing patients to misuse certain medications.
32454982, We need to shift the current thought process about ADR reporting in order to encourage a positive reporting culture by patients and health care providers.© The Author(s) 2020.
32454806, South Korea employed technology and the holistic education of its physician community, despite having a smaller proportion of physicians in society, to its advantage by implementing efficacious drive-through centers that test suspected individuals rapidly and with little to no contact with healthcare staff, decreasing the possibility of transmission of COVID-19.
32454806, Conversely, Italy is presently considered the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe and has recorded the highest death toll of any country outside of mainland China.
32454806, This is partially due to the reactionary nature of Italy's public health measures compared to South Korea's proactive response.
32454806, The different healthcare responses of South Korea and Italy can inform decisions made by public health bodies in other countries, especially in countries across the Americas, which can selectively adopt policies that have worked in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and learn from mistakes made by both countries.
32454545,The German debate about the policy implications of the coronavirus becomes increasingly heated given different views on the mortality rate from SARS CoV-2, as well as the epidemiological and economic impact of lockdown measures imposed by the government.
32454545, Impact analysis applying features of randomised control trials would provide clear evidence.
32454545, However, this is currently unavailable due to a lack of an appropriate control group of countries without measures.
32454545, Thus, polarisation is likely to rise if observed mortality rates remain low.© Der/die Autor(en) 2020.
32454456, We suggest pragmatic options for screening of GDM in a pandemic setting based on blood tests, and risk calculators applied to underlying risk factors.
32454456, Alternative models for antenatal care provision for women with GDM, including targeting high-risk groups, early lifestyle interventions and remote monitoring are provided.
32454456, Testing options and their timing for postpartum screening in women who had GDM are also considered.
32454456, Our suggestions are only applicable in a pandemic scenario; usual guidelines and care pathways should be re-implemented as soon as possible and appropriate.
32454398, With fewer patients presenting to hospitals with the diagnosis of STEMI, healthcare workers are wondering what is causing this decline.

32454138, Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19.
32454138, Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation.

32452949, Standard practices allow for postponement of elective cases and deferral to nonsurgical modalities of stage II/III rectal and metastatic colorectal cancer.
32452949, Oncologically urgent cases may be delayed for 6(-12) weeks without jeopardizing oncological outcomes.
32452949, Outside established principles, administration of nonsurgical modalities is not justified and increases the vulnerability of patients.The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed already limited health care resources and forced rationing, triage and prioritization of care in general, specifically of surgical interventions.
32452949, Established guidelines allow for modifications of optimal timing and type of surgery for colorectal cancer during an unrelated pandemic.
32452947, All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide.
32452947, At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital.
32452947, The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days).This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
32452947, Our initial data suggest that VV ECMO can be successfully utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with advanced respiratory failure.
32452819, N-95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites.
32452819, Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% and 27.4% sites, respectively.
32452819, The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, were significantly disrupted (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic.Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures.
32452819, Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policymakers and health managers working at primary healthcare facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.IEC Clearance F.1/IEC/MAMC/(73/01/2020/No68).

32452701, In particular, some rapid advances using machine learning and artificial intelligence have been reported with great success.In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive update on the current state-of-the-art polypharmacology approaches and their applications, focusing on those reports published after our 2017 review article.
32452701, The authors particularly discuss some novel, groundbreaking concepts, and methods that have been developed recently and applied to drug polypharmacology studies.Polypharmacology is evolving and novel concepts are being introduced to counter the current challenges in the field.
32452701, However, major hurdles remain including incompleteness of high-quality experimental data, lack of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize multi-targeting agents, shortage of robust computational methods, and challenges to identify the best target combinations and design effective multi-targeting agents.
32452701, Fortunately, numerous national/international efforts including multi-omics and artificial intelligence initiatives as well as most recent collaborations on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic have shown significant promise to propel the field of polypharmacology forward.
32452700, Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices.
32452700, The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment.
32452700, A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection.
32452700, The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.
32452670, It was observed that there is a clear interrelated prevalence between the total number of COVID-19 cases per million population tested and the gram of spice supply per capita per day.
32452670, Nations with lower consumptions of spices per capita showed greater number of COVID-19 cases per million population.
32452670, This is not surprising as herbs and spices are well-known to boost immunity.
32452670, Although the precise molecular mechanisms associated with spices and immunity are not completely understood, our findings led us to hypothesize that spice consumption plays a role in our ability to fight COVID-19; however, intensive research is needed to determine the translational value of these findings.
32452648, We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the exponential growth to estimate the reproduction number.Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated mean SI at 5.9 days (95%CI: 3.9-9.6) and a standard deviation (SD) at 4.8 days (95%CI: 3.1-10.1).
32452648, Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen at 2.6 (95%CI: 2.4-2.8).The SI of COVID-19 is relative shorter than that of SARS and MERS, other two beta coronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission was rapid.
32452648, It is crucial to isolate close contacts promptly to control the spread of COVID-19 effectively.This article is protected by copyright.

32451846, Older adults > 65 years of age constitute a high-risk group prone to severe infection and death.
32451846, Despite the higher mortality rate, a majority of cases are expected to recover and survive from this viral outbreak.
32451846, But, the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection are unknown.
32451846, We discuss these potential chronic changes to the central nervous system (CNS) in relation to accelerated brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders.
32451808, This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment.
32451808, The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered.
32451808, Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements.
32451808, The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.
32451657, Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed.
32451657, In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a significant reduction in healthcare (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignancies of the musculoskeletal system.
32451657, Delaying or stopping these treatments is life-threatening or can cause severe morbidity, pain, and loss of function.
32451657, Although the coronavirus disease causes severe medical complications, serious collateral damage including death due to delayed or untreated sarcomas should be avoided.
32451626, Preload modifying maneuvers, such as tidal volume challenge, can also be used in COVID-19 patients, especially if the patient was in the gray zone of other dynamic tests.
32451626, However, the preload modifying maneuvers were not extensively evaluated outside the operating room.
32451626, Selection of the proper test would vary according to the level of healthcare in the country and the load of admissions which might be overwhelming.
32451626, Evaluation of the volume status should be comprehensive; therefore, the presence of signs of volume overload such as lower limb edema, lung edema, and severe hypoxemia should be considered beside the usual indices for fluid responsiveness.
32451317, Hyperglycaemia (expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose) correlates with worse outcomes in COVID-19.
32451317, It is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy.
32451317, In this article, we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy, more commonly evident in diabetes and BAME groups, makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent 'endothelitis' of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32450770, Powered air-purifying respirators and N95 masks were used mainly for procedures involving the mucosal surfaces.Due to the high viral density in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19, basic examinations and common otolaryngology procedures place practitioners at high risk of exposure.
32450770, Although there is variability in practice among otolaryngologists across North America in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, most are primarily seeing urgent ambulatory and inpatient consultations.
32450770, Most are also incorporating personal protective equipment appropriate to the level of transmission across mucous membranes.In these rapidly evolving times, it is helpful to find solidarity and assurance among health care providers.
32450770, Current data aimed to provide (1) perceived methods regarding the safe care of otolaryngology patients and (2) updated practice patterns at a national level.
32450754,Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA on nasopharyngeal swab is the standard for diagnosing active COVID-19 disease in asymptomatic cases and in symptomatic patients without the typical radiologic findings.
32450754, For the present COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, we describe 4 symptomatic patients with negative RT-PCR results at the first nasopharyngeal swab, which became positive when collected a few hours later by an otolaryngologist.
32450754, All the patients showed nasal obstruction.
32450754, The present report suggests that inadequate nasopharyngeal sampling performed by untrained operators in the presence of nasal obstruction can be a relevant case of false-negative findings at RT-PCR, with a clear negative impact on the efforts to contain the current outbreak.
32450712, Although the highest number of new cases per 1 million people in China was 9.8 on February 28, 2020; it was 108.4 on March 21, 2020, in Italy; and this was 16.6 on March 5, 2020, in South Korea.
32450712, On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey.
32450712, The log-cubic model proposed in this study has been set forth to obtain successful results for aforementioned countries, as well as to estimate the course of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32450712, Other factors such as climacteric factors and genetic differences, which may have an impact on viral spreading and transmission, would also have strengthened the model prediction capacity.
32450346, Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19.
32450346, We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents.

32450049, The normal day-to-day routines have been altered for a number of reasons, including changes to scheduled training rotations, physical distancing requirements, trainee redeployment, and heightened level of concern.
32450049, Medical educators will likely need to adapt their programs to maximize learning, maintain effective care delivery, and ensure competent graduates.
32450049, Along with a continued focus on learner/faculty wellness, medical educators will have to optimize existing training experiences, adapt those that are no longer viable, employ new technologies, and be flexible when assessing competencies.
32450049, These practical tips offer guidance on how to adapt medical education programs within the constraints of the pandemic landscape, stressing the need for communication, innovation, collaboration, flexibility, and planning within the era of competency-based medical education.
32449939, Here, based on bioinformatic analysis, I provide evidence that some members of the upper respiratory tract (URT) commensal bacteria express viral spike glycoprotein-binding proteins.
32449939, Based on this analysis and available data showing a decline in the population of these bacteria in the elderly, I propose that some URT commensal bacteria hamper SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that a decline in the population of these bacteria contributes to the severity of infection.
32449939, Further studies should provide a better understanding of the interaction of URT bacteria and SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to new therapeutic approaches.This article is protected by copyright.

32449420, Troponin levels were significantly correlated with heart rate (r = 0.387, p = .006) but not with ECG parameters.Conclusion: Several ventricular arrhythmia surface ECG predictors including QTc, QTd, and Tpe/QTc are increased in COVID-19 patients.
32449420, Since medications used in COVID-19 patients have the potential to affect these parameters, giving importance to these ECG markers may have a significant contribution in decreasing disease-related arrhythmias.
32449374, Of the 4,663 patients included, the most prevalent laboratory finding was increased C-reactive protein (CRP; 73.6%, 95% CI 65.0-81.3%), followed by decreased albumin (62.9%, 95% CI 28.3-91.2%), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (61.2%, 95% CI 41.3-81.0%), decreased eosinophils (58.4%, 95% CI 46.5-69.8%), increased interleukin-6 (53.1%, 95% CI 36.0-70.0%), lymphopenia (47.9%, 95% CI 41.6-54.9%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 46.2%, 95% CI 37.9-54.7%).
32449374, A meta-analysis of seven studies with 1905 patients showed that increased CRP (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.4), lymphopenia (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), and increased LDH (OR 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.9) were significantly associated with severity.
32449374, These results demonstrated that more attention is warranted when interpreting laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19.
32449374, Patients with elevated CRP levels, lymphopenia, or elevated LDH require proper management and, if necessary, transfer to the intensive care unit.
32449333, Apparently there is no feedback control over the antibody production.
32449333, The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype associated negative control of antibody production.
32449333, Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, knowing the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells.
32449333, The use of these two immunotherapeutic tools is understandable on the grounds of basic immunology, whose knowledge may direct the medical community in efforts to fight the virus.

32449044, One may well wonder if this massive media attention ever happened in the past and if it has been finally proven to be beneficial or even just appropriate.
32449044, Surgical site and implant-related infections represent a substantial part of health care-associated infections; with an estimated overall incidence of 6% post-surgical infection, approximately 18 million new surgical site infections are expected each year globally, with 5 to 10% mortality rate and an astounding economic and social cost.
32449044, In the current mediatic era, orthopaedic surgeons need to refocus some of their time and energies from surgery to communication and constructive research.
32449044, Only raising mediatic awareness on surgical site and implant-related infections may tune up the volume of silent epidemics to a level that can become audible by governing institutions.
32449007, To regain reliability, reshoring of the pharmaceutical supply chain to the USA is now a vital national security need.
32449007, Reshoring the pharmaceutical supply with old know-how and outdated technologies that cause inherent unpredictability and adverse environmental impact will neither provide the security we seek nor will it be competitive and affordable.
32449007, The challenge at hand is complex akin to redesigning systems, including corporate and public research and development, manufacturing, regulatory, and education ones.
32449007, The US academic community must be engaged in progressing solutions needed to counter emergencies in the COVID-19 pandemic and in building new methods to reshore the pharmaceutical supply chain beyond the pandemic.
32448759, In this review, we will explore the possible association using both recent COVID-19 studies and studies of previous pandemics.

32448377, In particular, influenza virus, coronavirus, and other respiratory viruses circulate in nature in various animal species and can cause severe and rapidly spread human infections.
32448377, Although scientific advancements have allowed for rapid progress to be made to understand the pathogenesis and develop therapeutics after each viral pandemic, few effective methods to treat virus-induced ALI have been described.
32448377, Recently, stem cell therapy has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases, including ALI.
32448377, In this review, we detail the present stem cell-based therapeutics for lung injury caused by influenza virus and the outlook for the future state of stem cell therapy to deal with emerging influenza and coronaviruses.
32448136, The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically.There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05).
32448136, In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05).
32448136, However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05).
32448136, The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group.CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.
32448124, Since March 2020, VADR has also been used to check SARS-CoV-2 sequence submissions.
32448124, Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally.VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations.
32448124, The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff.
32448124, Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.
32448034, From a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we found three ligands bound to protease during 50 ns of MD simulations.
32448034, Furthermore, the molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations showed that these chemical molecules have stable and favourable energies causing strong binding with binding site of Mpro protein.
32448034, All these three molecules, namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid, have passed the ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) property as well as Lipinski's rule of five.
32448034, The study provides a basic foundation and suggests that the three phytochemicals, viz. ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid could serve as potential inhibitors in regulating the Mpro protein's function and controlling viral replication.
32447949, Age and presence of co-morbidities correlated negatively with survival with co-efficient of -1.23 and -2.33 respectively.
32447949, Odds ratio (OR) for dying from COVID-19 for every 10-year increase in age was 3.4 compared to the previous band of 10 years.
32447949, OR for dying of COVID-19 was 10.3 for the presence of any of the co-morbidities.
32447949, Our findings could help in triaging the patients in the emergency room and emphasize the need to protect the elderly and those with comorbidities from getting exposed.
32447630, No part of the neuraxis is spared.
32447630, The neurological disorders occurring with COVID-19 may have many pathophysiological underpinnings.
32447630, Some appear to be the consequence of direct viral invasion of the nervous system tissue, others arise as a postviral autoimmune process, and still others are the result of metabolic and systemic complications due to the associated critical illness.
32447630, This review addresses the preliminary observations regarding the neurological disorders reported with COVID-19 to date and describes some of the disorders that are anticipated from prior experience with similar coronaviruses.
32447523, Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies.
32447523, For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them.
32447523, The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development.
32447523, This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches.

32446559, With the Fate-seq approach, we detected multiple virus-derived RNA sequences that stabilized GFP reporter RNA, including sequences derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
32446559, Comparative genomic analysis revealed that these RNA sequences and their predicted secondary structures are highly conserved between SARS-CoV and the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the global outbreak of the coronavirus-associated disease that emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19).

32446037, To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs.
32446037, The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others.The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario.As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes.
32446037, We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32445496, Psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal responses to the coronavirus were assessed in the March survey.Pre-pandemic experiences with weight discrimination were associated with greater concerns about the virus, engaging in more preventative behaviors, less trust in people and institutions to manage the outbreak, and greater perceived declines in connection to one's community.
32445496, BMI tended to be unrelated to these responses.Despite the risks of complications of COVID-19 associated with obesity, individuals with higher BMI were neither more concerned about the virus nor taking more behavioral precautions than individuals in other weight categories.
32445496, Weight discrimination, in contrast, may heighten vigilance to threat, which may have contributed to both positive (greater concern, more precautionary behavior) and negative (less trust, declines community connection) responses to the pandemic.This article is protected by copyright.

32445330, Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission.
32445330, Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.
32445330, The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges.
32445330, However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.
32445287,Integrating risk communication and community engagement into the national public health emergency response is crucial.
32445287, Considering the difficulties and challenges faced by China in the prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and based on interim guidelines from the World Health Organization, this article makes several recommendations addressing the outbreak in China.
32445287, These include improvements in the internal governmental risk communication systems, enhancing the coordination between internal and partner governmental emergency management, and promoting public communication in response to societal concerns.
32445287, Regarding these recommendations, we emphasize community engagement in joint prevention and control, confronting uncertainty and countering rumors effectively, and strengthening international cooperation and evidence-based decision making for prevention and control measures.© 2020 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.
32444481, We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%-50%).Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%-6.4%).
32444481, After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%-3.1%).
32444481, The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%-6.9%).
32444481, With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%-3.6%).Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%. The CFR estimates for the US were higher than those for Canada, but the adjusted CFR still remained below 2%.

32443911, The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes.
32443911, In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs).
32443911, In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs.
32443911, Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.
32443640, We focused on the application of a stochastic approach in fitting the model parameters using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solver, to improve the reliability of predictions in the medium term (30 days).

32443640, We linked the model equations to the changes in people's mobility, with reference to Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports.
32443640, We discussed the effectiveness of policies taken by different regions and countries and how they have an impact on past and future infection scenarios.
32443022, In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk.
32443022, To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures).
32443022, This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide.

32442131, However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-square tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-square test.We reanalyze the data from the city of Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.We excluded the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopted a more appropriate statistical method, including the permutation test and the Fisher exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo.After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, the Fisher exact test yields a P value of .84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis.
32442131, The odds ratio of the coronavirus transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval 0.5-2.8.Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we concluded that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.©Guosheng Yin, Huaqing Jin.

32441586, Given the increased risk for severe COVID-19 observed in adults with underlying cardiac involvement, there is concern that patients with pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) may likewise be at increased risk for severe infection.
32441586, The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 include myocarditis, arrhythmia and myocardial infarction.
32441586, Importantly, the pandemic has stretched health care systems and many care team members are at risk for contracting and possibly transmitting the disease which may further impact the care of patients with cardiovascular disease.
32441586, In this review, we describe the effects of COVID-19 in the pediatric and young adult population and review the cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 focusing on implications for patients with congenital heart disease in particular.
32441573, Increasing the federal share of Medicaid spending as unemployment rises would mitigate fiscal pressure on states and preserve public services.
32441573, But unlike the demand for Medicaid's health care protections, which rises when economic activity declines, the demand for long-term care protections will grow even in a healthy economy as the population ages.
32441573, Enhanced federal support is urgent not only to cope with the virus today but also to meet the long-term care needs of the nation's aging population in the years to come.
32441573, Long-term care financing policy should be modified to either adjust federal matching funds by the age of each state's population, or fully federalize the funding of LTC expenses of Medicaid beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicare.
32441351,Tracheotomy, through its ability to wean patients off ventilation, can shorten ICU length of stay and in doing so increase ICU bed capacity, crucial for saving lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32441351, To date, there is a paucity of patient selection criteria and prognosticators to facilitate decision making and enhance precious ICU capacity.Prospective study of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy (n = 12) over a 4-week period (March-April 2020).
32441351, Association between preoperative and postoperative ventilation requirements and outcomes (ICU stay, time to decannulation, and death) were examined.Patients who sustained FiO2  ≤ 50% and PEEP ≤ 8 cm H2 O in the 24 hours pretracheotomy exhibited a favorable outcome.
32441351, Those whose requirements remained below these thresholds post-tracheotomy could be safely stepped down after 48 hours.Sustained FiO2  ≤ 50% and PEEP ≤ 8 cm H2 O in the 48 hours post-tracheotomy are strong predictive factors for a good outcome, raising the potential for these patients to be stepped down early, thus increasing ICU capacity.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32440918, Consequently, the age-LDH-CD4 algorithm was derived as (age × LDH)/CD4 count.
32440918, In the training set, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively).
32440918, In the prospective validation set, the AUROC of age-LDH-CD4 model was also significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.75, 0.81, and 0.82, respectively).
32440918, The age-LDH-CD4 ≥ 82 has high sensitive (81%) and specific (93%) for the early identification of COVID-19 patients with severe progression tendency.The age-LDH-CD4 model is a simple algorithm for early identifying patients with severe progression tendency following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and warrants further validation.

32438934, The results also suggest that the nature of the COVID-19 impact (except for the loss of a loved one) may not be as relevant for the older adults' well-being as their appraisals and personal resources for managing COVID-related problems.
32438934, In addition, these results suggest that some sociodemographic and health-related variables have an impact on older adults' well-being.
32438934, Thus, perceived-health, family functioning, resilience, gratitude and acceptance had significant associations with both personal growth and purpose in life.
32438934, Efforts to address older adults' psychological well-being focusing on older adults' personal resources should be considered.

32438617, The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction.
32438617, In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors.
32438617, CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources.
32438617, Although the data come from a very small cohort, our protocol seems related to a low mortality.
32438520,Previous research has identified a relationship between climate and occurrence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, information that can be used to reduce the risk of infection.
32438520, Using COVID-19 notification and postcode data from New South Wales, Australia during the exponential phase of the epidemic in 2020, we used time-series analysis to investigate the relationship between 749 cases of locally-acquired COVID-19 and daily rainfall, 9am and 3pm temperature, and 9am and 3pm relative humidity.
32438520, Lower 9am relative humidity (but not rainfall or temperature) was associated with increased case occurrence; a reduction in relative humidity of 1% was predicted to be associated with an increase of COVID-19 cases by 6.11%. During periods of low relative humidity, the public health system should anticipate an increased number of COVID-19 cases.This article is protected by copyright.

32438383, The virus gains access to the respiratory epithelium through cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32438383, The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus is unlikely to mutate without loss of pathogenicity and thus represents an attractive target for antiviral treatment.
32438383, Inhaled modified recombinant human ACE2, may bind SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate lung damage.
32438383, This decoy strategy is unlikely to provoke an adverse immune response and may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups.
32438382,The COVID-19 pandemic requires us to rethink how virtual approaches might work for people who use alcohol and other drugs.
32438382, Are virtual clinics only suitable for clients with whom clinicians have already formed a therapeutic relationship? How well would virtual clinics work for new clients presenting to services, for clients in acute distress, and for those with complex problems? Addressing the sustained change required to maintain substance-free lives or a safe substance-use life requires robust psychotherapeutic approaches, which have traditionally been delivered through physical contact, whether they are one-to-one or group-based interventions.
32438382, The challenge during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic is to deliver effective talking therapies while avoiding physical contact.
32438382, How then should services continue to offer counselling and support in such an environment? How can we learn from the COVID-19 situation to deliver treatment to individuals who may have difficulties attending traditional clinic-based care, such as those in more rural areas with transport difficulties? This article focuses on identifying practical issues and providing some solutions.
32438329, Virtual Reality (VR) also offers an imperative role for fighting this pandemic, through audiovisual-based virtual communication.A brief study on Virtual Reality and its applications for the COVID-19 pandemic is carried out by employing keywords as Virtual reality or VR and COVID-19 from the databases of SCOPUS, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of science Academia and ResearchGate.VR is beneficial for remote sites for exploring telemedicine, planning, treatment, and controlling of the infections by providing proper awareness to the people regarding this disease.VR technology develops a platform to reduce the face to face interaction of doctors with the infected COVID-19 patients.

32437434, This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia.
32437434, The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.
32437381, In total 154 responses (82 completed, 72 partially completed) were analysed in the context of the COVID-19 dissemination.72.4% of the respondent's state that their processes are affected due to COVID-19, while the top three answers are longer processing times (54.2%), patient no-shows (42.5%) and staff reduction (36.7%). 75.8% expect further unavailability of their personnel in the upcoming weeks.
32437381, All participants have already taken several measures, especially providing information for patients at the entrance (89.6%) or over the phone (73.6%), restricting access for accompanying persons (77.4%) and providing disinfectant at the entrance (72.6%).The results presented in this article aim to support business continuity and risk management for radiotherapy centres to prepare for future challenges.
32437381, The results show that most radiotherapy centres has implemented initial contingency measures, applying them pragmatically.
32437381, The main problem however remains, that is the high risk of infection both for patients and medical personnel along with the associated risk of temporarily loss of personnel and ordered closure of business.
32437377, We analyzed several variables to test this hypothesis, such as the percentage of infected patients aged >80 years, available nursing home beds, COVID-19 incidence rate, and the number of days from when the number of positive tests exceeded 50 (epidemic maturity).
32437377, We also included in the analysis mean household size and percentage of households comprising one person, in the region.
32437377, Paradoxically, the results are opposite of what was previously reported.
32437377, The pandemic was more severe in regions with higher family fragmentation and increased availability of residential health facilities.
32437329, In absolute terms, approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation were performed over just 34 days.
32437329, States severely affected by COVID-19 appear to have some of the greatest increases in the number of searches.Our results corroborate media reports that gun purchases are increasing amid the COVID-19 pandemic and provide more precise geographic and temporal trends.

32434602, At their core, these challenges are the same: how to beat Covid-19.
32434602, Certainly, there are differences in how individual systems are organized and how they address the main issues arising from the pandemic while not forgetting the ongoing healthcare needs of the general population.
32434602, In this paper, we share some perspectives from Croatia regarding Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHs) in these extraordinary circumstances.
32434602, We give our personal insight on deficiencies in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services prior to the arrival of Covid-19, which have contributed to difficulties in mitigating and managing the ongoing crisis.
32434092, Being under a stay-at-home order was associated with greater health anxiety, financial worry, and loneliness.

32433782, In this paper we provide a summary of how utilitarianism could inform two challenging questions that have been important in the early phase of the pandemic: Triage: which patients should receive access to a ventilator if there is overwhelming demand outstripping supply? Lockdown: How should countries decide when to implement stringent social restrictions, balancing preventing deaths from COVID-19 with causing deaths and reducing in wellbeing from other causes? Our aim is not to argue that utilitarianism is the only relevant ethical theory, or in favour of a purely utilitarian approach.
32433782, However, clearly considering which options will do the most good overall will help societies identify and consider the necessary cost of other values.
32433782, Societies may choose either to embrace or not to embrace the utilitarian course, but with a clear understanding of the values involved and the price they are willing to pay.This article is protected by copyright.

32433365,: The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to worsen mental health problems in the general population, including increasing engagement in addictive behaviors.
32433365, Here, we describe observations suggesting that the current crisis and its sequelae may worsen problem gambling.
32433365, The current pandemic may impact financial and psychological well-being due to social isolation during spatial distancing, and these stressors in conjunction with substantial changes in gambling markets (land-based, online) during the pandemic may significantly influence gambling behaviors.
32433365, This situation calls for rapid research initiatives in this area and preventive and regulatory measures by multiple stakeholders.
32433248, The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care.
32433248, The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics.
32433248, Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount.
32433248, Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.
32432994, There was a 21% significant decrease (0.79; [95%CI, 0.76-0.82]; P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin puncture, overall (mean 144.9±SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.2±70.9; P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6±SD 82.0 minutes versus 153.25±67; P<0.001).
32432994, After the instatement of strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the number of MT cases (R2 -0.51; P=0.04).
32432994, Patients treated during the COVID outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to have unwitnessed strokes (both P<0.05).Our study showed a significant decrease in patients treated with MTs during the first stages of the COVID epidemic in France and alarming indicators of lengthened care delays.
32432994, These findings prompt immediate consideration of local and regional stroke networks preparedness in the varying contexts of COVID-19 pandemic evolution.
32432804, These are continuing problems as coronavirus epidemics may recur with future impact on blood collection and blood donation screening.

32432785, Despite the number of cases increasing exponentially in most of the countries, there exist certain disparities in terms of case-fatality rates.
32432785, As of April 24, 2020, the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is about 7.0%, with 193,671 deaths and 2,761,121 confirmed cases around the world.
32432785, Although the United States of America (USA), Spain, Italy, France, and Germany are the top-most affected counties in terms of confirmed cases; France, Italy and Spain are leading the list in terms of case-fatality rates.
32432785, Therefore, through this mini-review, authors sought to brief on possible assumptions (five D's) that might contribute to the varying case-fatality rates among different countries across the globe.
32432568, Our hospital footprint for Obstetrics was dramatically reduced to make room for the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, and established guidelines were quickly modified to reduce potential staff and patient exposures.
32432568, New communication strategies were developed to facilitate maternity care across our hospitals, with significantly limited resources in personnel, equipment, and space.
32432568, The lessons learned from these unexpected challenges offered an opportunity to reassess the delivery of obstetrical care without compromising quality and safety.
32432568, These lessons may well prove valuable after the peak of the crisis has passed.
32432563, However, potentially under-recognized by those reporting on D-dimer is the considerable variation in reporting units for D-dimer, and thus also the potential for misreporting of D-dimer data based on poor or incomplete reporting.
32432563, A PubMed search was used to identify recent papers reporting on D-dimers in COVID-19-based studies.
32432563, We report that: (1) most publications did not identify either the manufacturer or D-dimer product used; (2) most did not identify whether D-dimer values were reported as D-dimer units (DDU) or fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (~2 ×  differences); (3) nearly half did not identify normal cut-off values; (4) some did not report numerical findings or units for D-dimer; (5) where reported, most identified units as either mg/L or μg/mL; (6) we identified at least four errors in reporting from 21 papers.
32432563, It may not be possible to truly standardize D-dimer assays, but it should be feasible to harmonize D-dimer assays to a single unit of measurement.
32432461, We first developed a flexible nanoporous Si-based template on a silicon-on-insulator wafer using KOH etching and then used the template as a hard mask during a reactive ion etching process to transfer the patterns onto a flexible and lightweight (<0.12 g) polymeric membrane.
32432461, Pores with sizes down to 5 nm were achieved with a narrow distribution.
32432461, Theoretical calculations show that airflow rates above 85 L/min are possible through the mask, which confirms its breathability over a wide range of pore sizes, densities, membrane thicknesses, and pressure drops.
32432461, Finally, the membrane is intrinsically hydrophobic, which contributes to antifouling and self-cleaning as a result of droplets rolling and sliding on the inclined mask area.
32432219,Globally, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening human health and changing the way people live.
32432219, With the increasing evidence showing comorbidities of COVID-19 and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the Pacific region, where approximately 75% of deaths are due to NCDs, is significantly vulnerable during this crisis unless urgent action is taken.
32432219, Whilst enforcing the critical mitigation measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific, it is also paramount to incorporate and strengthen NCD prevention and control measures to safeguard people with NCDs and the general population; keep people healthy and minimise the impact of COVID-19.
32432219, To sustain wellbeing of health, social relationships, and the economy in the Pacific, it is a critical time for all governments, development partners and civil societies to show regional solidarity in the fight against emerging COVID-19 health crisis and existing Pacific NCDs crisis through a whole of government and whole of society approach.©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).
32431961, We present a simple and yet practical epidemiological tool, the Pandemic Efficiency Index (PEI), that can be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from COVID-19 infection.
32431961, Using the PEI and current COVID-19-related mortality, we determined that so far Germany demonstrates the highest PEI (5.1) among countries with more than 5,000 recorded cases of the infection, indicating high quality measures instituted by the country to avert death during the pandemic.
32431961, Italy and France currently have the lowest COVID-19-related PEIs.
32431961, Epidemics and pandemics come and go, but local, national, and global abilities to determine the efficiency of their efforts in averting deaths is critical.Copyright © 2020 Salihu et al.
32431949, We found that the bat RaTG13 virus best matched the overall codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 in orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, while the pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage in membrane gene.
32431949, The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs.
32431949, However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.© The Author(s) 2020.

32431756, The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source.The new "Corona Curtain" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32431756, The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units.
32431756, Future validation studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the intubation tents by quantifying the pre-/post-intubation exposure through "point-of-care" SARS-CoV-2 testing once these resources are more widely available.© The Author(s) 2020.
32431289,Data from the rapid mortality surveillance system in 19 major Italian cities were used to carry out a timely assessment of the health impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.
32431289, By 18 April, a + 45% excess in mortality was observed, with a higher impact in the north of the country (+ 76%).
32431289, The excess was greatest among men, with an increasing trend by age.
32431289, Surveillance data can be used to evaluate the lockdown and re-opening phases.
32431287, Public health policies aimed at preventing new COVID-19 cases were very effective in halting the pandemic in Thailand.
32431287, Case fatality in Thailand has been low (1.7%), at least in part due to early stratification according to risk of disease severity and timely initiation of supportive care with affordable measures.
32431287, We present our initial experience with COVID-19 in Thailand, focusing on several aspects that may have played a crucial role in curtailment of the pandemic, and elements of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients, including stratification, isolation, and affordable diagnostic approaches and supportive care measures.
32431287, We also discuss local considerations concerning some proposed experimental treatments.
32431273, Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries.
32431273, Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to "unlock" or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. "Precision physical distancing"-distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings-is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19.
32431273, It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures.
32431273, Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.

32431003, According to the Trines (2018), the global immigrant population of nurses is 15.2% in the UK, 23.3% in Australia, 26.7% in New Zealand, 18.7% in Switzerland, and 7.7% in Canada.
32431003, Patel et al., (2018) determined that 1.3% to 23.1% registered nurses, nurse practitioners, licensed practice nurses, and nursing aids in the US are immigrants (non-US born and non- US citizens).
32431003, Possibly, the actual number of immigrant nurses in the developed countries cannot be estimated accurately because many of these nurses have not obtained the practicing license and are working as personal care attendants, home, and developmental support workers.This article is protected by copyright.

32430094, Four human coronaviruses circulate seasonally and cause common colds.
32430094, Two other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, have crossed from animal sources into humans but have not become endemic.
32430094, Here we review what is known about the human humoral immune response to epidemic SARS CoV and MERS CoV and to the seasonal, endemic coronaviruses.
32430094, Then we summarize recent, mostly non-peer reviewed, studies into SARS-CoV-2 serology and reinfection in humans and non-human primates and summarize current pressing research needs.
32429920, A Call to Action: The flexibility and adaptability of mobile clinics make them ideal partners in responding to pandemics, such as COVID-19.
32429920, In this commentary we propose three approaches to support further expansion and integration of mobile health clinics into the healthcare system: First, demonstrate the economic contribution of mobile clinics to the healthcare system.
32429920, Second, expand the number of mobile clinic programs and integrate them into the healthcare infrastructure and emergency preparedness.
32429920, Third, expand their use of technology to facilitate this integration.Understanding the economic and social impact that mobile clinics are having in our communities should provide the evidence to justify policies that will enable expansion and optimal integration of mobile clinics into our healthcare delivery system, and help us address current and future health crises.
32429722, On sensitivity analyses, we found that with increasing gestational age, the probability which antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy decreased.Conclusion: Administration of antenatal corticosteroids was an effective management strategy compared to no corticosteroid administration at gestational ages less than 31 weeks.
32429722, These results provide data for clinicians to utilize when counseling pregnant patients hospitalized with PPROM and have a COVID-19 infection.
32429679, Successively, the virus spreads into various regions nationwide and has currently become an epidemic.
32429679, The WHO has warned Pakistan that the country could encounter great challenge against the outbreak of coronavirus in the coming days.
32429679, This short communication is conducted to shed light on the epidemic of coronavirus in the country.
32429679, It would aid in emphasizing the up-to-date situation in a nutshell and the measures taken by the health sector of Pakistan to abate the risk of communication.
32429450, A transmission dynamics model fitted to the cumulative case time series data permits us to estimate the effectiveness of interventions implemented in terms of the contact rate, probability of transmission per contact, proportion of isolated contacts, and detection rate.
32429450, This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one).
32429450, From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound.
32429450, From this, we quantify the conditions needed to prevent epidemic rebound during de-escalation by simply reversing the escalation process.
32428385, The first two authors produced a draft, based on analysis of the current government guidance and the application of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework to identify and evaluate the options.For promoting social distancing, 10 options were identified for improving adherence.
32428385, They covered improvements in ways of achieving the BCW intervention types of education, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion.
32428385, For promoting shielding of vulnerable people, four options were identified covering the BCW intervention types of incentivization, coercion, and enablement.Responding to policymakers very rapidly as has been necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by using a framework to structure the thinking and reporting of multidisciplinary academics and policymakers.© 2020 The Authors.

32428245, This has included doubling or trebling intensive care (ICU) capacity within hospitals, augmenting this with Nightingale Hospitals, cancelling all non-emergency surgery and redeploying staff and equipment to focus on a single disease.
32428245, At the same time, government and population efforts have - through social distancing then lockdown- successfully flattened the epidemic curve and so reduced demand.
32428245, Together, these actions have enabled treatment of all those needing hospital care for COVID-19 and avoided the unfettered increase in mortality that would have accompanied an overwhelmed healthcare service.This article is protected by copyright.

32428031, The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%).
32428031, Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases).
32428031, Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals).Work-related transmission is considerable in early COVID-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW.
32428031, Implementing preventive/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.
32427651, A common but nonspecific pattern of disease with a somewhat predictable progression is seen in patients with COVID-19.
32427651, Specifically, patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of the lower lungs may be present initially, eventually undergoing coalescence, consolidation, and organization, and ultimately showing features of fibrosis.
32427651, In this article, we review the computed tomography features of COVID-19 infection.
32427651, Familiarity with these findings and their evolution will help radiologists recognize potential COVID-19 and recognize the significant overlap with other causes of acute lung injury.

32427227, With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s.
32427227, Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered.

32427170, COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types).
32427170, A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards.
32427170, Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

32427104, A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for NC and 0.43 for the Charlotte region.
32427104, Also, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model emerged as the model with better fit.Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention.
32427104, Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level.
32427104, Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.
32426896,Given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many patients with haemophilia will have close contact with a confirmed case or suffer from coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID-19) and will need medical attention.

32426855,On December 31, 2019, from the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, comes the first case of "atypical ARDS/ interstitial pneumonia". On February 11, 2020 the WHO officially announced the name of the emergent disease associated with new coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2): COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) (1).
32426855, On February 13, 72000 cases have been officially recorded in China, among which 15000 were registered in Hubei province only, with 242 deaths in a single day.

32426202,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may remain viable in the air for up to three hours, placing health care workers in close proximity to aerosolizing procedures particularly at high risk for infection.
32426202, This combined with the drastic shortage of negative pressure rooms hospitals worldwide has led to the rapid innovation of novel biohazard isolation hoods, which can be adapted to create negative pressure isolation environments around the patient's airway using the hospital wall suction, which carries many limitations, including weaker suction capabilities, single patient use, and immobility.
32426202, Here, we report our Vacuum Assisted Negative Pressure Isolation Hood (VANISH) system that uses a mobile and readily available in most hospital operating rooms Stryker Neptune™ (Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan) high-powered suction system to more effectively create a negative pressure biohazard isolation environment.

32425880,COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic emergency, distressing health systems in each affected country.
32425880, COVID-19 determines the need for healthcare in a large number of people in an extremely short time and, like a tsunami wave, overruns emergency, infectious diseases, and pneumology departments as well as intensive care units, choking healthcare services.
32425880, Rehabilitation services are also affected by this epidemic which forces radical changes both in the organization and in the operating methods.
32425880, In the absence of reference literature on this issue, this report aims to provide a background documentation to support physicians and healthcare personnel involved in neurorehabilitation and rehabilitation care.Copyright © 2020 Bartolo, Intiso, Lentino, Sandrini, Paolucci, Zampolini and the Board of the Italian Society of Neurological Rehabilitation (SIRN).
32425701, In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels.
32425701, Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment.
32425701, Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32425701, Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.
32425662, Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications.
32425662, The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI.

32425643,Studies reported associations of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19, but conclusions were inconsistent.
32425643, We aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with severity of COVID-19.We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database until March 20, 2020.
32425643, Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models.A total of 16 studies comprising of 3962 patients with COVID-19 were included in our analysis.
32425643, Random-effect results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in nonsevere group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = -0.13 ng/ml, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = -21.32 ng/l, 95% CI = [-28.34, -14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = -8 mm/h, 95% CI = [-14, -2], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = -43.35 μg/ml, 95% CI = [-80.85, -5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = -398.80 mg/l, 95% CI = [-625.89, -171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in severe group.
32425643, Moreover, survivors had a lower level for IL-6 than non-survivors (WMD = -4.80 ng/ml, 95% CI = [-5.87, -3.73], P < 0.001).
32425643, These results were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment.The meta-analysis highlights the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19.

32425475, This included 288 separate patients, including 136 males and 119 females (gender missing=33), with a median age of 62.0 years (IQR=43.5-74.9).
32425475, The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision-makers in understanding the system's performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand.
32425475, With increased COVID-19 related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available.
32425475, The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands.Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19 related demand for RFDS services, modelling demonstrates that robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Air Medical Journal Associates.

32425321,Much of the focus regarding the global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic complications.
32425321, However, neurologic complications have arisen as an increasingly recognized area of morbidity and mortality.This brief report summarizes the neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician.COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide.
32425321, While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
32425321, Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications.When caring for COVID-19 patients, emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the neurologic complications from COVID-19.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32425281, In response to the pandemic, many countries have had to introduce drastic legally mandated lockdowns to enforce physical separation, which are ravaging economies worldwide.
32425281, Although it will be many months or even years before the final verdict can be reached, we believe that it is already possible to identify 12 key lessons that we can learn from to reduce the tremendous economic and social costs of this pandemic and which can inform responses to future crises.
32425281, These include lessons around the importance of transparency, solidarity, coordination, decisiveness, clarity, accountability and more.© 2020 The Author(s).

32425276, When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear.
32425276, Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19.
32425276, The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression.
32425276, These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.
32425270, BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice.
32425270, Additionally, the 3.8Å Cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibody's epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site.
32425270, Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies.
32425270, Altogether, we showed that human neutralizing antibodies could be efficiently discovered by high-throughput single B-cell sequencing in response to pandemic infectious diseases.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32425251, This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.
32425251, The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.
32425251, At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32425246, This may lead to pharmacokinetic changes that impact psychotropic medications and increase sensitivity to psychotropic-related adverse effects.
32425246, Additionally, several proposed treatments for COVID-19 have neuropsychiatric effects and potential interactions with commonly used psychotropics.Clinicians should be aware of the need to adjust existing psychotropics or avoid using certain medications in some COVID-19 patients.
32425246, They should also be familiar with neuropsychiatric effects of medications being used to treat this disease.

32425200, The rise of COVID-19 prompted us to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway.
32425200, In this paper, we outline our experience rapidly transitioning prenatal care to a new model with 4 in-person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan).
32425200, We then explore how lessons from this implementation can inform patient-centered prenatal care redesign during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32425197, Sinai (New York City) EMR health system data, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 8438 COVID-19 patients seen between March 1st and April 22nd 2020.
32425197, Risk of intubation and of death rose as a function of increasing age and as a function of greater cardiovascular comorbidity.
32425197, Combining age and specific comorbidity markers showed patterns suggesting that cardiovascular comorbidities increased relative risks for adverse outcomes most substantially in the younger subjects with progressively diminishing relative effects at older ages.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32425182,Lifestyle is a cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention and the process of risk communication constitutes an important step to obtain favorable changes in daily habits.
32425182, Nevertheless, there is no definite consensus on how health operators should provide information on cardiovascular risk, and several models have been proposed in different settings.
32425182, The current COVID-19 pandemic - with related communication strategies to reduce the spread of the disease and morbidity - may offer an interesting opportunity to reconsider communication in cardiovascular prevention: even though cardiovascular conditions are not communicable diseases, both COVID-19 and cardiac illnesses force a huge segment of the population to major lifestyle changes.
32425182, This narrative commentary describes similarities between these conditions, mainly focusing on modalities of risk communication, strategies to counteract fake news, actions to enhance the expertise of health operators, and finally on new skills that could derive as a lesson from COVID-19.
32425001, The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions.
32425001, Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission.
32425001, Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice.
32425001, In addition to the standard precautions, some special precautions that should be implemented during an outbreak have been raised in this review.

32424489, It is a priority to produce data both rapidly and accurately in order to identify current therapies that can be repurposed to offer protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32424489, As healthcare workers are both at high risk for infection and able to be readily diagnosed, they offer a potential wealth of data to be analyzed.
32424489, A systematic data analysis of exposure and infection rates among healthcare workers could yield patterns identifying common protective factors, such as medications with prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2, that can be fast-tracked into available therapies.
32424489, With results suggesting their activity against other coronaviruses and their widespread adoption, Antiretroviral cocktails could be a promising initial target for such large-scale data analysis approach.
32424085, Using data from a prospective study of young, low-income mothers who survived Hurricane Katrina, we find that bereavement, fearing for loved ones' well-being, and lacking access to medical care and medications predict adverse mental and physical health 1 y postdisaster, and some effects persist 12 y later.
32424085, Adjusting for preexisting health and socioeconomic conditions attenuates, but does not eliminate, these associations.
32424085, The findings, while drawn from a demographically unique sample, suggest that, to mitigate the indirect effects of COVID-19, lapses in medical care and medication use must be minimized, and public health resources should be directed to those with preexisting medical conditions, their social networks, and the bereaved.Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

32423338, Smoke was passed through the cadaver head, and images were taken with a high-resolution camera in a standardized manner.
32423338, Digital image processing was used to calculate relative amounts of small-particle escape from a variety of masks, including a standard surgical mask, a modified Ambu mask, and our negative airway pressure respirator (NAPR).Significant amounts of aerosolized particles escaped during the trials with no mask, a standard surgical mask, and the NAPR without suction.
32423338, When suction was applied to the NAPR, creating a negative-pressure system, no particle escape was noted.We present a new and effective method for the study of small-particle aerosols as a step toward better understanding the spread of these particles and the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019.
32423338, We also present the concept of an NAPR to better protect health care workers from aerosols generated from the upper and lower airways.
32423323, The COVID-19 pandemic, with its massive disruption in social interaction by way of "stay at home" orders, is serving as a catalyst for improving telehealth.
32423323, Large health systems are investing millions of dollars and increasing telehealth visit numbers 100-fold to access patients.
32423323, The "telehealth movement" is here to stay and will undoubtedly be incorporated into providers' daily lives years after the COVID-19 pandemic.
32423323, By embracing virtual access to health care, otolaryngologists will be able to influence improvements to these systems and broaden access options for patient care well into the future.
32423291,With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many novel presentations of known conditions are occurring.
32423291, In the pediatric population, new instances of Kawasaki disease have recently been singled out as presenting in conjunction with or soon after diagnosis of COVID-19.
32423291, This poses a novel situation, particularly for otolaryngologists, who may be the first to encounter these patients.
32423291, Otolaryngologists should be cognizant of the coexistence of conditions to allow for timely recognition and optimal management.
32423283, Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, <1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, <1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, <1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter.
32423283, The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm).Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from routine rhinologic procedures.
32423283, The droplet generation from drilling was mitigated with the use of concurrent suction.
32423283, Extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, which was found to cause droplet contamination.
32423150, Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time.
32423150, This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics.
32423150, To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time.
32423150, Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.
32423094, Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.
32423094, Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17).
32423094, Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death.
32423094, Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32422948, In the 13 districts in Wuhan, the spatial regression analysis was applied.
32422948, The results showed that: 1) increasing population density, construction land area proportion, value-added of tertiary industry per unit of land area, total retail sales of consumer goods per unit of land area, public green space density, aged population density were associated with an increased COVID-19 morbidity rate due to the positive characteristics of estimated coefficients of these variables. 2) increasing average building scale, GDP per unit of land area, and hospital density were associated with a decreased COVID-19 morbidity rate due to the negative characteristics of estimated coefficients of these variables.
32422948, It was concluded that it is possible to control infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, by adjusting social and economic factors.
32422948, We should guide urban development to improve human health.
32422932, It was detected at five out of six sampling time points across the course of 18 months.
32422932, A partial segment 1 from an ancestral Pteropine orthoreovirus, p10, makes up the recombinant portion of the virus, which shares high similarity with previously reported RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 strains that were detected in Yúnnan, China.
32422932, RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 is an intriguing, cross-family recombinant virus, with a geographical range that expands farther than was previously known.
32422932, The discovery of RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 in Singapore indicates that this recombinant coronavirus exists in a broad geographical range, and can persist in bat colonies long-term.
32422645, One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain.
32422645, Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment.
32422645, Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants.
32422645, These results pave the way for using S309- and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.
32422482, Further, the results show the U-shaped relationship between economic growth and poverty headcounts, as economic growth first decreases and later increase poverty headcount due to rising healthcare disparities among nations.
32422482, The causality estimates show that lack of access to basic amenities lead to increase of communicable diseases including COVID-19 whereas chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel emissions continue to increase healthcare expenditures and economic growth in a panel of selected countries.

32422331, In a few hospitals, existing neurosurgical and medical intensive care units have been converted to isolation intensive care units.
32422331, A separate roster of doctors, nurses, and allied staff has been drafted to care for these patients to avoid contamination and allow effective quarantine of the staff involved in care.At the directive of the government, all neurosurgical centers postponed routine cases and some have closed their outpatient departments because of the lack of protective gear.
32422331, All neurosurgical centers have seen drastic reductions in cases.In these challenging times, we neurosurgeons, who are naturally primed and trained to respond and take on challenges in difficult situations, have the ideal opportunity to shine and make a true difference during this pandemic and beyond and be "5-star doctors."Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32422180, In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.
32422180, We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.
32422180, By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32419926, The performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.
32419926, Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well.
32419926, Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection.
32419926, Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.Copyright: © 2020 Veljkovic V et al.
32421390, The greatest challenge with the medium is the loss of the ability to read and display nonverbal cues.
32421390, Vigilant attention to proven communication strategies and solicitation of patient involvement with the discussion can allow the care provider to display empathy at a distance.
32421390, Having serious discussions through telemedicine is likely unavoidable for many providers in this unprecedented time.
32421390, This summary provides some strategies to help to maintain the high standard of care that we all seek for our patients who are receiving serious news.
32421355, At logistic regression, only the presence of PA during quarantine significantly predicted a TIR >70%. Conclusions: Glycemic control of T1DM in adolescents using HCL system did not worsen during the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemics and further improved in those who continued PA during the quarantine.
32421355, Maintaining regular PA in a safe home environment is an essential strategy for young individuals with T1DM during the COVID-19 crisis.
32421292, Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity.
32421292, Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population.
32421292, Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year.
32421292, Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.
32421214, This framework of phased interventions and resources is intended to assist health systems and programs impacted by the pandemic to plan for how to address current mental health issues arising as well as to prepare and plan for the continued needs of their communities, patients, and staff.

32420932, Authors have noticed an elevated number of deaths within 21 days after surgery.
32420932, Piacenza: 4 cases in 2019 (4.4%) and 11 in 2020 (18.0%), of which 9 cases CoVID positive.
32420932, In Parma in 2019 two deaths were encountered; in 2020 6 patients died and 5 cases were CoVID positive.In the first two months of the Italian epidemic, in the cities of Piacenza and Parma over 80% of deaths have occurred in patients over 70 years old.
32420932, Even if preliminary, our study shows a significant increase in death in elderly patients surgically treated for proximal femur fractures, particularly in the Piacenza Hospital.
32420927,The global context we are experiencing, characterized by the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, imposes strict containment, isolation and physical distance measures, necessary to control and contain the risk of contagion.
32420927, Despite social distances and isolation in this context of threat to Global Health, the sharing of experiences, professionalism, scientific research and Public Health strategies is fundamental.
32420927, Never before has telemedicine played a decisive role in supporting the healthcare organization, The University Hospital Consortium Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental partnership project with West China Hospital of Sichuan University through periodic and scheduled video conferences.The Company Strategic Management, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bari, Medical Executives of the Health Department, of the U.O of Infectious Diseases, Anesthesia and Resuscitation, Pulmonology, Emergency, Hygiene, Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Doctors Resident operating in the COVID Area. are involved in the Experimental Project., all adequately trained and instructed on the operating protocol.From the preliminary data of this study, it appears that the Bari Polyclinic has adopted the same therapeutic strategies started in China in the previous months, believing early diagnosis and treatment to be a strength in the battle against COVID-19.
32420927, The project makes it possible to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, using the experience acquired in the field by Chinese doctors who, first caught by this health emergency, have obtained positive results.
32420923, BI has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during COVID-19 outbreak.  Conclusions: Even if there is little evidence-based literature focused on BI impact within the health care, this study suggests that BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify clusters and patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions that can improve the EMS management response to the outbreak.
32420921, Italy is one of the most afflicted Country by this epidemic with 136,110 confirmed cases and 16,654 deaths on 9.4.2020 (at the same date, the Ministry of Health was reporting 143,626 cases).  During these few months the National Health Service have made a great effort to cope with the increasing request of intensive care beds and all the elective activities in hospital have been suspended.
32420921, Data from the different Italian regions shows different patterns of positive and dead for this syndrome.
32420921, Moreover, striking differences of the observed lethality of the infections among different areas were immediately evident from the epidemic reports.
32420921, It will be of critical relevance to understand the expected evolution of the first lock-down phase, driving the exhaustion of the Covid-19 outbreak.(www.actabiomedica.it).
32420652, To date, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak that started in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, in late December 2019 seems to be eclipsing all of these previous infectious diseases in terms of its global reach and impact (Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020).
32420652, After being declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency on 30 January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020c), it was elevated to a pandemic status on 11 March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020d).

32419875, For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably.
32419875, The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %.A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems.
32419875, Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low.
32419875, Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons..
32419772, In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers.
32419772, This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...).
32419772, Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.© 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

32419553,COVID-19 is a pandemic that is currently ravaging the world.
32419553, Infection rate is steadily increasing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
32419553, Pregnant women and their infants may suffer severe illnesses due to their lower immunity.
32419553, This guideline prepares and equips clinicians working in the maternal and newborn sections in the sub-region to manage COVID-19 during pregnancy and childbirth.
32419438, This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment.
32419438, Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus.
32419438, The purpose of this review is to identify problems related to the development of delirium during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are presented in three areas: i) factors contributing to delirium in COVID-19, ii) potential pathophysiological factors of delirium in COVID-19, and iii) long-term consequences of delirium in COVID-19.
32419438, This article discusses how healthcare workers can reduce the burden of delirium by identifying potential risk factors and difficulties during challenges associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32419167, Indeed, without nurses (and midwives) there would be no health care!. The timing of this "freak" (although not unpredictable) viral pandemic with the World Health Assembly declaration that 2020 is the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife is a poignant coincidence.
32419167, For almost 200 years we have witnessed the progressive growth of professionalisation, capacity and capability of the nursing profession globally.
32419167, In most countries in the world that survey the public trust and confidence in professional groups, most select nursing in the top group, often ahead of doctors and other noble professions.This article is protected by copyright.

32419128, During resuscitation they are wearing full personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures.The median chest compression depth using manual CC, CPRMeter and LifeLine ARM varied and amounted to 40 (38-45) vs. 45 (40-50) vs. 51 (50-52) mm, respectively (p = 0.002).
32419128, The median chest compression rate was 109 (IQR; 102-131) compressions per minute (CPM) for manual CC, 107 (105-127) CPM for CPRMeter, and 102 (101-102) CPM for LifeLine ARM (p = 0.027).
32419128, The percentage of correct chest recoil was the highest for LifeLine ARM - 100% (95-100), 80% (60-90) in CPRMeter group, and the lowest for manual CC - 29% (26-48).According to the results of this simulation trial, automated chest compression devices (ACCD) should be used for chest compression of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19.
32419128, In the absence of ACCD, it seems reasonable to change the cardiopulmonary resuscitation algorithm (in the context of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19) by reducing the duration of the CPR cycle from the current 2-min to 1-min cycles due to a statistically significant reduction in the quality of chest compressions among rescuers wearing PPE AGP.

32418559, These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures.
32418559, It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections.
32418559, Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed.
32418559, Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.
32418556, There is currently a debate on when and how such measures should be loosened.To forecast the demand for hospital ICU and non-ICU beds for COVID-19 patients from May-September, we developed two models, assuming a gradual easing of restrictions or an intermittent lockdown.We used a compartmental model to evaluate two scenarios: A) an intermittent lockdown; B) a gradual relaxation of the lockdown.
32418556, Predicted intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU demand was compared with the peak in hospital bed utilization observed in April 2020.Under scenario A, while ICU demand will remain below the peak, the number of non-ICU will substantially rise and will exceed it (133%; 95%CI: 94-171).
32418556, Under scenario B, a rise in ICU and non-ICU demand will start in July and will progressively increase over the summer 2020, reaching 95% (95%CI: 71-121) and 237% (95%CI: 191-282) of the April peak.Italian hospital demand is likely to remain high in the next months.
32418556, If restrictions are reduced, planning for the next several months should consider an increase in healthcare resources to maintain surge capacity across the country.
32418481, Public health response includes a rapid reorganization of the Italian National Healthcare System in order to reduce transmission of COVID-19 within hospitals and healthcare facilities, while optimizing the assistance to patients with severe COVID-19 complications.We analysed the actions that were taken in three ophthalmology centres in northern Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and how these measures affected patient's attendance.
32418481, In addition, due to the rapidly evolving scenario, we reviewed the evidence available during the course of this pandemic.A full reorganization of ophthalmology services is mandatory according to current existing infection containment measures in order to continue dispensing urgent procedures without endangering the community with amplification of the diffusion chain.
32418481, Ophthalmologists are considered at elevated risk of exposure when caring patients and vice versa, due to their close proximity during eye examination.
32418481, High volumes of procedures typically generated by ophthalmologists with concurrent implications on the risk of infection are considered when re-assessing healthcare facilities reorganization.Containment measures in the event of pandemic due to infective agents should be well known by healthcare professionals and promptly applied in order to mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak.
32418475,COVID-19 has taken a terrible toll on the nursing home population.
32418475, Yet, there are five times the number of seniors living in the community who are also extremely vulnerable because they suffer from respiratory illnesses.
32418475, Using the 2018 wave of the Health and Retirement Study we analyze this group of roughly 7 million seniors living in the community and find that they have multiple risk factors that make them particularly exposed.
32418475, We also show how current strategies for protecting this population may be exacerbating risks and suggest concrete steps for better protecting this group.
32418194, Building on an existing trustworthiness checklist for digital health applications, we searched the literature and developed a framework to guide the assessment of smartphone and web-based applications that aim to contribute to controlling the current epidemic or mitigating its effects.
32418194, It further integrates epidemiological subject knowledge and a legal analysis, outlining the mechanisms through which new applications can support the fight against COVID-19.
32418194, The resulting framework includes 40 questions across 8 domains on &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, &ldquo;usability&rdquo;, &ldquo;information accuracy&rdquo;, &ldquo;organisational attributes / reputation&rdquo;, &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;, &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;user control / self-determination&rdquo;. All questions should be primarily answerable from publicly available data, as provided by application manufacturers.
32418194, The framework aims to guide end users in choosing a transparent, safe and valuable application and suggests a set of information items that developers ideally make available to allow a balanced judgement and facilitate the trustworthiness of their products.
32418028, All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion.Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period.
32418028, Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission.COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course.
32418028, Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications.
32418028, These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.
32417872, Due to the different spectrum of severity with same strain of virus and uncertainty of post lockdown era, lifting the lockdown will be a trial and error approach.
32417872, Nevertheless, at some point the lockdown has to be lifted.
32417872, The strategic approach would be innumerable testing, investigations, strong contact tracing, isolation and follow-up.
32417872, In a low-income country like Nepal, this will mean negotiating a tricky balance between terminating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and allowing people to recover their livelihoods before they slip into extreme poverty and anguish.
32417709, Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon.
32417709, Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India.

32417708, While meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 474) showed a significant increase in death with HCQ, compared to the control (RR, 2.17; 95% 1.32 to 3.57; p = 0.002), without any heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.43).No benefit on viral clearance but a significant increase in mortality was observed with HCQ compared to control in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India.

32417247, In Incheon, there only was a positive but insignificant (β = 43,146, p = .056) linear relationship with the increasing numbers of new confirmed cases associated with increased traffic.New confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing.
32417247, Particularly, the fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of COVID-19 spread.
32417247, Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.Copyright © 2020.

32417246, In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of mass infection in South Korea and assess the preventive control intervention.Using opened data of daily cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, the basic and effective reproduction numbers was estimated using a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-type epidemic model.The basic reproduction number was estimated to be R0=1.77.
32417246, The effective reproduction number increased approximately 20 times after the mass infections from the 31 st patient, which was confirmed on February 9 in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Daegu.
32417246, However, the effective reproduction number decreased to less than unity after February 28 owing to the implementation of high-level preventive control interventions in South Korea, coupled with voluntary prevention actions by citizens.Preventive action and control intervention were fairly established in South Korea.Copyright © 2020.

32416357, Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19.
32416357, Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.

32415902,Recent and developing literature has begun reporting on the incidence of thromboembolic events associated with COVID-19.
32415902, Klok et al. analysed 184 SARS-CoV2-positive ICU patients in two Dutch University Hospitals, reporting an incidence of thrombotic complications to be 31%, with Pulmonary Embolism (PE) comprising 81% of these complications. [1] Moreover, Cui et al. reports on a population of 81 ICU patients at the Union Hospital, Wuhan, an incidence of 25% in VTE, also possibly related to worse prognosis.[2] Wang et al. collected data from 1026 COVID-19 positive patients in 31 provincial administrative regions in China and found 40% of the patients as high risk for VTE according to the Padua Prediction Score, with 11% being predicted to go on developing VTE. [3] Other reports and studies have also discussed the role of acute PE in COVID-19.

32415882, In this scenario, cancer specialists need to assess critical oncology patients case by case to carefully balance risk vs benefit in treating tumors and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32415882, Here, we report early insights into how the management of patients with sinonasal and anterior skull base cancer might be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415882, We provide recommendations for preoperative tests, indications for immediate care vs possible delayed treatment, and warnings relating to dural resection and intracranial dissection, given the potential neurotropism of SARS-CoV2 and practical suggestions for managing cancer care in a period of limited resources.

32415767, The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis.
32415767, Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists.
32415767, In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease.
32415767, Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder‑based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ‑of ‑the ‑art cardiovascular services.
32415585, After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively).
32415585, In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%.Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation.
32415585, However, the specificity is low.
32415585, In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.• Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.
32415494, In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective.
32415494, In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers.
32415494, NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.
32415494, The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).
32415422, Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks.
32415422, We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees.
32415422, As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities.
32415422, Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.
32415341, Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients.
32415341, Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves.There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management.
32415341, After only a few weeks, human resources are limited.
32415341, They will be the most important key for further health-care services for patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.
32415045, We aimed to evaluate HRQoL in IBD patient's pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic using the IBD-disk questionnaire and explore associations between socio demographic factors, disease types, severity and impaired HRQoL in patients with IBD.A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Saudi Arabia between November 2019 and March 2020 at the outpatient IBD clinics.
32415045, The HRQoL of patients was assessed using the 10-item IBD-disk questionnaire.A total of 59 IBD patients (40 Crohn's disease, 19 Ulcerative colitis) with a mean disease duration of 3.5 years were included.
32415045, Most of the patients (77.97%) were on biologics while 35.59% were on immune modulators, 16.94% on 5-ASA, and 3.38% were on corticosteroids.
32415045, There was no difference between any of the 10 IBD-disk variables pre and post-COVID-19 pandemic apart from the perception of body image, where there was a slightly more negative perception with an increase from 2.53 to 3.39 (P = 0.05) There was no significant difference in HRQoL between patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in any of domains.The current study showed that disability and HRQoL appears to be unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic among our cohort, however further studies with longer follow up and larger sample size is needed.
32414996, There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes.
32414996, These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment.
32414996, The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly.
32414996, Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources.These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.

32414379, Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks.
32414379, Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety.
32414379, Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale.
32414379, Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic's potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.
32414182, Conclusions: The study revealed a fairly general occurrence of unrealistic optimism, which was mainly observed in men as it appeared in all three measures, but also in women in the last two measures.
32414182, This result is important for health experts who are responsible for making people comply with regulations concerning social distancing, putting masks on to stop infection, and staying at home.
32414182, It is possible that unrealistically optimistic people will behave much less in line with the aforementioned recommendations, causing coronavirus to spread widely.
32414126, All patients sent photos on the established evening, except for two patients who sent two photos outside the set days.
32414126, In the F group, 384 photos were collected by 52 patients.
32414126, None of them sent more photos than the number that was established by the protocol.
32414126, Telemedicine allowed a monitoring of all patients, reducing costs and limiting human contact, decreasing the risk of Covid-19 dissemination.
32414076, Molecular clock analyses allowed us to estimate that the BCoV ancestor emerged in the 1940s, and that two geographically distinct lineages diverged from the 1960s-1970s.
32414076, A recombination event in the spike gene (breakpoint at nt 1100) may be at the origin of the genetic divergence sixty years ago.
32414076, Little evidence of genetic mixing between the spatially segregated lineages was found, suggesting that BCoV genetic diversity is a result of a global transmission pathway that occurred during the last century.
32414076, However, we found variation in evolution rates between the European and non-European lineages indicating differences in virus ecology.
32414013, Risk perception was significantly associated with the public's adoption of PARs.
32414013, The effects of government interventions and risk perception on the public's adoption of PARs was not found to vary by region.
32414013, Risk perception is identified as an important mediating factor between government intervention and the public's adoption of PARs.
32414013, These results indicate that increasing the public's risk perception is an effective strategy for governments seeking to encourage the public to adopt PARs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32413984, Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability.
32413984, Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences.
32413984, We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively.
32413984, Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32413821, Further, a brief review is done on the extracted information by assessing the various aspects of modern technologies for tackling COVID-19 pandemic.We provide a window of thoughts on review of the technology advances used to decrease and smother the substantial impact of the outburst.
32413821, Though different studies relating to modern technology towards COVID-19 have come up, yet there are still constrained applications and contributions of technology in this fight.On-going progress in the modern technology has contributed in improving people's lives and hence there is a solid conviction that validated research plans including artificial intelligence will be of significant advantage in helping people to fight this infection.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India.

32413112, Within 10, 20, and 30 days after the enactment of the stay-at-home order in Illinois, the difference in cases was -0.51 per 10 000 residents (SE, 0.09; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.32; P < .001), -1.15 per 10 000 residents (SE, 0.49; 95% CI, -2.12 to -0.18; P = .02), and -4.71 per 10 000 residents (SE, 1.99; 95% CI, -8.64 to -0.78; P = .02), respectively.
32413112, The estimates indicate excess cases in the border Iowa counties by as many as 217 cases after 1 month without a stay-at-home order.
32413112, This estimate of excess cases represents 30.4% of the 716 total cases in those Iowa counties by that date.
32413112, Sensitivity analyses addressing differences in timing of closing schools and nonessential businesses and differences in county population density and poverty rates between the 2 states supported these findings.This cross-sectional study with a difference-in-differences design found an increase in estimated rates of COVID-19 cases per 10 000 residents in the border counties in Iowa compared with the border counties in Illinois following a stay-at-home order that was implemented in Illinois but not in Iowa.
32412984, It is recognized that the concept of well-being is a multifaceted phenomenon which is influenced by individual, team, and system characteristics.
32412984, We outline an approach to practically initiating supportive strategies within the PICU using a well-being approach to improve baseline resilience alongside an acute rescue strategy utilizing a peer-support network.

32412914, With Indian Medical Association issuing an advisory against the use of telemedicine except in few situations, a lot of confusion exists in the mind of a pediatrician.
32412914, Despite the uncertain situation, we have to remember that other diseases shall not stall in the face of a pandemic.
32412914, Since telemedicine is an evolving subject, training of medical professionals, clear guidelines and good quality internet service systems will go a long way in increasing the acceptability of telemedicine in the Indian population.

32412532, Within a few days, it became clear that almost all forms of social interactions and teaching methods could be integrated into the virtual classroom with minor limitations.
32412532, A survey among students showed that while homeschooling cannot fully replace classroom teaching, it is considered a good alternative in emergency situations.
32412532, Furthermore, many trainees think that homeschooling could be a valuable addition to normal classroom teaching.

32412522, Through the lens of the built environment, this article provides selected insights into how various disaster, organizational, and engineering resilience activities have likely positively shaped COVID responses within the healthcare sector.
32412522, These positive influences are contextualized within extensive efforts within public health and healthcare management to calibrate community resilience frameworks and practices for utilization in everything from advancing community health to the continuity of facilities operations.
32412522, Thereafter, the article shifts focus to speculate on how ongoing experiences under COVID might yield positive impacts for future resilience designs, plans and policies within housing and the built environment.
32412522, Through this perspective, the article hopes to explore those often overlooked aspects of the physical and social parameters of the built environment that may be understood as providing opportunities to inform future disaster, public health, and climate change preparations and responses.© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.
32412422, On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released.
32412422, The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment.The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic.
32412422, This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.©Martin Komenda, Vojtěch Bulhart, Matěj Karolyi, Jiří Jarkovský, Jan Mužík, Ondřej Májek, Lenka Šnajdrová, Petra Růžičková, Jarmila Rážová, Roman Prymula, Barbora Macková, Pavel Březovský, Jan Marounek, Vladimír Černý, Ladislav Dušek.

32412416, The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers.Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method.
32412416, Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%).RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review.
32412416, Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.©Hanley J Ho, Zoe Xiaozhu Zhang, Zhilian Huang, Aung Hein Aung, Wei-Yen Lim, Angela Chow.

32412415,: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over four million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide.
32412415, A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published in scientific journals, as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination.
32412415, Yet, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is missing.The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the current SARS-CoV-2 full genome data, in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signal, to inform and guide the scientific community.We used maximum likelihood based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments, assembled from GISAID data released between March and April 2020.Although number of high quality full-genomes is growing daily, and recent sequence data released in April contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations.At the present time, studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating.
32412415, Hence, the need for interpreting current reports with caution, and continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.RR2-https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020594.
32412414, Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, χ21=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, χ21=9.0, P=.003).The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic.
32412414, As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages.
32412414, The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.©Qiuyan Liao, Jiehu Yuan, Meihong Dong, Lin Yang, Richard Fielding, Wendy Wing Tak Lam.

32412310,During the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the benefit of treating patients with cancer must be weighed against the COVID-19 infection risks to patients, staff and society.
32412310, Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and raises particular interest during the pandemic as recent reports show that the TMPRSS2 (and other serine proteases), which facilitate the entry, replication and budding of the virion from a cell, can be inhibited using androgen deprivation therapy.
32412310, Nevertheless, patients with metastatic prostate cancer commonly receive chemotherapy which may compromise their immune system.
32412310, This paper aims to address the current status of the COVID-19 in patients with cancer overall and suggests an optimal approach to patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
32412104,Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many healthcare providers face the problem of lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) including face shields.1-3 However, we need to protect ourselves using standard PPE and continue to perform necessary endoscopic procedures.
32412104, Skamnelos et. al reported a method to handmake face shields by attaching a sponge and an elastic band to an A4-size OHP transparent sheet.4 Yet, preparing such materials in large numbers can be difficult.
32412104, To solve this problem, we present an alternate, easy method to make face shields with low-cost materials along with the A4-size OHP transparent sheet.This article is protected by copyright.

32412096, Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed.
32412096, We also need more real-life evidence.
32412096, Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

32412033, The germicidal properties of ultraviolet-C are well known.
32412033, This review will cover the most commonly described methods for the sterilization of N95 respirators, namely, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vaporization, microwave-generated steaming, and dry heating.
32412033, These techniques have been tested previously and have demonstrated efficacy in reducing or inactivating viral and bacterial pathogens, although testing against SARS-CoV-2 specifically has not been done.
32412033, Moreover, it must be emphasized that proper disposal after a single use is still ideal under normal circumstances.
32411358, The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all).
32411358, With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system.
32411358, There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware.
32411358, Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.Copyright: © 2020 Pearce JM.
32411315, The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus.
32411315, Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy.
32411315, Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.
32411315, Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.© 2020 The Author(s).

32410772, Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging.
32410772, Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.
32410772, The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32410517, This study's purpose is to analyse the application of the psychological autopsy method to evaluate the impact of the pandemic where government lockdowns impose restrictions on personal freedom.
32410517, We set out to consider how far this together with other factors may induce suicide.
32410517, The literature does not as yet offer us a retrospective analysis of the influence of the global pandemic state on rates of suicide.
32410517, Accordingly, we report a forensic case and examine the critical issues and problems in the management of these cases.
32410504, In conclusion, marine natural compounds may be used as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 for better management of COVID-19.
32410502, Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile.Conclusion: This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations.
32410502, Also, this study could pave the way to potential therapeutic implication of TMPRSS2 in designing antiviral drugs.

32410003, Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19.
32410003, Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity.
32410003, But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring.
32410003, Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.
32409519, For scenarios with late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, hospital resources would be depleted within 14-26 days, and in the worst case scenario, 13 321 patients would die while waiting for needed resources.
32409519, Resource depletion would be avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to increase ICU, ventilator and acute care hospital capacities.We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures, the Ontario hospital system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19 despite a rapid increase in capacity.
32409519, This lack of hospital resources would have led to an increase in mortality.
32409519, By slowing the spread of the disease using public health measures and by increasing hospital capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its hospitals.Joule Inc. or its licensors.

32408869, Different reasons were often suggested as a means of justifying such priority groupings (e.g. appeal to best overall outcomes, fairness, belonging to a vulnerable or 'at risk' group etc.).
32408869, We suggest that much of the literature, wrongly, assumes that we are able to plan priority groups prior to the time of a particular pandemic and development of a particular vaccine.
32408869, We also point out the surprising absence of various issues from the literature (e.g. how vaccines fit within overall pandemic planning, a lack of specificity about place, issues of global justice etc.).The literature proposes a wide range of ways to prioritise vaccines, focusing on different groups and 'principles'. Any plan to use pandemic vaccine must provide justifications for its prioritisation.
32408869, The focus of this review was influenza pandemic vaccines, but lessons can be learnt for future allocations of coronavirus vaccine, if one becomes available.
32408808,Was there quality in the Chinese epidemiological surveillance system during the COVID-19 pandemic? Using data of World Health Organization's situation reports (until situation report 55), an objective analysis was realized to answer this important question.
32408808, Fulfillment of Benford's law (first digit law) is a rapid tool to suggest good data quality.
32408808, Results suggest that China had an acceptable quality in its epidemiological surveillance system.
32408808, Furthermore, more detailed and complete analyses could complement the evaluation of the Chinese surveillance system.
32408801, This communication shares these experiences with the medical community to support patient care during this difficult time and beyond.
32408801, We highlight that mastering the technological platform of choice, optimizing lighting, camera positioning, and "eye contact," being thoughtful and creative with the virtual eye examination, and ensuring good documenting and billing will make a successful and efficient VV.
32408801, Moreover, we think these ideas will stimulate further VV creativity and expertise to be developed in ophthalmology and across medicine.
32408801, This approach, holds promise for increasing its adoption after the crisis has passed.
32408793, Hypertension was associated with increased composite poor outcome (risk ratio (RR) 2.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85, 2.40), p < 0.001; I2, 44%) and its sub-group, including mortality (RR 2.21 (1.74, 2.81), p < 0.001; I2, 66%), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.04 (1.69, 2.47), p < 0.001; I2 31%), ARDS (RR 1.64 (1.11, 2.43), p = 0.01; I2,0%, p = 0.35), ICU care (RR 2.11 (1.34, 3.33), p = 0.001; I2 18%, p = 0.30), and disease progression (RR 3.01 (1.51, 5.99), p = 0.002; I2 0%, p = 0.55).
32408793, Meta-regression analysis showed that gender (p = 0.013) was a covariate that affects the association.
32408793, The association was stronger in studies with a percentage of males < 55% compared to ⩾ 55% (RR 2.32 v.
32408793, RR 1.79).Hypertension was associated with increased composite poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, ARDS, need for ICU care and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.
32408770,In this Perspective, we build on social justice and emancipatory traditions within the field of health education, and the field's long-standing commitment to building knowledge and shared power to promote health equity, to examine lessons and opportunities for health education emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.
32408770, Examining patterns that emerged as the pandemic unfolded in Metropolitan Detroit, with disproportionate impacts on African American and low-income communities, we consider conditions that contributed to excess exposure, mortality, and reduced access to critical health protective resources.
32408770, Using a life course framework, we consider enduring impacts of the pandemic for health equity.
32408770, Finally, we suggest several strategic actions in three focal areas-environment, occupation, and housing-that can be taken by health educators working in partnership with community members, researchers, and decision makers, using, for example, a community-based participatory research approach, to reduce adverse impacts of COVID-19 and promote long-term equity in health.
32408729, Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after Covid-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for Covid-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after Covid-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest.Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis.
32408729, They consist of 7 guidelines, 1 scoping review, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 descriptive studies (qualitative), 1 case series, 1 case report, and 35 expert opinions.This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020.
32408729, The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase.
32408729, Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.
32408547, Using the second approach, 85 compounds with molecular docking comparable to or greater than that of the standard inhibitor (camostat mesylate) were identified.
32408547, The top 12 compounds with the most favorable structural features were studied for physicochemical and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties.
32408547, The low-molecular-weight compound NPC306344 showed significant interaction with the active site residues of TMPRSS2, with a binding energy score of -14.69.
32408547, Further in vitro and in vivo validation is needed to study and develop an anti-COVID-19 drug based on the structures of the most promising compounds identified in this study.
32408508, Resources shortening is a critical issue when the number of COVID-19 severe cases are higher than the available resources.
32408508, This is also the case at a regional scale.
32408508, We analysed Italian data at regional level with the aim to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a geographic model to plan emergency and future COVID-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures.
32408508, Finally, we retain that the here proposed model can be also used in other countries.
32408337, Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases.
32408337, The animals remained asymptomatic during quarantine.
32408337, The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32408337, It is unclear whether infected dogs can transmit the virus to other animals or back to humans.
32408267, These data are particularly relevant to understand and mitigate the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19.
32408267, In order for such intensive and potentially intrusive data collection measures to succeed, we need a cohesive societal effort with full buy-in from citizens and their representatives.

32408222, The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by both the validation and testing sets.The multi-view deep learning fusion model achieved the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.732, accuracy of 0.700, sensitivity of 0.730 and specificity of 0.615 in validation set.
32408222, In the testing set, we can achieve AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.819, 0.760, 0.811 and 0.615 respectively.Based on deep learning method, the proposed diagnosis model trained on multi-view images of chest CT images showed great potential to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and mitigate the heavy workload of radiologists for the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32407301, During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported.
32407301, During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases.
32407301, Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing.
32407301, CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.
32407062,A new Pandemic classified by the World Health Organization and called COVID-19, is causing widespread respiratory infections and deaths in several countries on the 5 continents.
32407062, Although it does not have a high lethality rate, this new virus can present rates of complications and hospitalizations in the intensive care unit in up to 20% of patients, especially the elderly and those with compromised health, which can cause a collapse in the health system national public health.
32407062, Dentistry is one of the most vulnerable professions due to work in the oral cavity, one of the areas with the highest concentration of the virus, therefore having an important role in controlling the disease.
32407062, The objective of this work is through a review of the current literature, to establish conducts that can reduce the contamination by COVID-19 between the population and the dental team during the service in the public and private health system.
32407003, In this Personal Viewpoint essay, we shared experiences about management strategies of transplant patients outside hospital amid the epidemic.

32406853, There seems no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery over open surgery.
32406853, But do not underestimate the risks, perform surgery on COVID-19 positive patients only when necessary, and keep using logical and common sense to protect yourself and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.
32406687, With the fast-response experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently.
32406687, Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro's pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes.
32406687, By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called "anchor" site.
32406687, Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro's inhibitors with a high binding affinity.
32406406, Results showed that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat and ozone gas.

32405905, Although participants' overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission.
32405905, Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32405905, A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants' age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income.
32405905, This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.
32405877, C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis.
32405877, Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective.
32405877, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists.
32405877, Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.
32405834, The complete staff (physicians, nurses and nonmedical personnel [NMP]) underwent COVID-19 testing within two phases: (1) between Apr 3rd and 5th, 2020 [n=1170], followed by (2) between Apr 8th and 9th, 2020 [n=953] with COVID-19 silent carrier positivity rates in accordance to testing phases of (1) n=19 (1.6%) and (2) n=25 (2.6%).
32405834, The cumulative infection rate for NMP (1.6%), doctors (3.8%) and nurses (9.7%) was connected to type and extent of COVID-19 patient contact.
32405834, Despite COVID-19 positivity of 34.8% (46 of 132 beds), a risk-free management of hospital operation is possible to a certain extent if hygiene regulations and strict patient selection are followed.
32405834, However, a COVID-19-free clinic cannot be expected due to silent carriers.
32405783, Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored.
32405783, People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems.
32405783, Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.

32405232, While there are widespread reports of intentional reductions in elective hospitalizations, trends in urgent or emergent hospitalizations including heart failure (HF) hospitalizations have not been adequately characterized.We evaluated trends of HF hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center using electronic health records and discharge database.
32405232, We also compared HF hospitalization trends during the same time frame in 2019 to account for seasonal variation in HF presentations.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our medical center, a mean of 30 patients per week were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF.
32405232, After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Mississippi, there was a sharp 50% decline in the number of HF hospitalizations that declined even further after a "state of emergency" was declared in Mississippi.Based on observations from a large academic medical center, there has been a significant reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for HF during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405232, Further investigation of these trends is warranted to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term HF outcomes.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32405226, Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis.
32405226, In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
32405226, In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32405156, This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient.
32405156, This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19.

32405152, Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak.
32405152, Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required.Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings.
32405152, Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging.

32405146, This will require development of new strategies specifically targeted at decreasing the risk of decompensation and resultant HF hospitalization.
32405146, As such, we must quickly pivot to the adoption and application of novel technologies and revise usual care models, processes, and workflow.
32405146, The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis has delivered the Canadian HF community a burning platform for the design and implementation of innovative approaches to support the vulnerable population we serve; born out of necessity, we now have the opportunity to explore innovative approaches that may inform the future of HF care delivery in Canada.

32405120, Hyperglycaemia (expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose) correlates with worse outcomes in COVID-19.
32405120, It is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy.
32405120, In this article, we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy, more commonly evident in diabetes and BAME groups, makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent 'endothelitis' of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32405117, Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
32405117, The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor.

32405114, Thus, we aimed to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.: The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE.
32405114, The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers.: According to the literature, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a lack of specialized mental health services and professionals, a restricted access to quality information and a lack of access to inputs, causing negative feelings and it can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems (eg: depression, suicidal ideation, smoking and binge drink).

32405058, Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, guidance by scientific evidence is often unavailable, and impactful decisions are inevitably made on the basis of expert opinions.
32405058, Here we report how the seven comprehensive cancer centers of Cancer Core Europe have organized their healthcare systems at an unprecedented scale and pace to make their operations 'pandemic proof'. We identify and discuss many commonalities, but also important local differences, and pinpoint critical research priorities to enable evidence-based remodeling of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405058, Also, we discuss how the current situation offers a unique window of opportunity for assessing the effects of de-escalating anticancer regimens, which may fast-forward the development of more-refined and less-toxic treatments.
32405058, By sharing our joint experiences, we offer a roadmap for proceeding and aim to mobilize the global research community to generate the data that are critically needed to offer the best possible care to patients.
32404975, The true impact on stem cell transplant and CAR T-cell recipients in unknown.
32404975, The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) has therefore developed recommendations for transplant programs and physicians caring for these patients.
32404975, These guidelines were developed by experts from the Infectious Diseases Working Party and have been endorsed by EBMT's scientific council and board.
32404975, This work intends to provide guidelines for transplant centers, management of transplant candidates and recipients, and donor issues until the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.
32404797, To overcome the limitations of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab, especially oscillating sensitivity, we added the information obtained from phone calls to discharged patients with negative initial RT-PCR.
32404797, Thus, we included 535 patients with concomitant CXR and RT-PCR on admission (aged 65±17 y; 340 males, 195 females), resulting in 408 RT-PCR positive and 127 negative patients at the composite reference standard.
32404797, Original CXR reports showed an 89.0% sensitivity (95% confidence intervals [CI], 85.5%-91.8%), 60.6% specificity (95% CI, 51.6%-69.2%), 87.9% positive predictive value (95% CI, 84.4%-90.9%), and 63.1% negative predictive value (95% CI, 53.9%-71.7%).
32404797, The adoption of CXR alongside RT-PCR to triage patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a safe and efficient workflow, counteracting possible false negative RT-PCR results.
32404721, The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed.
32404721, We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses.Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery.
32404721, In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment.The deferment of elective surgical cases during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the United States health-care system.
32404721, As part of disaster mitigation, it is critical to start planning for recovery now.
32404652, In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface.
32404652, This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic.
32404652, In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a "tele-bridge" clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment.
32404652, In this correspondence we briefly share our experience developing this common sense approach to addressing the complex problem of access to treatment only now permissible due to regulatory changes during COVID-19.
32404630, The mean age was 61.7, BMI was 32.6, and the pre-tracheostomy ventilator day was 20.4.
32404630, The indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning and continued respiratory with hypoxia.
32404630, Failed extubation attempt rate was 16.7% and hemodialysis rate was 38.9%. All patients were hemodynamically stable, without any evidence of accelerating cytokine storm.
32404630, To date there was one minor bleeding due to postoperative therapeutic anticoagulation.This report describes a method of performing open tracheostomy with minimal aerosolization using readily available equipment and supplies in most hospitals.
32404481, Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures.
32404481, Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform.
32404481, VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature.
32404481, We further discuss how we met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting including use of staged, assembly line for VTM transport tube production.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.
32404476, By 11 May 2020, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 2.8 million (range: 1.8-4.7) people, or 4.4% (range: 2.8-7.2) of the population, will have been infected.

32404170, By contrast, the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far represents approximately 1.0% of the total deaths expected to occur worldwide over the first three months of the current year.
32404170, It seems, therefore, that the number of infants expected to be conceived and born -but who will not be so due to the lockdown of infertility services- might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32404170, We herein propose remedies that include a prognostic-stratification of more vulnerable infertility cases in order to plan a progressive restart of worldwide fertility treatments.
32404170, At a time when preventing complications and limiting burdens for national health systems represent relevant issues, our viewpoint might help competent authorities and health care providers to identify patients who should be prioritized for the continuation of fertility care in a safe environment.
32404050, Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys).
32404050, Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%.The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period.
32404050, Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didn't, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful.
32404050, These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.
32404043, Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence.Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China.
32404043, This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.
32403995, Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains.
32403995, Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.
32403995, Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2.
32403995, Thus, we aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic antibodies as well as diagnostics.
32403894, Solutions to operating room specific concerns were also discussed.
32403894, This article reflects the opinions and insights shared during this meeting and reviews the evidence relevant to the issues that were raised.
32403894, The rapid consensus reached during the teleconference has enabled us to be concerted, and thus stronger, in our national efforts to provide the best standard of care via our spine services in these challenging times.
32403894, We believe that this article will provide some guidance for addressing COVID-19 in spine surgery and encourage other national/regional societies to conduct similar discussions that would help their navigation of this pandemic.
32403248, The aim of this paper is to present a workflow to manage dental procedures already in use at the Dental Unit of the University Hospital of Messina.
32403248, The proposed workflow accounts for the many aspects of dental practitioners' risk in the COVID-19 era, and focuses on the assessment of patient risk level, a two-phase dental procedure management (remote and face-to-face), and the use of specific preventive measures.
32403248, No cases of COVID-19 infection were detected among patients and staff of the dental unit in a two-month period of time while using this protocol.
32403248, This workflow seems a promising and effective solution to manage dental procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak, and could be implemented in both public and private practices until the emergency is contained.
32403209,To analysis the anxiety status of Chinese medical workers during the epidemic of COVID-19 by meta-analysis method.CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data, SinoMed, PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar and other databases were searched to collect literature on the anxiety status of Chinese medical workers during the epidemic of COVID-19.
32403209, The retrieval time is from the database construction to 11/03/2020.
32403209, Meta-analysis was performed on the included articles by using Stata 16.0 software.A total of 7 articles were included, with a total sample size of 7,741 people.
32403209, Meta-analysis using the random effects model showed that the anxiety score of Chinese medical during the epidemic of COVID-19 was significantly higher than that of the national norm in each study, the difference was statistically significant [SMD (95% CI)=1.145 (0.705-1.584), p<0.001].The anxiety level of Chinese medical workers has increased significantly during the epidemic of COVID-19.
32403190, Procedures can be carried out in the community and can be conducted safely during the coronavirus pandemic.
32403190, It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy.As colonoscopy services resume, they will likely experience high demand leading to further delays for patients.
32403190, CCE could be used to reduce the number of patients requiring colonoscopy and triage those requiring further endoscopic investigations appropriately.This article is protected by copyright.

32403141, Among these neonates, three were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 16, 36, and 72 hours after birth, respectively, by nasopharyngeal swab real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; another six had elevated virus-specific antibody levels in serum samples collected after birth, but negative RT-PCR test results.
32403141, However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission. There is currently no direct evidence to support intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32403141, Additional RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are needed to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission.
32403141, For pregnant women infected during their first and second trimesters, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are needed.· We review neonates of mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).. · No direct virologic evidence of vertical transmission has been reported.. · No evidence that cesarean delivery is safer than vaginal delivery.. · More RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are recommended..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.
32403007, Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa (κ) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load.Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC).
32403007, SC was highly concordant with HC (κ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (κ = 0.959 vs 0.933).
32403007, Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT.Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32402928, The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas.
32402928, Despite the significant decrease in NO2 in the TL, the O3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration.
32402928, In Milan and SaA the increase was more accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O3 in a more significant way.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32402910, The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities.
32402910, The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012).
32402910, The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 °C ≤ T < 20 °C than in other temperature ranges, while the RR of COVID-19 transmission associated with AQI was higher in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10% ≤ RH < 20%.

32402186, The combinatorial design of peptide-based inhibitors targeting the dimerization of SARS-CoV Mpro represents a potential therapeutic strategy.
32402186, In this regard, we have compiled the literature reports highlighting the effect of mutations and N-terminal deletion of residues of SARS-CoV Mpro on its dimerization and, thus, catalytic activity.
32402186, We believe that the present review will stimulate research in this less explored yet quite significant area.
32402186, The effect of the COVID-19 epidemic and the possibility of future CoV outbreaks strongly emphasize the urgent need for the design and development of potent antiviral agents against CoV infections.
32401934, There are significant differences by sex on the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05) and in the risk of waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), tooth extraction ((p < 0.05), endodontics (p < 0.05) and fillings ((p < 0.05).
32401934, Women consider the risk to be higher than men do.
32401934, The risk group (over 60 and with systemic disease) has significant differences on the subscales of infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01).
32401934, Our study shows high levels of vulnerability regarding contracting COVID-19 and avoiding dental care as perceived by the population over 60 years old and with a systemic disease.
32401686, A diverse group of medical oncologists met to formulate detailed practical advice on systemic anticancer treatments during this crisis.
32401686, In the context of broad principles, issues including risks of treatment, principles of prioritizing resources, treatment of elderly patients, and psychosocial impact are discussed.
32401686, Detailed treatment advice and options are given at a tumor stream level.
32401686, We must maintain care for patients with cancer as best we can and recognize that COVID-19 poses a significant competing risk for death that changes conventional treatment paradigms.
32401442, Some experimental data suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase ACE2 levels, thus raising concerns on their security in Covid-19 positive patients.
32401442, However, some studies have shown protection by these drugs in lower tract respiratory infections and ARDS.
32401442, The actual consensus is to continue the treatment with RAAS inhibitors, abrupt withdrawal, especially in patients with cardiac or renal conditions, being hazardous in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, except in patients hospitalized in intensive care with hemodynamic instability.
32401442, This position statement is actually unanimous among all international learned societies.
32401228, Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm.
32401226, The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported.
32401226, Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate.
32401226, Also, the rate of cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 women is unacceptably high.
32401226, Here we provide arguments for NOT changing the existing guidelines and caution against cesarean delivery that was the prevalent delivery mode in the reported cases and case series.
32401219, Overall, response sentiments for the MOH posts (PNSR 0.94) were more favorable compared to response sentiments for the CDC (PNSR 0.57) and PHE (PNSR 0.55) posts.
32401219, Toxic comments were rare (0.01%) across all PHAs.PHAs' extent of Facebook use for outreach purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied among the three PHAs, highlighting the strategies and approaches that other PHAs can potentially adopt.

32401085, Key decisions from the pandemic response teams that help to minimise major disruptions in medical education and to control disease transmissions include: minimising inter-cluster cross contaminations and plans for segregation within and among cohorts; reshuffling academic calendars; postponing or restructuring assessments.Conclusions: While minimising the transmission of the pandemic outbreak within the healthcare establishments is paramount, medical education and research activities cannot come to a standstill each time there is a threat of one.
32400349, The fifth sample contained chloroquine, but only 22% of the declared amount.
32400349, Such products represent a serious risk to patients.
32400349, Their occurrence exemplifies that once medicines or vaccines against COVID-19 may be developed, falsified products will enter the market immediately, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
32400349, Timely preparations for the detection of such products are required, including the establishment of appropriate screening technologies in LMICs.
32400291, Empiric evidence demonstrates that these babies can derive significant survival benefits from ventilation when compared to adults.
32400291, When "triaging" or choosing between patients, justice demands fair guidelines.

32399902,This paper is part of Forum COVID-19: Perspectives in the Humanities and Social Sciences.
32399902, In the current COVID 19 pandemic, the importance of professional nursing is widely recognized.
32399902, In German-speaking and international research, the history of nursing during pandemics and epidemics is largely unwritten.
32399902, This paper gives an overview of questions and results in this research area and discusses the potential of a pandemic nursing history.
32399806,SARS-CoV-2 viruses are positive single-stranded RNA viruses, whose infection can be asymptomatic or lead to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
32399806, Covid-19 is a respiratory infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis leading to several cardiovascular complications.
32399806, Hematologic consequences of this new infection allowed medical community to start new treatment approaches concerning infection going from targeted anti-inflammatory drugs to anticoagulation or stem cell therapies.
32399806, A better understanding of Covid-19 pathophysiology, in particular hematological disorders, will help to choose appropriate treatment strategies.
32399755, Currently, COVID-19 represents a health emergency worldwide, leading, in severe cases, to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction or failure, and death.
32399755, In the context of limited scientific knowledge and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, guidance is becoming increasingly necessary for pathologists who have to perform postmortem investigations on COVID-19 cases.
32399755, The aim of the present report is to share a procedure applicable to cases of COVID-19-related death, particularly in cases of death without medical intervention and in the absence of an ascertained SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 diagnosis, therefore providing support for diagnostic activity in the present COVID-19 pandemic.
32399755, For this purpose, a standard operating procedure for correct swab collection, autopsy investigation and tissue sampling is provided.
32399515, We speculate that while African nations are currently experiencing much lower rates of COVID-19 relative to other continents, their significantly lower testing rates may grossly underestimate incidence rates.
32399515, Failure to grasp the true picture may mean crucial windows of opportunity shut unutilized, while limited resources are not deployed to maximum effect.
32399515, In the absence of extensive testing data, an overestimation of spread may lead to disproportionate measures being taken, causing avoidable strain on livelihoods and economies.
32399515, Here, based on the African situation, we discuss COVID-19 diagnostic challenges and how they may blunt responses.Copyright: © 2020 Kobia F and Gitaka J.
32399501, Undertaking the following activities at least once in the previous week was associated with illness onset: using a bus, (aOR 1.48, p=0.049), shopping at small shops (1.9, p<0.002) attending a place of worship (1.81, p=0.005).    Conclusions: Exposure to potentially crowded places, public transport and to individuals with a cold increases risk of acquiring circulating acute respiratory infections.
32399501, This suggests social distancing measures can have an important impact on slowing transmission of emerging respiratory infections.Copyright: © 2020 Hayward AC et al.
32399094, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs - favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir - were used as standards for comparison.The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were -6.8, -5.8, -7.9, -7.9, -7.0, -7.7, -6.6, -8.2, -7.4, -7.7, and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively.
32399094, The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds.These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.
32399094, This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors.
32399094, However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential use as drugs for COVID-19.Copyright: © 2020 Termedia & Banach.
32399092, Recommendations for herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak have featured in Chinese national guidelines and policies, but UK strategies have no such guidance.

32398890, Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis.
32398890, We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health.
32398890, We then investigate how COVID-19 can potentiate digital inequalities, and how digital inequalities potentiate vulnerability to COVID-19.
32398890, Finally, in order to contribute to the mitigation of this crisis, we propose a set of multi-layered strategies focusing on actionability that can be implemented at multiple structural levels, ranging from governmental to corporate and community levels.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

32398875, Proinflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages were abundant in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-9.
32398875, Moderate cases were characterized by the presence of highly clonally expanded CD8+ T cells.
32398875, This atlas of the bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment suggests potential mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and recovery in COVID-19.
32398273, We provide 106 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured' regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA.
32398273, We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the extended 5' UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3' UTR.
32398273, Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome that have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains.
32398273, These 59 'SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured' genomic regions may be most easily targeted in primer-based diagnostic and oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.
32398188, The authors describe an inexpensive, disposable, positive-pressure head isolation unit that can be rapidly constructed from materials readily available in nearly all health care settings for under five US dollars.
32398188, The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32398188, The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source.
32398188, This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.
32397847, Conclusion: Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF contain antibodies reacting against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
32397847, Studies to confirm the utility of IVIG preparations for COVID-19 management may be warranted.
32397844, This paper conducts a comparative study of the use of the recent deep learning models (VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet201, Inception_ResNet_V2, Inception_V3, Resnet50, and MobileNet_V2) to deal with detection and classification of coronavirus pneumonia.
32397844, The experiments were conducted using chest X-ray & CT dataset of 6087 images (2780 images of bacterial pneumonia, 1493 of coronavirus, 231 of Covid19, and 1583 normal) and confusion matrices are used to evaluate model performances.
32397844, Results found out that the use of inception_Resnet_V2 and Densnet201 provide better results compared to other models used in this work (92.18% accuracy for Inception-ResNetV2 and 88.09% accuracy for Densnet201).Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32397762,There is a critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) around the globe.
32397762, This article describes the safe collection, storage, and decontamination of N95 respirators using hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV).
32397762, This article is unique because it describes the HPV process in an operating room, and is therefore, a deployable method for many healthcare settings.
32397762, Results presented here offer creative solutions to the current PPE shortage.
32397699, Conclusion: There is no age and gender specific differences in the Tg of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo, and COVID-19 has high infectivity and spreading power in early phase.
32397697, Conclusions: COVID-19 is highly infectious in the incubation period.
32397697, The more confined the space is, the higher the risk is,and the longer the single exposure is, the higher the risk of transmission is.
32397697, Indirect contact transmission still exists.
32397286, We develop a `mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR epidemiological model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method.
32397286, The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor ×8 (95%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8) based on hospital death counting data.
32397286, Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8% (95%-CI: 0.45-1.25).
32397286, This IFR is consistent with previous findings in China (0.66%) and in the UK (0.9%) and lower than the value previously computed on the Diamond Princess cruse ship data (1.3%).
32397275, Older adults are also more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), with advanced age being the single greatest risk factor.
32397275, In addition to its immune-system-modulating effects, it has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing PD progression and improving PD-related quality of life.
32397275, We completed a review of the literature to determine the relationship between vitamin D, PD, and COVID-19.
32397275, We concluded that the daily supplementation of 2000-5000 IU/day of vitamin D3 in older adults with PD has the potential to slow the progression of PD while also potentially offering additional protection against COVID-19.
32397199, The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19.
32397199, Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment.
32397199, Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis.
32397199, Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province.
32397199, This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time.
32397199, In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.
32396986, Topics with direct relevance for frontline staff were identified.
32396986, The consensus guidance includes: infectivity of patients with respect to tracheostomy indications and timing; aerosol-generating procedures and risks to staff; insertion procedures; and management following tracheostomy.
32396986, These consensus recommendations are based on expert opinion and informed by the best available evidence and published guidance where possible.This article is protected by copyright.

32396922, Pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs.
32396922, High viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding.
32396922, Taken together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases.
32396922, The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and will aid development and testing of medical countermeasures.
32396773, The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2.
32396773, Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics.
32396773, This is the first MD simulation based findings to provide a high affinity protein inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, an important target for drug designing against this unprecedented challenge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32396767, It is observed that α-ketoamide is more potent compared to lopinavir and darunavir.
32396767, In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to α-ketoamide.
32396767, On the other hand, in the case of darunavir, a decrease in the favorable intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals interactions contributes to lower affinity compared to α-ketoamide.
32396767, Our study might help in designing rational anti-coronaviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
32396710,Coronaviridae (CoVs) are single stranded RNA viruses. βeta-CoVs encompasses Bat coronavirus (BCoV), the human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus.
32396710, In December 2019, a new βeta-CoVs was identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2.
32396710, The genome sequencing demonstrated a 79.5% and 96.2% identity to SARS-CoV and a bat CoV genome, respectively, supporting the interspecies transmission and the origin of this new pandemia.This article is protected by copyright.

32396601, The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel.
32396601, Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications.During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities.
32396601, Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage.
32396601, Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.© 0000 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.
32396550, Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses.
32396550, Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%).
32396550, Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7-22.9).
32396550, As influenza A and B viruses were commonly associated with SARI and are treatable, SARI patients entering these hospitals would benefit if the hospitals were able to adapt onsite molecular diagnostics.
32396516, Over half the participants (n=5878, 57.7%) were confident that the epidemic could be curbed in China; 92.4% (n=9427) opened windows for ventilation more frequently than usual; 97.9% (n=9986) used masks in public; 95.7% (n=9759) avoided large crowds and stayed at home as much as possible; and 97.9% (n=9988) washed their hands more often than usual.
32396516, Women were more likely to practice these behaviors than men (P<.001).
32396516, With a series of strict public control measures, like nationwide health education campaigns, holiday extensions, the Examine and Approve Policy on the resumption of work, close management of working and living quarters, a health QR (Quick Response) code system, community screening, and social distancing policies, the number of new cases have decreased dramatically since February 12, 2020.The methods employed by Chinese citizens and authorities have effectively curtailed the spread of COVID-19, demonstrating that this pandemic can be brought under control as long as the right measures are taken.©Yu Huang, Qingqing Wu, Ping Wang, Yan Xu, Lei Wang, Yusui Zhao, Dingming Yao, Yue Xu, Qiaohong Lv, Shuiyang Xu.

32396447, To assess whether paid sick leave is available in countries around the world, we created and analysed a database of legislative guarantees of paid leave for personal illness in 193 UN member states.
32396447, Original labour and social security legislation and global information on social security systems for each country were obtained and analysed by a multilingual research team using a common coding framework.
32396447, While strong models exist across low- middle- and high-income countries, critical gaps that jeopardise health and economic security remain. 27% of countries do not guarantee paid sick leave from the first day of illness, essential to encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick and prevent spread. 58% of countries do not have explicit provisions to ensure self-employed and gig economy workers have access to paid sick leave benefits.
32396447, Comprehensive paid sick leave policies that cover all workers are urgently needed if we are to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and be ready to respond to threats from new pathogens.
32396400, Time >180 mg/dl and >250 mg/dl were reduced from 36.0±17.2 to 32.6±17.5 (p<0.001) and from 11.9±11.8 to 9.4±10.3%, (p=0.001), respectively.
32396400, Time in hypoglycaemia remained unchanged.
32396400, Estimated HbA1c and time in range 70-180 mg/dl showed an improvement in 62% (n=91) of the subjects.
32396400, Sensor use (93%) and coefficient of variation (36%) remained unchanged.No deterioration in glycaemic control was found as a result of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32396397, Conclusions: Research and audit activities will resume and we will find new ways for supporting pregnant women with diabetes to choose their preferred glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.
32396395, Conclusion: Automatic consults for COVID-19 patients ensure that patients with serious illness receive specialized diabetes care.
32396395, Transitioning to virtual care models does not limit the glycemic outcomes of inpatient diabetes care and should be employed to reduce patient and provider exposure in the setting of COVID-19.
32396395, These findings may have implications for reducing nosocomial infection in less challenging times and might address shortage of health care providers, especially in the remote areas.
32396261, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus.
32396261, Health care providers at the front lines are at high risk of getting the infection and the risk applies also to laboratory personnel as they deal with specimens that might be contaminated with infectious materiel.
32396261, Cytopathology teams specifically are at high risk of dealing with contaminated material because of patients encounter during fine-needle aspiration biopsies or Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) for adequacy.
32396261, In our article, we discuss alternative safer staining methods to the widely used Diff-Quick stain that can be utilized for ROSE to decrease the risk of viral exposure during the current COVID-19 pandemic.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32396126, First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend.
32396126, Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction.
32396126, The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic.
32396126, Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.
32395910,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a very heterogeneous disease.
32395910, Some aspects of COVID-19 pneumonia question the real nature of ground glass opacities and its consolidative lesions.
32395910, It has been hypothesized that COVID-19 lung involvement could represent not only a viral effect but also an immune response induced by the infection, causing epithelial/endothelial lesions and coagulation disorders.
32395910, We report 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound was suggestive of consolidations with perfusion defects, at least in part caused by ischemic or necrotic changes and not only by inflammatory or atelectasis events.© 2020 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

32395789, The data was collected using the "Delphi" technique in one turn, based on an electronic form such as "Google Form", developed according to SWOT analysis.
32395789, The respondents' verbatim was grouped into homogeneous groups of items, the occurrence of which was subsequently measured.A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years.
32395789, The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe.
32395789, The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics.The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.
32395696, The peak density of lesions appeared at the range of - 500 to - 700 HU on density histogram.
32395696, In the intermediate-stage (4-6 days), the mean percentage of lung involvement noticeably increased compared with that in early stage (7%, p < 0.05).
32395696, In late stage (7-14 days), the percentage of lung involvement decreased to 5%. The mean density of lesions was the highest (- 430 ± 80), and heterogeneity density distribution showed a dual-peak on density histogram.COVID-19 can be promptly detected by QCT.

32395541, These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination.
32395541, Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.

32395187, Average glucose declined from 177 ± 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 ± 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly.
32395187, Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016).
32395187, The number of scans per day remained unchanged.
32395187, In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown.Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.© The Author(s) 2020.
32395096, The FCV-19S was significantly correlated with the nine-item Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-90) (r = 0.406, p < 0.001).
32395096, FCV-19S scores were significantly associated with higher worries concerning lockdown.
32395096, Measurement invariance of the FCV-19S showed no differences with respect to age or gender.
32395096, The Bangla version of FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool with robust psychometric properties which will be useful for researchers carrying out studies among the Bangla speaking population in assessing the psychological impact of fear from COVID-19 infection during this pandemic.© The Author(s) 2020.

32394236, On ICU admission, prothrombin time was slightly reduced and it increased significantly at T10 (T0 = 65.1 ± 9.8 vs T10 = 85.7 ± 1.5, p = 0.002), while activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen values were higher at T0 than T10 (32.2 ± 2.9 vs 27.2 ± 2.1, p = 0.017 and 895.1 ± 110 vs 332.5 ± 50, p = 0.002, respectively); moreover, whole blood thromboelastometry profiles were consistent with hypercoagulability characterized by an acceleration of the propagation phase of blood clot formation [i.e., CFT below the lower limit in INTEM 16/40 patients (40%) and EXTEM 20/40 patients (50%)] and significant higher clot strength [MCF above the upper limit in INTEM 20/40 patients (50%), in EXTEM 28/40 patients (70%) and in FIBTEM 29/40 patients (72.5%)]; however, this hypercoagulable state persists in the first five days, but it decreases ten day after, without returning to normal values.
32394236, No sign of secondary hyperfibrinolysis or sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) were found during the study period.
32394236, In six patients (15%) a deep vein thrombosis and in 2 patients (5%) a thromboembolic event, were found; 12 patients (30%) had a catheter-related thrombosis.
32394236, ROTEM analysis confirms that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had a hypercoagulation state that persisted over time.

32393562, It is important for health care systems worldwide to recognize the value of a strong coordinated response to this crisis from a primary health perspective.
32393562, There are best practices for early isolation and containment of suspect cases while protecting health care workers and limiting cross infections that are transferable across nations.
32393562, We describe our framework for how our primary care clinics respond to this pandemic in the hope others may find solutions to their unique needs.
32393562, Moving forward, there is a pressing need for more studies to enhance our understanding of the response of primary care during these public health crises.© 2020 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.
32393458, Apart from Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 26 other countries as on February 18, 2020.
32393458, Of these 26 countries, the cases of Covid-19 have been exported directly from China in 23 of them.
32393458, As on February 23, 2020, a total of 78,811 confirmed cases, 2445 deaths have been reported globally.
32393458, The World Health Organization declared this as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 (5).
32393447, The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic.
32393447, In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications.
32393447, In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

32393441,Early last month, the Italian Society of Anaesthesia was forced to publish the above guideline (1) for the country's hospitals.
32393441, Besides the rising cases of infection, the doctors realised that patients required up to 15-20 days of intensive care as the disease progressed (2).
32393441, In the face of medical resource scarcities, the guideline established that everyone could not be saved from the coronavirus.
32393441, And a massive death toll ensued.
32393394, Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe.
32393394, Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word "immune" were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance.Internet analytics are an effective way for regulators to monitor internet activity to protect the public from misleading statements.
32393394, The processes described were effective at bringing about rapid practitioner compliance.
32393394, Given the increasing volume of internet activity by healthcare professionals, internet analytics are an important addition for health care regulators to protect the public they serve.
32393101, Among subspecialties, a larger proportion of completed visits in 2020 were performed by pediatric and head and neck oncology otolaryngologists as compared with general/specialty otolaryngologists (P < .001).
32393101, Older adults (≥65 years) were less likely to have telehealth visits than younger adults (18-64 years; 45.6% vs 59.6%, P = .003).A major decrease in the completion rates of scheduled visits was seen in the COVID-19-affected period, though this was not proportional among subspecialties.
32393101, An associated increase in telehealth visits was observed.
32393101, After COVID-19-related hospital policy changes, approximately 2 weeks passed before telehealth visits surpassed in-person visits, though this was not true among older adults.
32392880, One week after the introduction of strict measures, the increase in daily new cases was reversed, and the reproduction number dropped.
32392880, The crude estimates tended to overestimate the reproduction rate in the early phase.
32392880, Publicly available data provide a first estimate about the effectiveness of public health measures.
32392880, However, more data are needed for an unbiased assessment.
32392759, There is a potentially rich and fruitful reservoir of such compounds thanks to the plethora of bioactive molecules and families present in marine microorganisms.
32392759, The aim of this communication is to present the state-of-play of what is known on the antiviral activities recognized in (micro)algae, highlighting the different molecules from various algae and their mechanisms of actions, when known.
32392759, Given the ability of various algal molecules-mainly sulfated polysaccharides-to inhibit viral infection at Stage I (adsorption and invasion of cells), we envisage a need to further investigate the antiviral ability of algae, and their mechanisms of action.
32392759, Given the advantages of microalgal production compared to other organisms, the opportunity might become reality in a short period of time.
32392624, Considering the value of distributive justice, with respect to triage, a "soft utilitarian" approach was advocated with the main criteria being function and comorbidity.
32392624, Although chronological age was rejected as a sole criterion, in the case of an overwhelming crisis, "biological age" would enter into the triage considerations, but only in the case of distinguishing between people with equal non-age-related deficits.
32392624, The guideline emphasized that no matter what, in the spirit of beneficence, anyone who fell ill must receive active palliative care throughout the course of a COVD-19 infection but especially at the end of life.

32391661, Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted.
32391661, By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed.The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province.
32391661, Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people.
32391661, In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people.The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.

32389144, The mean reading level for nearly all noncommercial and commercial websites was at or above the 10th grade reading level.Messages about COVID-19 must be readable at an "easy" level, and must contain clear guidelines for behavior.
32389144, The degree to which individuals seek information in response to risk messages is positively related to the expectation that the information will resolve uncertainty.
32389144, However, if the information is too complex to interpret and it fails to lead to disambiguation, this can contribute to feelings of panic.
32388976, Due to its high virulence and the absence of immunity among the general population, SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread to all countries.
32388976, This pandemic highlights the urgent unmet need to expand and focus our research tools on what are considered "neglected infectious diseases" and to prepare for future inevitable pandemics.
32388976, This global emergency has generated unprecedented momentum and scientific efforts around the globe unifying scientists from academia, government and the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate the discovery of vaccines and treatments.
32388976, Herein, we shed light on the virus structure and life cycle and the potential therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 and briefly refer to both active and passive immunization modalities, drug repurposing focused on speed to market, and novel agents against specific viral targets as therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.
32388934, Conclusion: Regions with different economic level, population scale, and different prevention and control capabilities should all initiate scientific assessment of medical resource requirement under emergency response and prepare for possible future rebound and epidemic.
32388476, Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS-CoV-2.
32388476, Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people.

32388468, This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals.Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages.
32388468, Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources.We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations.We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively.
32388468, We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate.These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32388138, Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen.
32388138, Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission.
32388138, Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32388137, Our results showed that higher mean temperatures and average relative humidity favored the COVID-19 transmission, differently from reports from coldest countries or periods of time under cool temperatures.
32388137, Thus, considering the results obtained, intersectoral policies and actions are necessary, mainly in cities where the contamination rate is increasing rapidly.
32388137, Thus, prevention and protection measures should be adopted in these cities aiming to reduce transmission and the possible collapse of the health system.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32386449, To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies.
32386449, Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done.In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta-analysis.
32386449, Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference = -4.24 g/L, 95% CI = -6.20 to -2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection.The incidence of liver injury, as assessed by serum analysis (AST, ALT, total Bilirubin and Albumin levels), seems to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32386147, To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability.
32386147, Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia.
32386147, In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes.
32386147, Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.
32385976, However, with predominant respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases, chest imaging using computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in detecting viral lung infection, evaluating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions, and monitoring the disease activity.
32385976, The role of chest CT as a diagnostic tool may be increased when the laboratory testing capacities using RT-PCR prove inaccurate or insufficient during a major outbreak of the disease.
32385976, In these settings, a rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 potentially offered by CT might be an advantage, in addition to obvious benefits of delineating the nature and extent of pulmonary changes.
32385976, In the present paper, we reviewed the diagnostic role of chest CT in COVID-19 patients.
32385869, We will review COVID-19 from both a dermatologic and public health perspective.

32385458, There are differing government financial mitigations in place across dental practices for NHS and, to an extent private, activity, as well as for the dental industry.
32385458, Dentistry is generally classified in the very high-risk category of aerosol production through many aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
32385458, To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved.
32385458, From a dental industry perspective, equipment and product manufacturers and suppliers are building upon, and further developing, the industry's extremely close relationship and partnership with the dental profession, in order to develop and implement new ways of thinking and new approaches, products and techniques to protect patients and clinicians, focusing on a return to the more widespread provision of dentistry.
32385187, Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing.
32385187, We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents.Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum.It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis.
32385187, The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork.
32385187, We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training.© 2020 American Academy of Neurology.
32385186, As caregivers, we are guided by 3 distinct principles that will occasionally conflict during the pandemic: (1) We must ensure the best care for those stricken with COVID-19, (2) We must provide excellent care and advocacy for patients with cerebrovascular disease and their families, and (3) We must advocate for the safety of healthcare personnel managing patients with stroke, with particular attention to those most vulnerable, including trainees.
32385186, This descriptive review by a diverse group of experts in stroke care aims to provide advice by specifically addressing the potential impact of this pandemic on: (1) the quality of the stroke care delivered, (2) ethical considerations in stroke care, (3) safety & logistic issues for providers of stroke patients, and (4) stroke research.
32385186, Our recommendations on these issues represent our best opinions given the available information, but are subject to revision as the situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.
32385186, We expect that ongoing emergent research will offer additional insights that will provide evidence that could prompt the modification or removal of some of these recommendations.© 2020 American Academy of Neurology.
32385067, Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020).In univariate analyses, there were few or no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99).
32385067, Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85).
32385067, In a multivariable model, there was a strong association with the number of implemented public health interventions (p for trend = 0.001), whereas the association with absolute humidity was no longer significant.Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with latitude and temperature, but may be associated weakly with relative or absolute humidity.
32385067, Conversely, public health interventions were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth.Joule Inc. or its licensors.
32384820, Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available.
32384820, Here, we detailed how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2.
32384820, We also made all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH.
32384820, Furthermore, we demonstrated how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles could be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.
32384377, Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60 cm in radius.Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site.
32384377, Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate.
32384377, Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30 cm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, p = 0.0066).Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment.
32384377, A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.
32384297, Duarte's elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to >1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections.
32384297, However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively.We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above.
32384297, In summary, 2 different approaches indicated similar ranges of undetected infections in North America.Prognostic Level V.

32384019, Conclusions An AI system for detection of COVID-19 on chest radiographs was comparable to six independent readers.
32383989, Conclusion: Acute diabetes complication like DKA increases morbidity and mortality in addition to adding cost to the health care system.
32383989, The current pandemic of COVID-19 has allowed newer ways (with the help of newer technologies) to manage high-risk patients with T1D and DKA through telehealth and may result in lasting benefits to people with T1D.
32383802, Different studies suggest OCD to affect up to 3.1 % of the general population and to be associated with substantial disability and decreased quality of life (Fontenelle, Mendlowicz, & Versiani, 2006; Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010).

32383576, Outpatient activities stopped for 87%, involving 318,000 patients per day in Italy, Belgium and UK, leading to an estimate range of 1,3-2,2 million in Europe.
32383576, Seven countries reported experiences on rehabilitation for acute Covid-19 patients.Covid-19 emergency is having a huge impact on rehabilitation of people experiencing disability.
32383576, This may lead to future cumulative effects due to reduced functional outcome and consequent increased burden of care.
32383576, When the emergency will fade, rehabilitation demand will probably grow due to an expected return wave of these not well treated patients, but probably also of post-Covid-19 patients' needs.
32383532,Tracheostomy procedures have a high risk of aerosol generation.
32383532, Airway providers have reflected on ways to mitigate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission risks when approaching a surgical airway.
32383532, To standardize institutional safety measures with tracheostomy, we advocate using a dedicated tracheostomy time-out applicable to all patients including those suspected of having COVID-19.
32383532, The aim of the tracheostomy time-out is to reduce preventable errors that may increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32383432,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has unveiled underlying health inequities throughout the United States.
32383432, The pandemic has spread across U.S. states, affecting different vulnerable populations, including both inner-city and rural populations, and those living in congregate settings such as nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.
32383432, In addition, since early April, there has been an increasing number of outbreaks of COVID-19 in jails and prisons.
32383432, We describe three overlapping epidemiologic waves of spread of COVID-19 linked to three different kinds of structural vulnerabilities.
32383409, Examination of shop social media websites and telephone calls to shops revealed that 61.4% (n = 54) have remained open, particularly within Korean/Asian and Hispanic/Latino ethnic locations (32 of the 54 shops).
32383409, Importantly, walk-in service was much higher within Hispanic/Latino locations compared to African American, Korean/Asian, or non-Hispanic White neighborhoods (p = 0.03).
32383409, It is not known if shops that stayed open were in direct violation of the order, didn't know all the details of the order, or found a loophole in the order and believed that they were an essential business.
32383409, Better communication between the vape shop industry and public health officials during this pandemic is needed.
32383269, We have also found that cell surface TLRs, especially TLR4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from SARS-CoV-2 to induce inflammatory responses.
32383269, The present study supported the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 from a bat and also revealed that TLR4 may have a crucial role in the virus-induced inflammatory consequences associated with COVID-19.
32383269, Therefore, selective targeting of TLR4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive TLR4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat COVID-19.
32383269, Finally, this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein, ACE2, or TLR-guided intervention strategy against COVID-19 shortly.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32383149,The COVID-19 outbreak is putting tremendous strain on the US healthcare system, with a direct impact on medical professionals, hospital systems, and physical resources.
32383149, While comprehensive public health and regulatory efforts are essential to overcome this crisis, it is important to recognize this moment as an opportunity to provide more intelligent and more efficient care in spite of increasing patient volumes and fewer resources.
32383149, Specifically, we must limit unnecessary and wasteful medical practices and improve the delivery of those services which enhance the quality of patient care.
32383149, In doing so, we will increase availability of the critical resources required for the provision of high-quality care to those in greatest need both now and in the future.

32382727, The causes of mental health effects in the context of COVID-19 are multifactorial and likely include biological, behavioral, and environmental determinants.
32382727, We argue that the COVID-19 crisis significantly threatens our basic human need for human connection, which might serve as a crucial environmental factor that could underlie the overall insult to our mental health.
32382727, Furthermore, "brain styles," which we have previously conceptualized as "biotypes" that are informed by a neural taxonomy, might interact with the universal threat to our need for human connection to explain the mental health consequences of COVID-19 from a precision psychiatry perspective.

32382315, Antibody-conjugated graphene sheets can rapidly detect targeted virus proteins and can be useful for large population screening, but also for the development of environmental sensors and filters, given the low cost of graphene materials.
32382315, The functionalized graphene has demonstrated a good viral capture capacity that, combined with heat or light-mediated inactivation, could be used as a disinfectant.
32382315, Graphene sensors arrays can be implemented on standard utility textiles and drug efficacy screening.
32382315, Thanks to its high versatility, we foresee that graphene may have a leading role in the fight against COVID-19.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32382249, This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure).
32382249, Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class.
32382249, Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32382161, These measures are expected to show short-term and long-term effects on people's working lives.
32382161, However, most media reports focused on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in work arrangements (e.g., short-time work, flexible location and hours) for workers in a regular employment relationship.
32382161, We here focus on workers in flexible employment relationships (e.g. temporary agency work and other forms of subcontracted labor, as well as new forms of working, such as in the gig economy).
32382161, Specifically, we will discuss (a) how the work and careers of individuals in flexible employment relationships might get affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) outline ideas how to examine period effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and careers of those individuals, and (c) outline how the pandemic can contribute to the ramification of flexible employment relationships.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

32380958, Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs.
32380958, It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood.
32380958, Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels.
32380958, Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males.Based on these observations we propose extracellular HMGB1 to be considered as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.
32380879, Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI).
32380879, The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated.In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety.
32380879, In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety.The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease.
32380879, Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.
32380869, Women reported barriers to protecting themselves given widespread unstable housing and complex health needs, though many tried to follow COVID-19 prevention recommendations.
32380869, Women expressed dissatisfaction with the suspension of research activities, as the pandemic contributed to a heightened need for study incentives, such as cash, emotional support, and other resources.
32380869, COVID-19 is illuminating disparities between those who can follow recommended actions to prevent infection and those who lack resources to do so.
32380869, Concerted efforts are required to reduce inequities that put the 1.3 million U.S. women under criminal justice supervision at risk for infection and mortality.
32380858, One option may be to deliver healthcare interventions remotely through digital healthcare solutions.
32380858, Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring together the evidence for remote healthcare during a quarantine situation period to support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation.The PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched using telehealth OR digital health OR mHealth OR eHealth OR mobile apps AND COVID-19 OR quarantine search terms.
32380858, We also searched for literature relating to cardiovascular disease AND quarantine.The literature search identified 45 potentially relevant publications, out of which nine articles were included.
32380858, Three overarching themes emerged from this review: (1) preparing the workforce and ensuring reimbursement for remote healthcare, (2) supporting mental and physical health and (3) supporting usual care.To support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation and to mitigate the effects of quarantine and adverse effect on mental and physical well-being, we should offer remote healthcare and provide access to their usual care.
32380846, Interventional radiology will continue to play an important role in patient care, during this crisis.
32380846, This document serves to guide interventional and general radiologists in safely performing IR procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, using the best evidence, guidelines and expert recommendations available.
32380846, These strategies include reviewing procedural indications, development of tactics to minimize cross contamination prior to the intervention, appropriate usage of personal protection equipment according to the type of procedure (along with defining aerosol-generating procedures in IR), along with developing the appropriate work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32380846, By adopting the policies described, hospitals will protect the interventional radiologists, medical radiation technologists, nurses, ancillary staff, along with patients who benefit from their care.
32380844, This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as "When is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?" or "How should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?" This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided.
32380844, Proposed reporting language is also outlined based on this structure.
32380844, As our understanding of this pandemic evolves, our appreciation for how imaging fits into the workup of patients during this unprecedented time evolves as well.
32380844, Although this consensus statement was written using the most recent literature, it is important to maintain an open mind as new information continues to surface.
32380453, There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.

32379999, Stratifying by age, a trend toward older ages was found in the desire for parenthood before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .05).Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on the desire for parenthood.
32379999, It is unknown whether these findings will result in a substantial modification of birth rate in the near future.
32379955, Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation).
32379955, In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32).
32379955, Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death.

32379923, COVID-19 mortality was also higher in countries where widespread BCG vaccination was discontinued more than 20 years ago and in countries that used the BCG Denmark strain regularly or temporarily.
32379923, This raises the question of whether BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 mortality are causally related.
32379923, An additional question is why different BCG strains may be variably associated with mortality.© 2020 The Author.

32379909,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic that is causing thousands of deaths worldwide.
32379909, The virus can be transmitted from person to person, directly or indirectly, via the respiratory, oro-fecal and probably sexual routes.1 The eventual vertical transmission route is still poorly explored.
32379909, However, mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the placenta probably does not occur, or likely occurs very rarely.2 All the studies conducted on COVID-19 pregnant women involved patients undergoing cesarean section, but the indications for such delivery modality were not clearly stated.This article is protected by copyright.

32379896,The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic.
32379896, There is, however, no confirmed anti-COVID-19 therapeutic currently.
32379896, In order to assist structure-based discovery efforts for repurposing drugs against this disease, we constructed knowledge-based models of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and compared the ligand molecules in the template structures with approved/experimental drugs and components of natural medicines.
32379896, Our theoretical models suggest several drugs, such as carfilzomib, sinefungin, tecadenoson, and trabodenoson, that could be further investigated for their potential for treating COVID-19.© 2020 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.
32379733, Ongoing traveler importation of SARS-CoV-2, attendance at professional and social events, introduction into facilities or settings prone to amplification, and challenges in virus detection all contributed to rapid acceleration of transmission during March.
32379733, Public health responses included intensive efforts to detect cases and trace contacts, and implementation of multiple community mitigation strategies.
32379733, Because most of the population remains susceptible to infection, recognition of factors associated with amplified spread during the early acceleration period will help inform future decisions as locations in the United States scale back some components of mitigation and strengthen systems to detect a potential transmission resurgence.
32379733, U.S. circulation of SARS-CoV-2 continues, and sustained efforts will be needed to prevent future spread within the United States.
32379723, Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
32379723, Furthermore, we established a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication).
32379723, Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section.
32379723, These reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models.
32379637, With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention.To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19.This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention.
32379637, The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores).After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test.
32379637, The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups.
32379637, SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups.Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.Published by Elsevier Ltd.
32379348, The vaccine construct was modeled, validated, and refined by different programs to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure.
32379348, The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B-cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response.
32379348, In silico cloning and codon adaptation were also performed with the pET-19b plasmid vector.

32379016,As the systems that people depend on are increasingly strained by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, public health impacts are manifesting in different ways beyond morbidity and mortality for elderly populations.
32379016, Loneliness is already a chief public health concern that is being made worse by COVID-19.
32379016, Agencies should recognize the prevalence of loneliness among elderly populations and the impacts that their interventions have on loneliness.
32379016, This letter describes several ways that loneliness can be addressed to build resilience for elderly populations as part of the public health response to COVID-19.
32379015, Everything is overwhelmed in the face of a rapid escalation of cases.
32379015, The countries that have already reported the peak of transmission are easing their preventive measures yet fearing a second wave of infection.
32379015, If the virus causes that next wave, are we sufficiently prepared to deal with it? I argue that the stakeholders concerned should simultaneously handle the ongoing pandemic while making effective preparations for its second wave.
32379015, To relax the preventive measures, countries must thoroughly revisit their situations based on scientific evidence.
32378503, Additional epidemiological data and related studies on COVID-19 infections in South Korea are likely to support or slightly modify this conclusion.
32378503, However, this study is significant in that it emphasizes the precautionary principle in preventing and managing infectious diseases, and has a suggestion for public health policies, which are currently in high demand.
32378460, Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people.
32378460, It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear.
32378460, The biopsychopharmacosocial model provides one method of assessing mental health and planning health and social care needs.
32378460, This article hopes to guide community health professionals through the specifics of this assessment model in relation to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.
32378459, Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses.
32378459, There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among these, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples.
32378459, This article aims to provide an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of nanoparticles as diagnostic or antiviral tools against coronaviruses.
32378459, The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors in this field are also presented.
32378180,The recent emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its resultant human disease, COVID-19, will likely have a significant impact on the corneal tissue donor pool.
32378180, Current recommendations from the United States and global eye bank associations call for the outright avoidance of tissues from donors recently infected with or exposed to COVID-19.
32378180, This conservative recommendation is currently appropriate given the reported ocular sequelae, tear film viral detectability, and transmissibility of COVID-19.
32378180, However, the rapidly increasing global prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 threatens the tenability of current tissue exclusion guidelines, and may necessitate their relaxation in the near future.
32377489, In light of rising concern about the current COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of universities across the world have either postponed or canceled all campus events such as workshops, conferences, sports, and other activities.
32377489, Universities are taking intensive measures to prevent and protect all students and staff members from the highly infectious disease.
32377489, Faculty members are already in the process of transitioning to online teaching platforms.

32377486, It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW).
32377486, Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW.
32377486, Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout.
32377486, The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.Copyright © 2020, Shah et al.
32377375, The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet.
32377375, Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32377375, Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge.

32376612, The ability to regulate individual tidal volumes using these breathing circuit modifications was tested both theoretically in computer simulations as well as experimentally in mechanical test lungs.In both the simulations and experimental measurements, naïve shared ventilation resulted in large imbalances across individual tidal volume delivery, dependent on imbalances across patient mechanical properties.
32376612, The proposed breathing circuit modifications for shared VCV and shared PCV enabled optimization of tidal volume distributions.
32376612, Individual tidal volume for one patient during shared VCV was sensitive to changes in the mechanical properties of other patients.
32376612, By contrast, shared PCV enabled independent control of individual patient received ventilation.Of the shared ventilation strategies considered, shared PCV, with the inclusion of in-line pressure relief valves in the individual inspiratory and expiratory limbs, offers the greatest degree of safety and lowest risk of catastrophic mechanical interactions between multiple patients connected to a single ventilator.Copyright © 2020 by Daedalus Enterprises.
32376580,To investigate the psychological status and sleep quality of nursing interns in collective isolation during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide evidence for adequate interventions.We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
32376580, Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality.The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (P < 0.05).
32376580, Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (r=0.508 and 0.546, respectively).
32376580, Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation.These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.
32376571, In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay.
32376571, We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples.With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively.
32376571, For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%. Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9998-1.000, P < 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation.Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 ℃ for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators.
32376571, Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.
32376535, The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days).
32376535, No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV.
32376535, The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic.SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus.
32376535, This finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus.
32376528, Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively.
32376528, The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students.
32376528, The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression.The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic.
32376528, Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.
32376208, Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR=1.76, IC95=[1.01-3.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR=2.31, IC95=[1.20-4.65]).

32375787, Iran is a developing country and its economic infrastructure has been hit hardly by embargo and sanctions.
32375787, While developed countries have allocated appropriate funding and are responding adequately to the COVID-19 pandemics, Iran has experienced a serious surge of cases and deaths and should strive to provide additional resources to the health system to make healthcare services more accessible and to increase the fairness of that access.
32375787, All relevant actors and stakeholders should work together to fight this disease.
32375574, The amino acids Asp269, Leu370, His374, and His345 were predicted as the key residues for lopinavir binding to human SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex while His378, Tyr515, Leu73, Leu100, Phe32 and Phe40 for remdesivir and Tyr510, Phe504, Met62, Tyr50, and His378 were predicted for azithromycin as the key residues for binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex.

32375487,Hospitals play a critical role in providing communities with essential medical care during all types of disaster.
32375487, Depending on their scope and nature, disasters can lead to a rapidly increasing service demand that can overwhelm the functional capacity and safety of hospitals and the healthcare system at large.
32375487, Planning during the community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is critical for maintaining healthcare services during our response.
32375487, This paper describes, besides general measures in times of a pandemic, also the necessary changes in the invasive diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with different entities of acute coronary syndromes including structural adaptations (networks, spokes and hub centres) and therapeutic adjustments.
32375455, In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread.We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes.
32375455, We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method.The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide.
32375455, Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June.We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in Korea.
32375455, Since the outbreak is expected to continue until May, non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term are required.
32375234, Associations between epidemiological parameters of the new case dynamics and temperature were examined using an ARIMA model. (3) Results: We show that, in the first stages of the epidemic, the velocity of contagion decreases with country- or region-wise temperature. (4) Conclusions: Results indicate that high temperatures diminish initial contagion rates, but seasonal temperature effects at later stages of the epidemy remain questionable.
32375234, Confinement policies and other eviction rules should account for climatological heterogeneities, in order to adapt the public health decisions to possible geographic or seasonal gradients.
32375067, Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will increase by 1.43-1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being controlled will be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in accordance with this situation.
32375067, In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic will be controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that in scenario two, and Egypt is in line with this prediction.
32375067, In the end, a series of epidemic controlling methods are proposed, including patient quarantine, close contact tracing, population movement control, government intervention, city and county epidemic risk level classification, and medical cooperation and the Chinese assistance.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32375025, Crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs interfere with receptor binding.
32375025, We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion.
32375025, These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32375002, LNPs formulated with C24 alkyl derivatives of cholesterol show a polymorphic shape and various degrees of multilamellarity and lipid partitioning, likely due to phase separation.
32375002, The addition of methyl and ethyl groups to the C24 alkyl tail of the cholesterol backbone induces multilamellarity (>50% increase compared to cholesterol), while the addition of a double bond induces lipid partitioning (>90% increase compared to cholesterol).
32375002, LNPs with multilamellar and faceted structures, as well as a lamellar lipid phase, showed higher gene transfection.
32375002, Unraveling the structure of mRNA-LNPs can enable their rational design toward enhanced gene delivery.
32374942, A customized Excel Data Tool was created, trialed across professional groups and made freely available for download at www.entintegrate.co.uk/entuk2wwtt, alongside a user guide, protocol, and registration link for the project.
32374942, Stakeholder support was obtained from national bodies.No remote consultations were refused by patients.
32374942, Preliminary data from 511 triaging episodes at 13 centers show that 77.1% of patients were discharged directly or have had their appointments deferred.Significant reduction in footfall can be achieved using a structured triaging system.

32374901, Herein, we present infection control measures that can be adopted in hospital settings that were executed in a Taiwanese hospital to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, including emergency preparedness and responses from the hospital administration, education, surveillance, patient flow arrangement, the partition of hospital zones, and the prevention of a systemic shutdown by using the "divided cabin, divided flow" strategy.
32374901, The measures implemented by a Taiwan hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic may not be universally applicable in every hospital.
32374901, Nonetheless, the presented infection control methods have been practically executed and can be referenced or modified to fit each hospital's unique condition.© 2020 The Authors.

32374894,The Covid-19 epidemic necessitates the application of strict isolation strategies to curb virus spreading.
32374894, Isolation of individuals in combination with fear of contagion, quarantine and stigma, as well as with potential (mis)information overload ("infodemic")1 , however, causes chronic stress and is associated with a burden on mental health, posing risk factors for anxiety and depression.
32374894, It is well understood that chronic stress is a major modulator of immunity2 and thus directly influences probability of infection.This article is protected by copyright.

32374545,The nasopharyngeal smear with PCR analysis is the first diagnostic test proposed to confirm infection with COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2.
32374545, However, its usefulness in emergency centers is limited due to its imperfect sensitivity (56-83 %), limited availability and the time required to obtain results.
32374545, For this reason, the chest CT-scan has been proposed as a rapid triage tool for diagnosis in these suspect Covid-19 patients.
32374545, However, its specificity is limited, exposing to the risk of over-diagnosis, and further data are needed to confirm its usefulness, and to highlight the possible prognostic value of the CT, in detecting early lesions associated with poor outcome, indicating the need for admission to intensive care.

32374416, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang)-type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), in fact, have been suggested to be avoided as they potentially upregulate ACE2 1 and, conversely, there are suggestions that ARBs might be beneficial 2 as SARS-CoV-2 causing ACE2 downregulation slows the Ang II conversion to the vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic Ang 1-7 3-5 , and the use of ARBs by blocking the excessive Ang II type-1 receptors activation, would be beneficial upregulating ACE2 activity and increasing Ang 1-7 levels.

32374218, Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl.
32374218, Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking.
32374218, Furthermore, recombination of an apha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely.
32374218, For recombination to happen, the 2 viruses would need to be present in the same cell of the same animal at the same time; a highly unlikely scenario as they cannot replicate in the same host!
32374024, We realize that the pandemic situation is very dynamic.
32374024, New data is published every day.
32374024, Despite the imposed limitations related to the necessity of social distancing, it is crucial to remember that providing optimal care in safe conditions should remain the primary goal of healthcare providers.
32374024, We plan to update the current guidelines as the situation develops.
32373996, The growing size of CoVID-19 in China for the next 210 days is estimated by predicting the expected confirmed and recovered cases.
32373996, The results revealed that weather conditions largely influence the spread of coronavirus in most of the Chinese provinces.
32373996, This study has determined that increasing temperature and short-wave radiation would positively increase the number of confirmed cases, mortality rate, and recovered cases.
32373996, The findings of this study agree with the results of our previous study.
32373995, Phylogenetics trees were then prepared using iTOL.Our study supports the notion that known artificial coronaviruses, including the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 synthesized in 2015, differ too much from SARS-CoV-2 to hypothesize an artificial origin of the latter.
32373995, On the contrary, our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins, before spreading to man.Speculations about the artificial origin of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely unfounded.
32373995, On the contrary, when carefully handled, engineered organisms provide a unique opportunity to study biological systems in a controlled fashion.
32373995, Biotechnology is a powerful tool to advance medical research and should not be abandoned because of irrational fears.
32373994, Owing to such concerns, antiviral strategies are being assessed based on host cell receptor targeting.
32373994, Many natural compounds with a tendency to strip off the cell surface receptors are under evaluation.
32373994, Compounds that are non-toxic, patient friendly, and yield a quick output are essential for the current scenario.
32373994, Drugs targeting the cell surface receptors should, therefore, be developed and standardized for the effective management of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.
32373721, Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype).
32373721, Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia.
32373721, LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals.
32373721, This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries.© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology.
32373409, Frequent hand washing implies a prolonged exposure to water and other chemical or physical agents and may induce several pathophysiologic changes, such as epidermal barrier disruption, impairment of keratinocytes, the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of the skin immune system, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.
32373409, Adverse dermatologic effects, such as excessive skin dryness or even contact dermatitis (particularly the irritant subtype and, to a lesser extent, the allergic subtype), can occur, especially in individuals with a history of atopic dermatitis.
32373409, These skin conditions are perfectly manageable, and applying a moisturizer immediately after washing hands or after using a portable hand sanitizer is the cornerstone in preventing the development of eczematous changes in the hands.
32373409, In the current global context, the potential occurrence of these dermatological adverse events should in no way cause people to deviate from strict hand hygiene rules.Copyright © 2020, Beiu et al.
32373339, A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (P < 0.05).
32373339, People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries.The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short.
32373339, The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.Copyright © 2020 by the Journal of Global Health.

32372892, The seven FCV-19S items had acceptable correlations with the test total (from .443 to .784).
32372892, Furthermore, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from .684 to .897).
32372892, The internal consistency was very good (α = .871).

32372877, The 2-6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory.
32372877, This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol.
32372877, The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a conventional N95 respirator.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32372755, Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak.
32372755, Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.
32371988, To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population.
32371988, One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that "Adults should engage in at least 150 minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk." During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented.
32371988, Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety.
32371988, Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.
32371560,Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19 thereby increasing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 like other procedures such as tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
32371560, Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients and patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

32371418, The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented particular challenges in caring for and managing this patient group.
32371418, The office of the chief medical officer (CMO) for England contacted the rheumatology community to provide expert advice on the identification of extremely vulnerable patients at very high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic who should be 'shielded'. This involves the patients being asked to strictly self-isolate for at least 12 weeks with additional funded support provided for them to remain at home.

32370986, Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies.
32370986, Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection.
32370986, In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

32370275, Doctors having institutional protocols for dealing with COVID-19 cases and those with sustained availability of PPE reported higher scores of preparedness (5.5 ± 2.3 and 6.2 ± 2.1 with p < 0.001, respectively).
32370275, Correlations with knowledge score, adherence to PPE score, and psychological impacts were investigated.
32370275, The study revealed multiple challenges and insufficiencies that can affect frontline doctors' preparedness.
32370275, Policy makers are urged to take these findings into consideration and to act promptly.
32370069, The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244-0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186-0.187 for AM.
32370069, The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings.
32370069, Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects.
32370069, The quantitative and qualitative results are different when GM and HM are used.
32370065, The algorithm-derived HCR reactions were validated with gel electrophoresis.
32370065, All proposed reactions exhibit a hybridization complex with a molecular mass >1.5k base pairs, which is clear evidence of chain reaction.
32370065, The hybridization efficiency trend revealed by gel electrophoresis corresponds nicely to the simulated data from the algorithm.
32370065, The HCR reactions and the corresponding algorithm serve as a basis to further SARS-CoV-2 sensing applications and facilitate better screening strategies for the prevention of on-going pandemics.
32369872, It is thought that COVID-19 may have both a direct and indirect effect on the cardiovascular system; however, the primary mechanism of underlying cardiovascular involvement is still uncertain.
32369872, Of particular interest is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is well known for its cardiovascular effects and is also considered to be important in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32369872, With a range of different drug candidates being suggested, effective anti-virals and vaccines are an area of on-going research.

32369770, Here, we summarize some of the diagnostic and management dilemmas for these patients, and we provide guidance on safe and as effective as possible delivery of care in the COVID-19 era.
32369770, We also attempt to address how pituitary services should be remodelled in the event of similar crises, while maintaining or even improving patient outcomes.
32369770, Regular review of these recommendations and further adjustments are needed, depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic status.
32369770, We consider that utilization of successful models of pituitary multidisciplinary care implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should continue after the crisis is over by using the valuable and exceptional experience gained during these challenging times.
32369759, The results suggest that there is a politicization of response recommendations.
32369759, Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78) compared to Republicans.This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

32369541, No study evaluated PPE reuse.
32369541, Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk.
32369541, Infection control training was associated with decreased risk.There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used.Health care workers experience significant burdens from coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2.
32369541, Use of PPE and infection control training are associated with decreased infection risk, and certain exposures are associated with increased risk.World Health Organization.
32369433, Conclusion: Clinicians' discomfort with shifting roles and obligations could pose implementation barriers for crisis standards of care.
32369240, We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
32369240, Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines.
32369240, During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris.
32369240, The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

32368894, At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 °C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment.
32368894, Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles.
32368894, However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators.
32368894, Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.
32368790,The recent spread of the Covid-19 infection has raised important questions within the haematology community on how best to manage and treat patients with haematological malignancies, particularly acute leukaemias.
32368790, Italy has witnessed a dramatic raise in infections and death rates, that has hit in particular certain areas of the most populated Northern regions of the country (Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna).
32368790, Within the nationwide Campus ALL programme in the last week of March we sent a questionnaire addressing different issues related to the management of adult ALL patients during the Covid-19 pandemic to 40 haematology centres located on the entire territory.This article is protected by copyright.

32368629, Approximately ⅓ of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious.
32368629, The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice.Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol.
32368629, Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted.

32367767, Also, a highly defined hit-list of seven compounds (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, Cryptoquindoline, 6-Oxoisoiguesterin, 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one, Cryptospirolepine, Isoiguesterin and 20-Epibryonolic acid) were identified.
32367767, Furthermore, four non-toxic, druggable plant derived alkaloids (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, and Cryptoquindoline) and terpenoids (6-Oxoisoiguesterin and 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one), that bind to the receptor-binding site and catalytic dyad of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were identified from the predictive ADME/tox and Lipinski filter analysis.
32367767, However, further experimental analyses are required for developing these possible leads into natural anti-COVID-19 therapeutic agents for combating the pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32367739, We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country.
32367739, Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak.
32367739, Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France.
32367739, Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.
32367683, From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19.There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64).
32367683, For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%).
32367683, The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs. 29.7%, p = .02).More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes.
32367683, Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32367579, Moreover, we propose that Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a lysosomal storage disorder, may provide new insights into potential future therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, by highlighting key established features of the disorder that together result in an "unfavorable" host cellular environment that may interfere with viral propagation.
32367579, Our reasoning evolves from previous biochemical and cell biology findings related to NPC, coupled with the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19.
32367579, Our overall aim is to suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting lysosomal function in general, and those particularly capable of reversibly inducing transient NPC-like cellular and biochemical phenotypes, constitute plausible mechanisms that could be used to therapeutically target COVID-19.© 2020 The Authors.

32367422, After follow-up CT examination on 35 patients, 21 cases turned better and 14 became worse.
32367422, There were signs of consolidation with marginal contraction, bronchiectasis, subpleural line, or fibrous streak.GGO and consolidation are the most common CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia, mainly with lobular distribution and subpleural distribution.
32367422, The main manifestations were tissue organization and fibrosis at late stage.
32367422, The most valuable features are the parallel pleura sign and the paving stone sign.• The CT signs of the COVID-19 pneumonia are mainly distributed in the lobular core, subpleural and diffused bilaterally. • The CT signs include the "parallel pleura sign," "paving stone sign," "halo sign," and "reversed halo sign." • During the follow-up, the distribution of lobular core, the fusion of lesions, and the organization changes at late stage will appear.
32367418, In the early rapid progressive stage (1~7 days), ground glass opacity (GGO) plus reticular pattern (58.1%), GGO plus consolidation (43.0%), and GGO (41.9%) were all common.
32367418, In the advanced stage (8~14 days), GGO plus consolidation (79.8%) and repairing CT signs (subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips) showed a significant increase (p < 0.05).
32367418, In the absorption stage, GGO plus consolidation (9.1%) sharply decreased (p < 0.05).CT imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia showed a predominantly peripheral, middle and lower, and posterior distribution.
32367418, The early rapid progressive stage is 1~7 days from symptom onset, the advanced stage with peak levels of abnormalities on CT is 8~14 days, and the abnormalities started to improve after 14 days.• The course of COVID-19 pneumonia consists of three stages: 1~7 days is the early rapid progressive stage, 8~14 days is the advanced stage, and after 14 days, the abnormalities started to decrease. • In the early rapid progressive stage, GGO plus a reticular pattern, GGO plus consolidation, and GGO were all common signs; in the advanced stage, signs of progression and absorption coexisted; lung abnormalities showed an asynchronous process with parts with absorption and parts progressing. • Lung abnormalities mainly showed predominantly peripheral, middle, and lower distribution.
32367319, Thoracic VCAR can generate a clear, fast and concise report that communicates vital medical information to referring physicians.
32367319, In the post-processing phase, software, thanks to the help of a colorimetric map, recognizes the ground glass and differentiates it from consolidation and quantifies them as a percentage with respect to the healthy parenchyma.
32367319, AI software therefore allows to accurately calculate the volume of each of these areas.
32367319, Therefore, keeping in mind that CT has high diagnostic sensitivity in identifying lesions, but not specific for Covid-19 and similar to other infectious viral diseases, it is mandatory to have an AI software that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one.
32366740, A concern was raised regarding the safety of ibuprofen use because of its role in increasing ACE2 levels within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system.
32366740, ACE2 is the coreceptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and so, a potential increased risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and/or worsening of COVID-19 infection was feared with ibuprofen use.
32366740, However, available data from limited studies show administration of recombinant ACE2 improves lung damage caused by respiratory viruses, suggesting ibuprofen use may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease.
32366740, At this time, there is no supporting evidence to discourage the use of ibuprofen.
32366695, This analysis enables mapping of the glycan-processing states across the trimeric viral spike.

32366172,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought to light significant health inequities that have existed in our society for decades.
32366172, Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and immigrants are the populations most likely to experience disparities related to burden of disease, health care, and health outcomes.
32366172, Increasingly, national and state statistics on COVID-19 report disproportionately higher mortality rates in blacks.
32366172, There has never been a more pressing time for us to enact progressive and far-reaching changes in social, economic, and political policies that will shape programs aimed at improving the health of all people living in the United States.
32366016, Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food.
32366016, Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values.
32366016, In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents' perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption.
32366016, However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations' future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations' food beliefs are more stable.
32365751, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics.
32365751, The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to the SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex.
32365751, These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition.
32365751, We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications for therapeutic strategies.
32365567, This review gives an overview of the field in general and the most notable developments of the last five years, in three parts: 1.
32365567, What can we detect? 2.
32365567, Which detection technologies are used in which setting? 3.
32365567, How do these techniques work? Finally, this review discusses potentials, shortfalls, and an outlook on future developments, especially in respect to the funding landscape and the field-application of these chips.
32365556, Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-γ also represses the inflammatory process.
32365556, Similarly, the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia.
32365556, In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-γ, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-γ activation.
32365556, Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-γ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.
32365354, Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying.
32365354, The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect.
32365354, The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April.
32365354, Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.
32365259, More innovative services should be developed to address the increasing demands for new approaches to deliver health care in the difficult times and to establish resilient health care systems for older people.

32364809, In response to the COVID-19 crisis, we developed a simple algorithm and strict guidelines to prioritize telemedicine specifically for inpatient dermatology consults.
32364809, This algorithm was quickly accepted by our hospital leadership and adopted by other inpatient consultative services.
32364809, In this Viewpoint, we share our experience with early adoption of teledermatology in the inpatient consultative setting in light of the COVID-19 crisis.
32364809, We also highlight the limitations, ethical considerations, and areas for future research with respect to the implementation of teledermatology.
32364041, The covalent docking showed that saquinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, delavirdine, cefuroxime axetil, oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies MMGBSA of -72.17, -72.02, -65.19, -57.65, -54.25, -51.8, and -51.14 kcal/mol, respectively.
32364041, The 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir, ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
32364041, The current study provides a powerful in silico results, means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in combined or sole therapy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32364011, We provide data on the potential covalent interaction of disulfiram and its metabolites with the substrate binding subsite of 3CLpro and propose a possible mechanism for the irreversible protease inactivation thought the reaction of the aforementioned compounds with the Cys145.
32364011, Although, captopril is shown to be a potential ligand of 3CLpro, it is not recommended anti-COVID-19 therapy, due to the fact that it can induce the expression of the viral cellular receptor such as, angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE-2, and thus, making the patient potentially more susceptible to infection.
32364011, On the other hand, disulfiram, an alcoholism-averting drug, has been previously proposed as an antimicrobial and anti-SARS and MERS agent, safe to use even at higher doses with low side effects, it is recommended to be tested for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32363255, The results show that the 17 organosulfur compounds, accounting for 99.4% contents of the garlic essential oil, have strong interactions with the amino acids of the ACE2 protein and the main protease PDB6LU7 of SARS-CoV-2.
32363255, The strongest anticoronavirus activity is expressed in allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, which account for the highest content in the garlic essential oil (51.3%).
32363255, Interestingly, docking results indicate the synergistic interactions of the 17 substances, which exhibit good inhibition of the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins.

32362646, Additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qRT-PCR machines, leveraging spare capacity on available qRT-PCR machines not drafted into COVID-19 testing, to in-laboratory process optimization efforts.Moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day.
32362646, The capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qRT-PCR and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based machines available with the Multidisciplinary Research Units (MRUs), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP).
32362646, Using combination/multiplex kits, and provision of automated RNA extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times.Adopting these interventions could help increase public sector's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day.
32362646, It is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce, procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts.
32362642, This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India.
32362642, Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts.
32362642, The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats.
32362642, The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.
32362583, An online survey comprising 20 questions regarding EP&R and Operations management was developed using the Qualtrics® survey software and administered to a sample of PPs.

32361927, With regard to the specific surgical procedures, nearly all primary TJA were cancelled (92.6%) as well as aseptic revisions (94.7%).
32361927, In most hospitals, periprosthetic fractures (87.2%), hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and septic revisions for acute infections (75.8%) were still being performed.During the current 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing a near-total shutdown of TJA.
32361927, A massive cutback was observed for primary TJA and revision TJA, even in massively failed TJA with collapse, dislocation, component failure or imminent dislocation.
32361927, Only life-threatening pathologies like periprosthetic fractures and acute septic TJA are currently undergoing surgical treatment.V.
32361911, We also found that ACE2 positive cells had high expressions of stress response and immune activation-related genes.
32361911, Interestingly, some potential SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes such as TMPRSS2, BSG, CTSL and CTSB had different expression patterns in the same cell type.
32361911, Furthermore, ACE2 expression level in NOA donors' Sertoli cells was significantly decreased.

32361706, In the crisis and immediate recovery phase of disasters, the focus should be on making survivors feel safe and giving them assistance in decreasing their anxiety by addressing their basic needs and welfare.
32361706, So, it is critical that governmental institutions, business, and non-profit organizations proactively find mechanisms to work collaboratively and share resources.
32361706, Special attention and extra resources must be directed towards vulnerable and marginalized populations.
32361706, In this editorial we share lessons learned from experiencing disproportionate impact of health crisis and advocate for the notion that recovery efforts must address trauma at individual, interpersonal and community levels, and be based in a healing justice framework.
32361692, The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays an important role in viral attachment, fusion and entry.
32361692, However, other structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins are potential influencers in virus pathogenicity.
32361692, Among these proteins; Orf3, Orf8, and Orf10 show the least homology to SARSCoV proteins and therefore should be further studied for their abilities to modulate antiviral and inflammatory responses.
32361692, Here, we discuss how SARS-COV-2 interacts with our immune system.
32361635, Vascular complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative.

32361598, In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters.
32361598, The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C-25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments.
32361598, The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32360608, The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the "exposure time" to the "interaction time" (virus-cells).
32360608, This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period.The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired.
32360608, This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV.
32360608, Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available.
32360608, The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework.A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript.

32360580, Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
32360580, The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
32360580, Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32359226, Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists.
32359226, Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure.
32359226, As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.
32359226, KEY POINTS: · Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic urged development of guidelines.. · Neonatal COVID-19 disease is uncommon.. · Respiratory outcomes in neonates seems favorable.. · Current neonatal respiratory care should continue.. · Clinicians should watch frequently for updates..Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.
32359223, Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered.
32359223, Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles.
32359223, Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management.This paper evaluates the issues surrounding these challenges including the OR environment and AGPs which are germane to surgical practices around the world.

32358952,The first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Dominican Republic coincided with a period of political crisis.
32358952, Distrust in governmental institutions shaped the critical phase of early response.
32358952, Having a weak public health infrastructure and a lack of public trust, the Ministry of Health (MoH) began the fight against COVID-19 with a losing streak.
32358952, Within 45 days of the first reported case, the political crisis and turmoil caused by "fake news" are limiting the capacity and success of the MoH response to the pandemic.
32358884, The first scenario predicts an increase in consumption for some populations, particularly men, due to distress experienced as a result of the pandemic.
32358884, A second scenario predicts the opposite outcome, a lowered level of consumption, based on the decreased physical and financial availability of alcohol.
32358884, With the current restrictions on alcohol availability, it is postulated that, for the immediate future, the predominant scenario will likely be the second, while the distress experienced in the first may become more relevant in the medium- and longer-term future.
32358884, Monitoring consumption levels both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic will be necessary to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on different groups, as well as to distinguish them from those arising from existing alcohol control policies.© 2020 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.
32358880,With the arrival of the coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States, care practice paradigms have drastically changed.
32358880, Data from China suggest that the new virus poses additional risks as case fatality of patients with cancer was higher at 5.6% compared to 2.3% of the general population.
32358880, There are three proposed major strategies to address care for patients with cancer in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with postponing treatment for those with stable cancer, increasing personal protection provisions for patients with cancer, and increasing monitoring if a patient becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32358880, In this present commentary, we discuss the unique mental health challenges and burdens of patients with head and neck cancer in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and approaches to mitigate these stressors through telemedicine to reduce future burdens to the patient and the health care system.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32358813,Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 start to get increasingly described [1-3]. However, the link of causality remains uncertain.
32358813, Reports of chilblains-like lesions circulate on social medias and have appeared in the literature [4,5]. Google Trends (GT) provides data on the relative search volumes (RSV) of queries and topics over time and across geographical areas (https://trends.google.com/trends/).
32358813, It allows seasonal and long-term assessment of trends in public interest, including during COVID-19 outbreak [6,7].

32358234, The threat of COVID-19 is particularly serious as there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy.
32358234, Further complications are introduced by shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients and effective testing to identify infected patients, raising the need for delaying some testing and therapies.
32358234, Certain vulnerable segments of the general population have been identified (advanced age and certain comorbidities), which should heighten further their preventive efforts.
32358234, Therefore, this guidance is intended to be operationalized depending on a facility's specific needs and local disease prevalence.
32358057, There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the "gold-standard" CDC RT-PCR test.
32358057, Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles.
32358057, Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own labs.
32358057, We hope that this review can urgently consolidate and disseminate information to aid researchers in designing and implementing optimized COVID-19 testing protocols to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.
32357977, The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented particular challenges in caring for and managing this patient group.
32357977, The office of the chief medical officer (CMO) for England contacted the rheumatology community to provide expert advice on the identification of extremely vulnerable patients at very high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic who should be 'shielded'. This involves the patients being asked to strictly self-isolate for at least 12 weeks with additional funded support provided for them to remain at home.
32357977, A group of rheumatologists (the authors) have devised a pragmatic guide to identifying the very highest risk group using a rapidly developed scoring system which went live simultaneous with the Government announcement on shielding and was cascaded to all rheumatologists working in England.© Royal College of Physicians 2020.

32357675, We found that besides the social distancing of individuals, of well known relevance, the strategy of identifying and isolating infected individuals in a large daily rate can help to flatten the power-laws.
32357675, These are the essential strategies followed in the Republic of Korea.
32357675, The high correlation between the power-law curves of different countries strongly indicates that the government containment measures can be applied with success around the whole world.
32357675, These measures are scathing and to be applied as soon as possible.
32357655, Surprisingly, under some circumstances, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures-branches and leaves of a tree.
32357655, Results also show that new communities will absorb a link resource to weaken the degree growth of hub nodes.
32357655, Our models have a common explanation for the community of regular and tree-like networks and also breaks the tyranny of the early adopter; unlike the standard popularity principle, newer nodes and communities will come to dominance over time.
32357655, Importantly, our model can fit well with the construction of the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network.
32357582, Second, also in Italy, like in China, the older adults are at higher risk in being infected with COVID-19 and if they get ill, they have a higher risk of death.
32357582, The balance previously achieved between age-related disorders and a good quality of life and good health is now under high pressure.
32357582, It is very important to protect elderly people from infection, but also it is important to respect them and to support them in this complex situation.
32357582, There is a great risk of "ageism". In agreement with Lloyd-Sherlock and colleagues (2020), in this editorial we propose some hints of analysis, starting from the ongoing experience in Italy.
32357553, EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19.
32357553, EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects.
32357553, More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production.
32357553, Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat.
32357545, The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine development.
32357545, As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported.
32357545, Using the epitope information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants which might cause drifts.
32357545, Among such variants, 23403A>G variant (p.D614G) in spike protein B-cell epitope is observed frequently in European countries, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France, but seldom observed in China.
32357471, However, CoVs such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the newest SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) lead to severe and deadly diseases with mortality rates ranging between ~1 to 35% depending on factors such as age and pre-existing conditions.
32357471, Despite continuous global health threats to humans, there are no approved vaccines or drugs targeting human CoVs, and the recent outbreak of COVID-19 emphasizes an urgent need for therapeutic interventions.
32357471, Using computational and bioinformatics tools, here we present the feasibility of reported broad-spectrum RNA polymerase inhibitors as anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs targeting its main RNA polymerase, suggesting that investigational and approved nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitors have potential as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
32357471, However, we note that it is also possible for SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and acquire drug resistance mutations against these nucleoside inhibitors.
32357424, Our digital support package on 'psychological wellbeing for healthcare workers' is free to use, has been positively evaluated and was highly accessed within one week of release.
32357424, It is available here: Supplementary Materials.
32357424, This package was deemed to be appropriate, meaningful and useful for the needs of UK healthcare workers.
32357424, We recommend provision of this e-package to healthcare workers alongside wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
32357380, Surgeons were least likely to be concerned for their own health and safety and had the greatest concern for their resident trainees.This study highlights differences in the willingness of head and neck surgeons to delay surgery or alter plans during times when hospital resources are scarce and risk is high.

32357084, In addition, 2 patients (3%) were seen in clinic for acute needs and 38 (60%) were seen by the multidisciplinary team through telemedicine.Conclusions:In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a telemedicine clinic process that serves the needs of a multidisciplinary care team is paramount to preserving the CF care model.
32357084, Through a systematic design and test process, a feasible and sustainable program was created that can be utilized by other multidisciplinary programs to adapt to their context.
32356908, This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients.
32356908, Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications.
32356908, Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients.

32356760, CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up.
32356760, The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored.
32356760, Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19.
32356760, In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.
32356672, However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable.
32356672, Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure.
32356672, In view of the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus), lung point-of-care ultrasound (Lu-PoCUS) is a still underutilized valuable alternative, especially when using pocket devices.
32356672, In this review the current value and role of stethoscope, pulsoxymetry, chest x ray, lung computer tomography and lung point-of-care ultrasound will be determined based on the available literature.
32356628, A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.Among 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.
32356628, A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.
32356628, There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.
32356628, None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.We found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.
32356577, We enrolled 1193 PsO patients treated with biologics and small molecules and we used the entire Lombardia population as controls.
32356577, Notably, 17 PsO patients COVID-19 confirmed were quarantined at home and five hospitalized, no PsO patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or died.
32356577, With respect to the general population of Lombardy, patients on biologics were at higher risk to test positive for COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.25-5.73], P < .0001), to be self-quarantined at home (OR 9.05 [95% CI 5.61-14.61], P < .0001) and hospitalized (OR 3.59 [95% CI 1.49-8.63], P = .0044), however, not increased risk of ICU admission or death were found.

32356382, Cutaneous adverse reactions can develop that need to be prevented, identified and therapeutically managed.
32356382, According to the data reported by Lin et al 1 , based in the experience from healthcare workers in Wuhan, adverse skin reactions were reported in 74% of responders (n=376) to a general survey.
32356382, The most commonly reported types of eruptions were skin dryness or desquamation (68.6%), papules or erythema (60.4%) and maceration (52,9%).This article is protected by copyright.

32356252, Nucleic acid vaccines may introduce mutations into the human genome.
32356252, ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen have been suggested to exacerbate the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32356252, Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.
32355904, Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17-45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34-58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics.
32355904, Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9-18%).
32355904, Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic.
32355904, The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.© 2020 The Authors.
32355837, With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
32355837, Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.
32355837, Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

32355658,Face shields are personal protective equipment devices that are to be used by many health care workers during COVID 19 pandemic for protection of the facial area and associated mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) from droplet spread of infection.
32355658, Face shields are generally not used alone, but in conjunction with other protective equipment like cap, mask, goggle, and are therefore classified as adjunctive personal protective equipment.
32355658, In the wake of scarcity of face shields during the COVID 19 Pandemic, consideration of innovating newer methods of manufacturing must be considered to overcome the present day scarcity without jeopardising the safety of front line Heath care workers.
32355658, All initial fast innovations comes with advantages and disadvantages, hence we thought of putting down simple guidelines for new emerged face shield use.© Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.
32355547, If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city.
32355547, However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend.
32355547, The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models.This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing.

32355450, At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students.
32355450, However, treatment group students who spent more time using mobile devices to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spent minimal time.
32355450, This finding re-established the importance of guided activities as intervention to facilitate students' learning and points to the need for curricular modernization and faculty development in the instructional use of technology.
32355450, Due to the increased need for online instruction precipitated by "social distancing and isolation' required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, the need for faculty to acquire skills in guided use of mobile devices for school-related learning is anticipated to be greater than ever.© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.
32355435, We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases).
32355435, By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic.
32355435, Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32355114, Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy.
32355114, The patients were diagnosed with germicidal-range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity.
32355114, Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection.Although SARS-CoV-2 is structurally akin to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and previous studies demonstrated high levels of inactivation of beta-coronavirus with germicidal-range UV, evidence for its efficacy to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is lacking.
32355114, This case report serves to emphasize the potential consequences of phototoxicity from improper use of UV germicidal lamps for household disinfection as well as to highlight the fact that UV germicidal lamps currently have no established role in household disinfection of SARS-CoV-2.

32354369, The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages.
32354369, Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes.
32354369, We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration.
32354369, The patient was cured and discharged.This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.
32354113, Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile.
32354113, This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32354113, In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs.
32354113, The applications of nanochemistry and general nanotechnology was also discussed to give the status of nanodiagnostic systems for COVID-19.
32353978, In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins showed major differences in both shape and size, indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile.
32353978, Furthermore, analysis of the binding site's conformational changes during the simulation time indicated its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design.
32353978, Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicated that the virus' mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors.
32353978, However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.

32352933, However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097).CONCLUSIONAll populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk.
32352933, Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia.
32352933, It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible.FUNDINGThis work was supported by National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (no. 2017ZX10103005-007) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2018YFE0204500).
32352850, COVID-19 outbreaks have already been identified in New York City and Cook County, Illinois, jails, with infection rates at the Rikers Island jail complex far exceeding community rates.
32352850, In response, correctional systems are implementing changes to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including reducing jail and prison admissions and releasing people from facilities.

32352537,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of life in the United States and around the globe, including significant impacts to higher education, both in its teaching-learning and research missions.
32352537, With the physical closure of so many college and university campuses, a looming challenge is how nurse researchers can continue to generate new knowledge during a temporary but extended period of social distancing where conducting research requiring physical interaction with participants is impossible.
32352537, In this Methodology Corner installment, a brief overview of secondary data analysis is provided, and resources for locating potentially useful data are described.

32352359,Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic remitting-relapsing autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems.
32352359, In this article we discuss aspects in the management of lupus patients that are particularly relevant during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32352359, We speculate that lupus patients might be more susceptible for a more severe COVID-19 disease course and emphasize the importance of maintaining remission in lupus patients.
32352359, We discuss the critical role hydroxychloroquine plays in the management of lupus patients and suggest considering the psychosocial implications of the current pandemic on lupus care.
32352309, CONCLUSION.
32352309, We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32352309, In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.

32351056, The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups.
32351056, By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3.
32351056, The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019.
32351056, Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.
32350857, The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak.
32350857, Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic.

32350773, Some reported challenges in accessing HIV testing, prevention and treatment services.
32350773, Compared to older MSM, those 15-24 years were more likely to report economic and service impacts.
32350773, While additional studies of COVID-19 epidemiology among MSM are needed, there is already evidence of emerging interruptions to HIV-related services.
32350773, Scalable remote solutions such as telehealth and mailed testing and prevention supplies may be urgently needed to avert increased HIV incidence among MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic era.
32350571, The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population.
32350571, In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship.
32350571, In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover.
32350571, If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population.
32350543, Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly.
32350543, Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit.
32350543, Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic.
32350543, Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.
32349962, The network synergizes a newly established 5G service, a smartphone app, and an existing telemedicine system.
32349962, Telemedicine was demonstrated to be feasible, acceptable, and effective in Western China, and allowed for significant improvements in health care outcomes.

32349382, IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution.
32349382, The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating.
32349382, This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate's health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging.
32349382, Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.
32349259, The R0 value is decreased in Lombardy and the Northern regions, while it is increased in Central and Southern regions.
32349259, The expected peak of the SEIR model is set at the end of March, at a national level, with Southern Italian regions reaching the peak in the first days of April.
32349259, Regarding the strengths and limitations of this study, our model is based on assumptions that might not exactly correspond to the evolution of the epidemic.
32349259, What we know about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is based on Chinese data that seems to be different than those from Italy; Lombardy is experiencing an evolution of the epidemic that seems unique inside Italy and Europe, probably due to demographic and environmental factors.
32349121, Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
32349121, CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations.
32349121, The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold.
32349121, Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9-11.
32349120, Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across all of China.
32349120, Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage.
32349120, Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations.
32349120, This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.
32349113, We also endeavor to answer the key frequently asked questions in areas of the coronaviruses, COVID-19, disease transmission, personal protection, mask selection, and special measures in ophthalmic practices.
32349113, COVID-19 is highly infectious and could be life-threatening.
32349113, Using our protocol and measures, we have achieved zero infection in our ophthalmic practices in Hong Kong and China.
32349113, Preventing spread of COVID-19 is possible and achievable.
32349032, Radiographic technologies and tools, including Computed tomography (CT) and Chest X-ray (CXR), were applied for initial screening and follow-up, from which provides detail diagnosis with specific pathologic features for staging and treatment arrangement.
32349032, Although the radiographic imaging is found less sensitive, numerous CT-positive patients were not screened out by RT-PCR initially and later confirmed as COVID-19 positive.
32349032, Besides, the shortage of sampling kits and the longer turn-over time of PCR examinations in some areas were noticed due to logistic issues and healthcare burden.
32349032, In this review, we will discuss the challenges and the future perspectives of using radiographic modalities for COVID-19 diagnosis in view of securing human lives amid the crisis.
32349031, It's reported that the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to be angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2).
32349031, Notably, whether the ACE-related inhibitors or drugs modulated ACE2 activity in affecting with viral activity and disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 is still an open question.
32349031, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP-4), a well-known anti-diabetic drug, has been widely used to control the glycemic condition in diabetic patients.
32349031, In this article, we are focusing on the impact of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and DPP4 inhibitors used on SARS-CoV-2 activity and discussions about those drugs that may be related to infectious condition of COVID-19 diseases.
32348946, The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China's energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution.
32348946, The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment.
32348946, These findings can provide a reference for other countries to assess the influence of COVID-19 on the environment.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32348627, As physicians working in a multidisciplinary centre for the cure of Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) in a country (Italy) that has been severely affected by COVID-19, we are surprised that, among this impressive amount of publications, there is none on HHT.
32348627, Indeed, we performed our last PubMed search on 22 April 2020, using the keywords "Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia" OR "Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia" OR "HHT" OR "Rendu-Osler-Weber" AND "COVID-19" OR "coronavirus", and found no papers.
32348627, This is surprising, because, although HHT is a rare disease, there are many reasons why we believe that it deserves special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.This article is protected by copyright.

32348598, IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.
32348598, Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.
32348598, If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked.IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

32348474, Krichel and coauthors in their article in the Biochemical Journal provide molecular details of how the viral polyprotein (nsp7-10) produced from the positive single stranded RNA genome, is cleaved to form proteins that are part of the replication/transcription complex.
32348474, The authors highlight the impact the polyprotein conformation has on the cleavage efficiency of the main protease (Mpro) and hence the order of release of non-structural proteins 7-10 (nsp7-10) of the SARS-CoV.
32348474, Cleavage order is important in controlling viral processes and seems to have relevance in terms of the protein-protein complexes formed.

32348380, The internet search-interest of COVID-19-related terms was obtained using Google Trends.
32348380, The Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict trends, respectively.There were 636,282 new cases and,325 deaths of COVID-19 in the USA from March 1 to April 15, 2020, with a crude mortality of 4.45%. The daily new cases peaked at 35,098 cases on April 10, 2020 and the daily deaths peaked at 2,494 on April 15, 2020.
32348380, The search interest of COVID, "COVID pneumonia" and "COVID heart" were correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence, with 12 or 14 days of delay (Pearson's r = 0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19 days of delay (Pearson's r = 0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively).
32348380, The 7-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed no significant correlations of the observed data with the predicted daily new cases or daily deaths, using search interest of COVID, COVID heart, and COVID pneumonia.Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA.
32348293, Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought.This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures.

32348165, Insufficient attention has been given to challenges, lessons learned, and potential solutions to support and sustain vaccine industry engagement in vaccine development for EIDs.
32348165, Drawing from lessons from the most recent Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the 2009 H1N1 influenza, 2014-2016 Ebola, and 2015-16 Zika outbreaks preceding it, we offer our perspective on challenges facing EID vaccine development and recommend additional solutions to prioritize in the near term.
32348165, The 6 recommendations focus on reducing vaccine development timelines and increasing business certainty to reduce risks for companies.
32348165, The global health security community has an opportunity to build on the current momentum to design a sustainable model for EID vaccines.
32348054,Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Confederation has referred to « vulnerable populations » over the age of 65 and/or with co-morbidities as potentially at risk.
32348054, This group should not overshadow other highly vulnerable populations such as forced migrants, people deprived of their liberty, and the homeless.
32348054, In the context of the current pandemic, there is a risk of increasing inequities in care among these populations.
32348054, In this practical article, we list the marginalized and disadvantaged left behind populations in the canton of Vaud and the issues of inequities in care in the context of the pandemic; we also present the implementation of procedures sometimes original, always inter-professional and interdisciplinary, specifying who the partners are and what the resources are for front-line caregivers.
32348046, Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities.
32348046, However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations.
32348046, Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic.
32348046, In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
32348043, This article compiles recommendations fr om cancer societies and expert opinions to provide guidance and practical solutions for the oncology clinic.
32348043, We propose that optimal standards of care be upheld, and short-term safety concerns due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 be weighed against a long-term compromise in cancer prognosis when deciding on adjustments in cancer care.
32348043, Proper mitigation strategies in the clinic and use of less resource-heavy but equivalent treatment alternatives often allow optimal cancer care.
32348043, The magnitude of benefit of cancer treatments needs to be systematically considered.
32347991, Once the metal frame set in place, it is wrapped with a single-use clear and sterile cover for surgical C-arm.
32347991, This installation is simple, easy, and fast to achieve and can be carried out with inexpensive material available in every hospital.

32347745,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has and continues to put huge pressure on intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.
32347745, Many patients with COVID-19 require some form of respiratory support and often have prolonged ICU stays, which results in a critical shortage of ICU beds.
32347745, It is therefore not always physically possible to treat all the patients who require intensive care, raising major ethical dilemmas related to which patients should benefit from the limited resources and which should not.
32347745, Here we consider some of the approaches to the acute shortages seen during this and other epidemics, including some guidelines for triaging ICU admissions and treatments.
32347743, Conclusions - In the largest reported cohort of COVID-19 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine {plus minus} azithromycin, no instances of TdP or arrhythmogenic death were reported.
32347743, Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy.
32347743, Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.
32347612, Several steps like increasing the working hours of outpatient clinics, posting dermatologists and health staffs in shifts, encouraging online registration and payment, providing time slots to patients should be taken to prevent overcrowding at outpatient departments in hospitals of developing countries like India where the usual patient turnover during summers maybe around 600 to 800 per day.
32347612, Once diagnosed by the dermatologist, a subsequent meticulous use of teledermatology can limit the number of follow-up visits.
32347612, To avoid student gatherings, the undergraduate and postgraduate teaching schedule should be replaced by online or virtual teaching in form of webinars and video conferencing.
32347612, Above all, intense upgradation of health care infrastructure, recruitment, training of new health care staffs on mass level and huge investment in health care sector is required in all the developing countries.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
32347204, Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test.ConclusionUsing IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies.
32347198, The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement.
32347198, Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.
32347112, The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
32347112, The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
32347112, In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
32347112, Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
32347055, Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses.
32347055, These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug.
32347055, At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases.
32347055, In view of this, we describe the effects of CypA on the replication of coronaviruses and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors, which will provide the scientific basis and ideas for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.
32346790, Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT.
32346790, Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature.We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients.
32346790, Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories.
32346790, Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19.The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.• Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. • The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
32346664, The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible.
32346664, We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China.
32346664, We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases.
32346664, We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic..
32346656, The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s.
32346656, The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels.Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures.
32346656, This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.© 2020 The Author(s).

32346394,Cancer patients in conflict settings experience significant barriers in accessing chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as palliative care and psychosocial support.
32346394, Now they face an additional possible risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus and the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on movement restrictions and their access to care.
32346394, In this commentary, we highlight that despite the low COVID-19 burden in conflict settings like Gaza, COVID-19 could lead to further inequity in cancer care and poorer outcomes for Palestinians with cancer.
32346394, This is due to the pre-existing shortage in cancer resources as well as the lack of context-specific guidelines to prepare for COVID-19 in war-torn settings.© the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.
32346359, An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors.
32346359, In this study, we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic.
32346359, Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically relevant variables.
32346359, We discuss these data in relation to the potentially functional nature of fear in global health crises.© The Author(s) 2020.
32346206, The third area of scholarship we highlight is that which seeks to amplify the meaning of abortion as a social good.
32346206, Much abortion scholarship is attuned to a critique of negative aspects of abortion-from its representation in popular culture to restrictive law and access issues.
32346206, This is critical work but/and the performative nature of abortion scholarship, like all discourse, means that it can amplify the association of negativity with abortion.

32345860, During the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, most hospitals have postponed elective surgeries.
32345860, However, some emergency surgeries especially for trauma patients are inevitable.
32345860, For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, a standard protocol addressing preoperative preparation, intraoperative management and postoperative surveillance should be implemented to avoid nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of patients and the healthcare workforce.
32345860, With reference to the guidelines and recommendations issued by the National Health Commission and Chinese Society of Anesthesiology, this article provides recommendations for anesthesia management of trauma and emergency surgery cases during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32345741, Differences in VT, EELV, and imputed pH were recorded.Depending on differences in resistance and compliance, differences in VT ranged from 1% (with equal resistance and compliance) to 79%. Differences in EELV ranged from 2% to 109%, whereas differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive VT (ie, > 8 mL/kg) did not occur, but failure due to excessive EELV difference (ie, > 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs.
32345741, There was no difference in failure rate between volume control and pressure control ventilation modes.These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation.
32345741, Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the 2 patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP.
32345741, We provide suggestions for solving these problems.Copyright © 2020 by Daedalus Enterprises.
32345566, We must first ensure the safety of our patients and surgical staff.
32345566, It must be a priority to monitor the availability of supplies for the continued care of patients suffering from COVID-19.
32345566, As we resume elective orthopedic surgery and total joint arthroplasty, we must begin to reduce expenses by renegotiating vendor contracts, use ambulatory surgery centers and hospital outpatient departments in a safe and effective manner, adhere to strict evidence-based and COVID-19-adjusted practices, and incorporate telemedicine and other technology platforms when feasible for health care systems and orthopedic groups to survive economically.The return to normalcy will be slow and may be different than what we are accustomed to, but we must work together to plan a transition to a more sustainable health care reality which accommodates a COVID-19 world.Our goal should be using these lessons to achieve a healthy and successful 2021 fiscal year.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32345485, The immediate use of convalescent plasma provides prompt availability of a promising treatment while specific vaccines and treatments are evaluated and brought to scale.
32345485, Further development of improved convalescent plasma, vaccines and other therapeutics depends on quick generation of additional data on pathogenesis and immune response.
32345485, Additionally, given the lack of information around the natural history of this disease, PRT should be considered to add a layer of safety to protect recipients of convalescent plasma.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32345392,With concerns for presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 and increasing burden of contact tracing and employee furloughs, several hospitals have supplemented pre-existing infection prevention measures with universal masking of all personnel in hospitals.
32345392, Other hospitals are currently faced with the dilemma of whether or not to proceed with universal masking in a time of critical mask shortages.
32345392, We summarize the rationale behind a universal masking policy in healthcare settings, important considerations before implementing such a policy and the challenges with universal masking.
32345392, We also discusses proposed solutions such as universal face shields.
32345362, In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females.
32345362, In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively.Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally.
32345362, The different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity.
32345362, This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32345140, Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex.
32345140, Based on the results, we report that stilbene based compounds in general and resveratrol, in particular, can be promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike protein.
32345140, Our findings in this study are promising and call for further in vitro and in vivo testing of stiblenoids, especially resveratrol against the COVID-19. [Formula: see text] Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
32345140, SarmaHighlightsStilbenoid analogs could be potential disruptors of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex.In particular, resveratrol revealed highly stable conformation to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex.The strong interaction of resveratrol is affirmed by molecular dynamic simulation studies and better net free energies.
32344993, Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and difficulties of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists face various challenges on how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of infection.
32344993, It is less than six months since the identification of the original COVID-19 case on New Year's Eve 2019, so it is still too early to fully understand the natural history of COVID-19 and the evidence on COVID-19-related PD is scant.
32344993, Though the possibilities presented are speculative, they are theory-based, and supported by prior evidence from other neurotrophic viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
32344993, Neurologists should be on high alert and vigilant for potential acute and chronic complications when encountering PD patients who are suspected of having COVID-19.
32344657, Mental fatigue should be anticipated and mental controlled.
32344657, Adequate methods of recovery should be provided.

32344657, This is an ideal situation in which to rethink personal life, understanding the situation, that can be promoted in these difficult times that affect practically the whole world.
32344568, The only reliable test in current use for testing acute infection targets the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and the most widely used method is quantitative fluorescence-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
32344568, Despite its ubiquity, there is a significant amount of uncertainty about how this test works, potential throughput and reliability.
32344568, This has resulted in widespread misrepresentation of the problems faced using this test during the current COVID-19 epidemic.
32344568, This primer provides simple, straightforward and impartial information about RT-qPCR.
32344438, The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively.
32344438, Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale.
32344438, We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system.

32343650, All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths.
32343650, The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period.Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period.Despite the inherent uncertainty, it is safe to assume an observed excess mortality of 2400 to 4000 deaths.
32343650, Excess mortality was associated with older age groups (over age 65).The data suggests a ternary explanation for early excess mortality: COVID-19, non-identified COVID-19 and decrease in access to healthcare.
32343650, The estimates have implications in terms of communication of non-pharmaceutical actions, for research, and to healthcare professionals.The excess mortality occurred between March 1 and April 22 was 3 to 5 fold higher than what can be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths.
32343429, Our study should encourage researchers to conduct trial evaluating Anti IL-6 antibodies such as Tocilizumab to assess the efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19.

32342516,Dental institutions in the United States are reeling from the consequences of the novel SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, the causative agent of CODIV-19.
32342516, As oral health care providers, we have been trained on prevention of aerosol transmissible diseases, but we are still grappling with many unknown factors regarding COVID-19.
32342516, While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Dental Association (ADA), and local state agencies are releasing updates on guidelines for dentists and patients, no official information exists for dental institutions on how to effectively follow the recommended guidelines including "shelter in place" with social distancing to protect students, faculty, staff, and patients, and still ensure continuity of dental education.

32342138, Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake.
32342138, During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination.Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles.
32342138, Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery.
32342138, In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.IV.
32342041, Assuming similar baseline maternal mortality rate as the year of 2018, we projected an increase in maternal mortality rate in the US to at least 18.7 (95% CI, 18.0 - 19.5) deaths per 100,000 live birth as a direct result of COVID-19.COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is expected to severely impact obstetrical care.
32342041, From 3/1/2020 - 12/31/2020, we project 3,308 severe and 681 critical cases, with about 52 COVID-19 related maternal mortalities during delivery hospitalization in the United States.

32341946, In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms.
32341946, However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation.
32341946, Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences.
32341946, The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).© 2020 The Author(s).

32341229, Over two million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and as of April, 14th 2020, there were over 5000 confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia (SA).
32341229, Many countries, including SA, have imposed major restrictions on travel, and everyday life, and the implications of these necessary changes are being felt in liver transplant (LT) centers in SA.
32341229, Concerns remain that there is an increased risk for individuals over 65 years of age, with underlying medical conditions, or for those who are immunocompromised.
32341229, Therefore, the Saudi Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Transplantation (SASLT) established an urgent task force to launch a statement that can be utilized by LT centers as a guidance in the management of patients with advanced liver disease from the time of LT listing to the post-operative care of transplanted patients.

32340627, As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients.
32340627, Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure.The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible.
32340627, Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy.
32340627, The safety of healthcare professionals who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating is paramount.
32340566, However, increased funding itself will not ease the workload.
32340566, With a number of our staff isolating from work due to COVID-19, we as the workforce have to step out of comfort zones and work in unfamiliar specialties.
32340566, These are unprecedented times and are placing strains on our health service.

32340551, In this study, some natural product compounds are tested against the HSPA5 substrate-binding domain β (SBDβ), which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike.
32340551, Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations are used to test some natural compounds binding to HSPA5 SBDβ. The results show high to a moderate binding affinity for the phytoestrogens (Diadiazin, Genistein, Formontein, and Biochanin A), chlorogenic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, hydroxytyrosol, cis-p-Coumaric acid, cinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, and some physiological hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cholesterol to the HSPA5 SBDβ. Based on its binding affinities, the phytoestrogens and estrogens are the best in binding HSPA5, hence may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the stressed cells.
32340551, These compounds can be successful as anti-COVID-19 agents for people with a high risk of cell stress like elders, cancer patients, and front-line medical staff.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32340120, For instance, the inflammation that is induced at the sites of infection could tie these viruses to each other in a relationship.
32340120, Another example, bovine herpesvirus 1, which is an important pathogen of cattle, can cause a severe respiratory infection; the same way in which SARS-CoV-2 affects humans.
32340120, Considering the current circumstances related to the COVID-19 crisis, this editorial paper, which belongs to the Special Issue "Recent Advances in Herpesviruses Research: What's in the Pipeline?" aims to draw attention to some natural anti-herpesvirus alkaloid compounds, which have recently been proven to have excellent inhibitory efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 replication.
32340120, Thus, this special focus is an attempt to hunt down various treatment options to combat COVID-19 based on repurposing drugs that are known to have multiple antiviral properties, including against herpesvirus.
32340094, Conclusion: Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19.
32340094, The first-level emergency response initiated by provincial and municipal government was effective and ensured the start of work resumption after the Spring Festival.
32340094, Metropolitans like Shenzhen can also achieve the goals of strategies and measures for containment and mitigation of COVID-19.
32340091, Conclusions: The epidemic cycle of COVID-19 in Hubei province proposed to be 60 days, which was about 1.76 times of the combination of the longest incubation period or isolation period (14 d) and the average hospitalization time of confirmed patients in Hubei province (20 d).
32340091, It suggested that the major anti-epidemic decisions made in China were effective.
32340090, Conclusions: The fitting degree of the models are good.
32340090, The LBS big data and effective distance model can be used to estimate the track, time and extent of epidemic spread to provide useful reference for early warning, prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.
32339477, Social distancing should be encouraged to prevent the spread of infection, and creative and innovative ways to reduce contact may need to be considered.

32338809, The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted.
32338809, This document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context.
32338809, Practical steps suggested are protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the role of a wider community support.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
32338533, Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection.
32338533, In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses.
32338533, This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event.
32338533, Potential mechanisms of fetal protection from maternal viral infections are also discussed.
32338071,Racial capitalism is a fundamental cause of the racial and socioeconomic inequities within the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in the United States.
32338071, The overrepresentation of Black death reported in Detroit, Michigan is a case study for this argument.
32338071, Racism and capitalism mutually construct harmful social conditions that fundamentally shape COVID-19 disease inequities because they (a) shape multiple diseases that interact with COVID-19 to influence poor health outcomes; (b) affect disease outcomes through increasing multiple risk factors for poor, people of color, including racial residential segregation, homelessness, and medical bias; (c) shape access to flexible resources, such as medical knowledge and freedom, which can be used to minimize both risks and the consequences of disease; and (d) replicate historical patterns of inequities within pandemics, despite newer intervening mechanisms thought to ameliorate health consequences.
32338071, Interventions should address social inequality to achieve health equity across pandemics.

32337662, In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (-ve).
32337662, Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE).
32337662, Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images.
32337662, Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate.
32337516, For the purposes of comparison, a conventional 3D-printed mask (from the original STL files, without being customized for the face scan) was also 3D printed from the original STL files.
32337516, Both face masks were tested on the same two volunteers.The customized 3D-printed face mask presented a higher adaptation compared with the conventional face mask.
32337516, The area of facial contact matched the one digitally designed in the software.
32337516, The 3D-printed grid could clip exactly into the filter, which in turn could be precisely screwed into the body of the face mask.Within the limitations of this technical report, the present findings suggest that customized 3D-printed face masks with enhanced adaptation can be digitally designed using face scans and free CAD software.

32337192, Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
32337192, In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv.
32337192, In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses.
32337192, Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.Copyright: © Journal of Biomedical Physics and Engineering.

32335749, The available knowledge on the viral genomics, molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses of the Coronaviridae family and other Nidovirales, forms a helpful template for understanding the present pandemic outbreak.
32335749, However, important questions remain unanswered about the underlying mechanism causing the very high case fatality ratios (CFR) and mechanisms regarding severe reactions like ARDS, fatal cardiac and renal failures, associated with a number of important comorbidity factors.
32335749, Immunological reactions to lung alveoles in particular (involving lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cell damage) in late phase ARDS in SARS-like CoV diseases, so far may not have received enough attention.
32335749, Finally a shortlist of questions for high priority further research is suggested.

32334422,Rapid, sensitive and specific detection and reporting of infectious pathogens is important for patient management and epidemic surveillance.
32334422, We demonstrated a point-of-care system integrated with a smartphone for detecting live virus from nasal swab media, using a panel of equine respiratory infectious diseases as a model system for corresponding human diseases such as COVID-19.
32334422, Specific nucleic acid sequences of five pathogens were amplified by loop-mediated isothermal amplification on a microfluidic chip and detected at the end of reactions by the smartphone.
32334422, Pathogen-spiked horse nasal swab samples were correctly diagnosed using our system, with a limit of detection comparable to that of the traditional lab-based test, polymerase chain reaction, with results achieved in ∼30 minutes.
32334207, In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths.
32334207, The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan.

32333818, We discuss the unique role of IFNλ in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may impair IFNλ induction, leading to a delayed type I IFN-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease.
32333818, We also consider the potential windows of opportunity for therapeutic intervention with IFNλ and potential safety considerations.
32333818, We conclude that IFNλ constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for reducing viral presence and hyperinflammation in a single shot to prevent the devastating consequences of COVID-19 such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).© 2020 The Authors.

32333581,In the hands of experienced examiners, the contrast enhanced sonography (CEUS) offers the possibility to analyze dynamic microcirculatory disturbances in real time dynamically without any risk for kidneys and thyroid gland even in severe progressing disease bedside.
32333581, Based on severe COVID-19 infections, first experiences with abdominal CEUS examinations are presented.
32333581, In the stage of an imminent organ failure with significantly reduced kidney and liver function, CEUS can be used to show a narrowing of the organ-supplying arteries, as well as a delayed capillary filling of vessels near the capsule, a regional reduced parenchymal perfusion or an inflammatory hyperemia with capillary hypercirculation.
32333581, It is possible to quickly rule out organ infarction and to dynamically record the mesenteric arterial and venous blood flow.
32333552, Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed.
32333552, For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations.
32333552, The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption.
32333552, Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.
32333243, Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care.
32333243, Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola.
32333243, They can be applied here.
32333243, At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.
32333185, Four decades into the HIV epidemic we have learned a considerable amount of information regarding social and behavioral approaches to addressing disease transmission.
32333185, Here we outline broad, scoping lessons learned from the HIV literature tailored to the nature of what we currently know about COVID-19.
32333185, We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research.
32333185, The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.
32333024, However, conceptual differences must be accounted for, requiring close monitoring and the presence of trained personnel.
32333024, Modern transport ventilators are mainly for bridging purposes as they can only be used with 100% oxygen in contaminated surroundings.
32333024, Unconventional methods, such as "ventilator-splitting", which have recently received increasing attention on social media, cannot be recommended.
32333024, This review intends to provide an overview of the conceptual and technical differences of different types of mechanical ventilators.
32332856, However, the 13 subjects with haematological cancers had more severe COVID-19 and more deaths compared with hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19.
32332856, Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002).
32332856, Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate.
32332856, Because we were unable to identify specific risk factors for COVID-19 in hospitalised persons with haematological cancers, we suggest increased surveillance and possible protective isolation.
32332322, Although reductions in the frequency of prenatal visits and implementation of telehealth interventions provide some options, there still remains a need for patient-health care professional visits.
32332322, A drive-through prenatal care model was developed in which pregnant women would remain in their automobiles while being assessed by the health care professional, thus reducing potential patient, health care professional, and staff exposure to COVID-19.
32332322, Drive-through prenatal visits would include key elements that some institutions cannot perform by telehealth encounters, such as blood pressure measurements for evaluation for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, fetal heart rate assessment, and selected ultrasound-based measurements or observations, as well as face-to-face patient-health care professional interaction, thereby reducing patient anxiety resulting from the reduction in the number of planned clinic visits with an obstetric health care professional as well as fear of virus exposure in the clinic setting.
32332322, We describe the rapid development of a drive-through prenatal care model that is projected to reduce the number of in-person clinic visits by 33% per patient compared with the traditional prenatal care paradigm, using equipment and supplies that most obstetric clinics in the United States can access.
32332154, There are, however, a range of complicating factors including the strength of duty to treat which varies according to the HCW's role, the vulnerability of family members to the disease, the willingness of family members to risk infection and the resources available to the HCW to protect their family.
32332154, In many cases, HCWs in 'frontline' roles with a weak duty to treat and families at home will be morally permitted to abstain from work given the risks posed by COVID-19; therefore, society should provide additional incentives to maintain sufficient staff in these roles.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

32331401, Data were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression.
32331401, Results revealed that elevated psychological distress was found among those who have background illness, fear of contracting COVID-19 from patient, and a higher subjective overload.
32331401, Lower psychological distress was associated with being in a committed relationship and having higher scores for self-efficacy.
32331401, Given these results, gathered during times of an infectious disease outbreak, exploring psychological distress among dental staff is warranted as the effects may be long-term.
32331259, The current article explores the food systems in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
32331259, It provides insights about the properties of bioactive ingredients of foods and herbs for the support of the human immune system against infections before discussing the possibility of COVID-19 transmission through the food chain.
32331259, It also highlights the global food security issues arising from the fact that one-third of the world's population is on lockdown.
32331259, Finally, it underlines the importance of sustainability in the food chain in order to avoid or reduce the frequency of relevant food and health crises in the future.
32331255, The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future.
32331255, At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19.
32331255, The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies.
32331255, In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions.
32330858, Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options.
32330858, Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient.
32330858, Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

32330208, These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020.
32330208, Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.
32330208, Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations.
32330208, This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.
32330124,With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment.
32330124, Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment.
32330124, The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response.
32330124, Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.
32330115, Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload.
32330115, No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families.During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals.
32330115, To boost individuals' motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals' perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.©Ali Farooq, Samuli Laato, A K M Najmul Islam.

32329548,Among the Australian and UK governments' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the designation of outlets selling alcohol for off-premise consumption as 'essential' services, allowing them to remain open while pubs, hotels and restaurants have been forced to close.
32329548, In a context of restrictions on movement outside the home in both countries, and where alcohol providers are trying to find new ways to reach their customers, this may lead to an intensification of the social and health harms associated with home drinking.
32329548, By examining the current situation in both Australia and the UK, we argue that heightened risks from home drinking amid COVID-19 bring into sharp focus long-standing weaknesses within licensing systems in both countries: the regulation of off-premise outlets to minimise harms from drinking at home.
32329548, We call for critical conversations on how licensing systems should be revised to take more responsibility for protecting people from the health and social harms associated with home drinking, both under COVID-19 and in the future.© 2020 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.
32329337, We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration.
32329337, Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies.
32329337, Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of "fit" and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently.
32329337, Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.
32329159,The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak causing the respiratory disease COVID-19 has left many chemists in academia without an obvious option to contribute to fighting the pandemic.

32329014, Keeping healthcare providers safe, healthy, and available to work throughout this pandemic is critical.
32329014, The consistent use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) will help assure its availability and healthcare provider safety.
32329014, The purpose of this communique is to give both anesthesiologists and other front-line healthcare providers a framework from which to understand the principles and practices surrounding PPE decision-making.
32329014, We propose three types of PPE including: 1) PPE for droplet and contact precautions, 2) PPE for general airborne, droplet, and contact precautions, and 3) PPE for those performing or assisting with high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures.

32328219, Perhaps for the first time, behavior analysts hold the reinforcers for increasing parental involvement in effective child-rearing practices.
32328219, In fact, behavior analysts can help parents enlist their children in managing the household by framing their behavior in terms of hidden superpowers.
32328219, In the current article, we argue that behavior analysts have a range of tools to offer that are grounded in evidence-based principles, strategies, and kernels-or essential units of behavioral influence.
32328219, When combined into scheduled daily practices and invoked by children taught to see their use of the tools as nothing short of heroic, these practices function as "vaccinations" that inoculate families against toxic and unsafe behaviors.© Association for Behavior Analysis International 2020.
32327383, The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies.Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard.
32327383, Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound.Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting.
32327383, However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus.The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.Copyright © 2020.

32324530, Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5% (95% CI 36.9%-50.4%).
32324530, The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2% (95% CI 11.6%- 22.0%).
32324530, Of the 97 persons with confirmed COVID-19, only 4 (1.9%) remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine, and none of their household contacts acquired secondary infections.
32324530, Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings.
32324428, A single symptomatic COVID-19 infection would cost a median of $3,045 in direct medical costs incurred only during the course of the infection.
32324428, Eighty percent of the U.S. population getting infected could result in a median of 44.6 million hospitalizations, 10.7 million ICU admissions, 6.5 million ventilators used, and 249.5 million hospital bed days, costing $654.0 billion in direct costs over the course of the pandemic.
32324428, If 20% were to become infected, there would be a median of 11.2 million hospitalizations, 62.3 million hospital bed days, and 1.6 million ventilators used, costing $163.4 billion.

32323565, Twenty-one of these were significantly downregulated in the cells from the elderly.
32323565, These downregulated candidates were subjected to enrichment using the Reactome Database identifying that in the elderly, the ability to respond to heme deficiency and the ATF4-dependent ability to respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress is significantly compromised.
32323565, SOD3-based therapeutic strategies have provided beneficial results in treating lung disorders including fibrosis.

32323287, In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise.
32323287, Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly.
32323287, For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times.
32323287, If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32322988, Inside the hospital, new isolation capacities in the emergency room and a dedicated COVID-19 ward were set up.
32322988, The patient flow was reorganized using flow diagrams for both the outpatient and inpatient areas.
32322988, The general and special emergency management was optimized for the efficient treatment of COVID-19-positive patients and the staff were trained in the use of protective equipment.
32322988, This report of our experience is intended to support other emergency departments in their preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32322758, Previous to the pandemic we commonly utilized total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with a strong preference for long course chemoradiation (LCCRT).
32322758, In the setting of the ongoing pandemic we now mandate short course radiation therapy (SCRT).
32322758, Despite multiple randomized trials demonstrating no difference in locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or overall survival between SCRT and LRCCT, adaptation of SCRT in the United States has been low given concerns for less tumor downstaging and increased toxicity.
32322758, In the setting of the ongoing and likely prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we feel that these concerns must be re-evaluated, as SCRT presents a well-validated alternative that will allow us to meet the needs of a greater number of potentially curable patients, at a time when our resources are severely and acutely constrained.© 2020 The Author(s).
32322691, Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported.
32322691, We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration.

32322159, In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop.
32322159, This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water).
32322159, One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, and nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to chronic diseases.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

32322046, Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA ≥ 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17-23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score < 17).
32322046, Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition.A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group.
32322046, There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups.
32322046, Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition.The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.
32321856, We designed and synthesized two lead compounds (11a and 11b) targeting Mpro Both exhibited excellent inhibitory activity and potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity.
32321856, The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a or 11b, both determined at 1.5 Å resolution, showed that the aldehyde groups of 11a and 11b are covalently bound to Cys145 of Mpro Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity, suggesting that these compounds are promising drug candidates.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

32320809, Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies.
32320809, Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0.
32320809, Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32320740, In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9-1.2), p = 0.02 versus the levels on admission).
32320740, The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.
32320740, Logistic regression analysis showed increasing odds of lowered LDL levels associated with disease progression (odds ratio: 4.48, 95% IC: 1.55-12.92, p = 0.006) and in-hospital death (odds ratio: 21.72, 95% IC: 1.40-337.54, p = 0.028).LDL levels inversely correlated to disease severities, which could be a predictor for disease progress and poor prognosis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32320517, Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration.From March 19 to April 11, 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE.
32320517, Eight patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation.
32320517, The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69%. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100% vs 56%, respectively, P = .03).
32320517, Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms.Our results suggest considering both systematic screening of VTE and early therapeutic anticoagulation in severe ICU COVID-19 patients.© 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

32320494, The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications.
32320494, In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried.
32320494, The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for new infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering.The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families.

32320327, At a minimum, healthcare workers delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear N95 respirators and full-face shields.
32320327, Several mechanisms exist to boost and protect the supply of N95 respirators, including rigorous decontamination protocols, invoking the Defense Production Act, expanded use of reusable elastomeric respirators, and repurposing industrial N95 respirators.
32320327, Finally, homemade facial coverings do not protect healthcare workers and should be avoided.
32320327, These strategies, coupled with longer-term strategies of investments in protective equipment research, infrastructure, and data systems, provide a framework to protect healthcare workers immediately and enhance preparedness efforts for future pandemics.
32320091, SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humans that is highly contagious, can spread quickly, and is capable of causing enormous health, economic and societal impacts in any setting.

32319442,On February 21st, 2020 the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome due to the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the CoViD-19 disease, was identified in Italy.
32319442, In the following days, despite the restrictive public health measures aimed to avoid the infection's spread, the number of cases increased.
32319442, As of March 8th, 2020, Italy is the 2nd most affected country in the world.
32319442, As of March 6th, 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published operational recommendations and ethical considerations to support the clinicians involved in the care of critically-ill CoViD-19 patients, in regard a probable scenario where an imbalance between supply and demand of ICU beds, is put in place by a steadily rising number of these patients.
32319424, Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation.
32319424, In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential.
32319424, Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important.
32319424, This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.
32318891, However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients.
32318891, Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients.
32318891, The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination.
32318891, Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.
32318324, Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators.
32318324, For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
32318324, Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
32318324, The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed.For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
32317409, Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them.
32317409, One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health.
32317409, This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions.
32317409, Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.
32317408, Drug repurposing that has emerged as an effective drug discovery approach from earlier approved drugs could reduce the time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery.
32317408, Direct virus-targeted antiviral agents target specific nucleic acid or proteins of the virus while host-based antivirals target either the host innate immune responses or the cellular machineries that are crucial for viral infection.
32317408, Both the approaches necessarily interfere with viral pathogenesis.
32317408, Here we summarize the present status of both virus-based and host-based drug repurposing perspectives for coronaviruses in general and the SARS-CoV-2 in particular.
32317202, As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease.
32317202, Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future.
32317202, We have identified some opportunities for academic research related to COVID-19 and have also provided suggestions to contain, prevent and treat this viral infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

32317044, This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020.
32317044, The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India.
32317044, If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse.The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further.
32317044, This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.
32316979, Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife.
32316979, The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas.
32316979, In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena.
32316979, The COVID-19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings' existence.
32316872, Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization.
32316872, Countries who are successful at aggressive screening, early identification, patient isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and infection control methods should also address the risk of stigmatization among populations and the negative effects which could occur.
32316872, The cases of COVID-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections.
32316872, Timely and appropriate public health interventions addressing cultural impact and risk for stigmatization along with proper screening, treatment, and follow up for affected individuals and close contacts can reduce the number of infections, serious illness, and deaths.
32316719, Conclusion: The observation of high-level ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in conjunctiva among the 6 eye tissues examined suggests that conjunctiva serves as an infection target tissue of 2019-nCoV. (Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:).
32316233, The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min).
32316233, The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min).Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor.
32316233, Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
32316233, To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.
32316065, Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders.
32316065, Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19.
32316065, This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed.
32316065, With limited experience on COVID19-associated VTE, this expert consensus statement should be helpful for clinicians worldwide with specific suggestions.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.
32316063, In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy.

32315244, Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke.
32315244, We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure.
32315244, We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.
32315026, None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19.A robust staff protection and health surveillance system that is routinely implemented during non-outbreak periods and enhanced during the COVID-19 outbreak is effective in protecting frontline staff from the infection.© The Author(s) 2020.

32314954, It reflects on baseline requirements, regulations and recommendations, triggers, and implementation.
32314954, Those desiring a successful recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic need to adopt an evidence-based framework now to ensure community stabilization and sustainability.
32314850, Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses.
32314850, Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
32314850, The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway.

32314700, In the global North, many frontline workers are now being similarly forced to provide and ration care in unprecedented ways, with minimal guidance.
32314700, We outline six reflections gained as Western practitioners working in resource-denied settings which inform our current experience with COVID-19.
32314700, The reflections include the following: managing trauma, remaining flexible in dynamic situations, and embracing discomfort to think bigger about context-specific solutions to collectively build back our systems.
32314700, Through this contextualized reflection on resilience, we hope to motivate strength and solidarity for providers, patients, and health systems, while proposing critical questions for our response moving forward.
32314697, Current levels of funding look increasingly unstable as climate change, social unrest, and, now, disruptive pandemics present threats not only to health but also to the mechanisms that manage it, and to funding itself.
32314697, The growth in "global health" schools, technology development laboratories, nongovernmental organizations and multilateral institutions in donor countries has delivered not only successes but also disappointment, and reflect a paradigm that is in many ways contrary to the principles of population-based ownership that they espouse.
32314697, Although the novel coronavirus disease crisis has underlined the importance of health access and health service capacity, we may have a limited window of opportunity in which to rethink the current model and improve both efficiency and effectiveness.
32314697, With a dose of humility, we may all benefit from studying our own rhetoric on human-centered design and applying these principles across global health to ensure that our approach is effective, efficient, and defensible.
32314503, Further understanding the link between obesity and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, as this could aid proper tailoring of immunomodulatory treatments, together with improving stratification among those possibly requiring critical care.

32314059, An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases.There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital.
32314059, A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well.We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world.
32314059, From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic.
32314059, With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.
32314058,This document from the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) aims to present the main imaging features, and the role of CT scan in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, describing, in particular, the typical findings which make it possible to identify the disease and distinguish it from bacterial causes of infection, and to define which category of patients may benefit from CT imaging.
32314058, The precautions that must be taken when performing scans to protect radiologists and technologists from infection will be described.
32314058, The organisational measures that can be taken within radiology departments in order to cope with the influx of patients, while continuing to manage other emergency and time-sensitive activity (e.g. oncology, other infectious diseases etc.), will be discussed.
32314058, KEY POINTS: • Bilateral ground glass opacities are typical CT manifestations of COVID-19. • Crazy paving and organising pneumonia pattern are seen at a later stage. • Extensive consolidation is associated with a poor prognosis.
32314034, Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients.
32314034, Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out.
32314034, Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions.
32314034, Last but not least, logistics and manpower plans were drawn up in anticipation of resource demands and measures to improve the mental well-being of staff were implemented.We hope our measures during this COVID-19 pandemic can help ophthalmologists globally and serve to guide and maintain safe access in ophthalmology clinics when faced with similar disease outbreaks.
32313879, The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Key Project Grants of the National Science Foundation of China.© 2020 The Author(s).

32313361,How do governments in China and Western democracies differ in their technological response to control the transmission of the pandemic? Based on an analysis of academic papers, World Health Organization reports and newspapers, this research compares two opposing approaches, whereas the Chinese cities and government have adopted a techno-driven approach, Western governments have adopted a human-driven approach to control the transmission of Covid-19.
32313361, The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views.
32313361, It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented.
32313361, This paper contributes to literature by understanding the human-technology relationship, and offers five practical observations for controlling virus transmissions during pandemics.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.
32313360, As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries.
32313360, To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; "optimising" the employment services" in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector.
32313360, In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided.
32313360, This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen - or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

32312355, Each panelist was selected for their unique personal expertise, ranging from front-line emergency physicians from multiple countries, an international media personality, former director of the US Strategic National Stockpile, and one of the foremost international experts in disaster medicine and public policy.
32312355, The forum was moderated by one of the most widely recognized disaster medical experts in the world.
32312355, The four panelists were asked three questions regarding the current pandemic as follows:1.What do you see as a particular issue of concern during the current pandemic?2.What do you see as a particular strength during the current pandemic?3.If you could change one thing about the way that the pandemic response is occurring, what would you change?
32311865, When a worker coughs or releases droplets near a colleague's respiratory system, the droplets can spread throughout the call center space through the air flow.
32311865, If there is only one infected person, there is a chance that the infection cluster will increase.
32311865, Installation of air purifiers may cause new problems, so the control to prevent infection should not lead to a new infection.
32311865, Therefore, using the air purifier to control the COVID-19 should be approached with caution.
32311760, A total of five (n = 5) plasma and three (n = 3) platelet products were evaluated in this study.In both experiments, the measured titre of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light.
32311760, The mean log reductions in the viral titres were ≥3·40 and ≥4·53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively.Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titre of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture.

32308940,To estimate the number of confirmed cases and the rate of death and also to investigate the cause of death in Italy, Iran and South Korea in the next month.Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration.
32308940, Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues.We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually.
32308940, If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities.Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran.
32308940, South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month.Given the prevailing conditions around the world and the increasing number of casualties, it is essential that all countries, especially those with fewer days of involvement, shall do their best to avoid major losses and damages.©2020 RIGLD, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases.

32306408, Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase).
32306408, This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline).
32306408, An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators.The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19.
32306408, But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.© 2020 AMPCo Pty Ltd.
32306149, Our projections assume that the government measures will remain in place during this period.
32306149, The evolution of the epidemic in different Italian regions suggests that the earlier the measures were taken in relation to the stage of the epidemic, the lower the total cumulative incidence achieved during this epidemic wave.
32306149, Our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the Covid-19 CI growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid-March (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern Italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid-March to reach the high levels already present in northern regions.
32306149, As several governments indicate that their aim is to "push down" the epidemic curve, the evolution of the epidemic in Italy supports the WHO recommendation that strict containment measures should be introduced as early as possible in the epidemic curve.

32304561, In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk.
32304561, To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures).
32304561, This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide.
32304561, It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.
32304387, While efforts are underway to contain disease spread and transmission, the authors believe that this is an opportune time to examine and reflect on the impact that medical crises like COVID-19 can have on medical training and education and to evaluate "business continuity plans" to ensure quality medical education even in the face of constant disruptions from pandemic outbreaks.
32304387, Medical training is as important a mandate as patient care and service.
32304387, The authors believe that even in trying times like this, rich and precious lessons can be sought and taught, which will immensely benefit medical students and residents-the health care leaders of tomorrow.
32304387, In this Perspective, the authors discuss the various ways in which the COVID-19 crisis has affected medical instruction in Singapore and explore pertinent practical and creative solutions for the continuity of medical training in these trying times, drawing on their previous experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 as well as the current ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
32304371, Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence.
32304371, This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents.
32304371, All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.
32304371, Therefore, public health literacy is needed.
32304192, Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk.
32304192, Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended.
32304192, The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented.
32304192, In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole.
32304119, The result of this pandemic is a large and increasing number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilator support.
32304119, The rapid rise in endotracheal intubations coupled with prolonged ventilation requirements will certainly lead to an increase in tracheostomy procedures in the coming weeks and months.
32304119, Performing tracheostomy in the setting of active SARS-CoV-2, when necessary, poses a unique situation, with unique risks and benefits for both the patient and the health care providers.

32303885, During the observational period, none of 17 anesthesiologists were infected.
32303885, Although intubation improved SPO2, reduced PaCO2 and blood lactate, seven of 20 patients died within 7-days after tracheal intubation.
32303885, Non-survivors showed significantly lower SPO2 and higher PaCO2 and blood lactate compared to survivors.
32303885, For those who are anticipated to deteriorate severe pneumonia with poor prognosis, earlier respiratory support with tracheal intubation may be advised to improve outcome.
32303497, Although some encouraging outcomes have been reported, and these results have been received enthusiastically, we recommend careful and critical evaluation of current evidence only when all methods and data are available for peer review.

32303027, COVID-19, a virus caused by the novel coronavirus that was initially identified on December 2019, in Wuhan city of China is currently affecting 146 territories, states and countries raising distress, panic and increasing anxiety in individuals exposed to the (actual or supposed) peril of the virus across the globe.
32303027, Fundamentally, these concerns ascend with all infections, including those of flu and other agents, and the same worldwide safeguards are compulsory and suggested for protection and the prevention of further diffusion.
32303027, However, media has underlined COVID-19 as rather an exclusive threat, which has added to panic and stress in masses which can lead to several mental health issues like anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder which should be contained immediately in its initial phases.
32303026, Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services.
32303026, These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic.

32302370, We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or Congress) to lead the response.
32302370, Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19.
32302370, The majority of respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak.
32302370, Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.
32302285, Situated in a variety of non-healthcare structures, ACS may be used for ambulatory, acute, subacute, or chronic care.
32302285, Developing alternative care facilities is the disaster-planning step that moves communities from talking to doing.
32302285, This commitment pays real dividends if a disaster of any magnitude strikes.

32302281, They may prevent students from completing any away rotations this academic cycle, challenging the students’ ability to obtain EM Standardized Letters of Evaluation (SLOEs).
32302281, EM’s emphasis on residency group SLOEs over other letter types creates an undue burden on these vulnerable students and makes the application process intrinsically inequitable.
32302281, This inequity warrants a reevaluation of the current application practice.
32302281, This article outlines ASC-EM's proposed recommendations for all stakeholders, including EM program leadership, medical schools, and EM-bound medical students, to consider for the upcoming EM application cycle.
32302279, Additionally, nursing homes and assisted-living facilities across the country have closed their doors to visitors to protect their residents.
32302279, Mobile technology such as applications (apps) could provide a valuable tool to help families stay connected, and to help OAs maintain mobility and link them to resources that encourage physical and mental well-being.

32302279, Our objective was to narratively summarize 15 apps that address physical and cognitive limitations and have the potential to improve OAs' quality of life, especially during social distancing or self-quarantine.
32302265, Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users.
32302265, While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.
32302058, During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
32302058, In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
32302058, In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.

32301928, There have been roughly 1.4 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 83,000 deaths worldwide at the time of this writing (Johns Hopkins University and Medicine, 2020).
32301928, Like most, with the exception of essential personnel, I am at home wondering what is going to happen next and trying to find any positive outcome to this crisis.
32301745, Conclusions The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs.
32301745, We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.
32301745, The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.
32301646, Conclusion Outside of China where there is a low-prevalence of COVID-19 (1-22.9%), chest CT screening of patients with suspected disease had low positive predictive value (1.5-30.7%).
32301298, Fifteen centers were operated for the 3,033 admissions to the COVID-19 therapeutic living centers.
32301298, Only 81 cases (2.67%) were transferred to hospitals after facility isolation.
32301298, We think that this brief severity scoring system for COVID-19 worked safely to solve the hospital-bed shortage.

32299202, However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines “cytokine storm” leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32299202, Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain.
32299202, The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease.
32299202, In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

32298245, Community mobility in all four locations declined from February 26, 2020 to April 1, 2020, decreasing with each policy issued and as case counts increased.
32298245, This report suggests that public policy measures are an important tool to support social distancing and provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVID-19.
32298218, Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2.
32298218, Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD.
32298218, This information is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%).
32298218, However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes between both viruses.
32298149, CONCLUSION.
32298149, To date, the radiology literature on COVID-19 has consisted of limited retrospective studies that do not substantiate the use of CT as a diagnostic test for COVID-19.
32298055, Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response.
32298055, Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates.
32298055, Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes.
32298055, This review discusses the mechanisms of proliferation and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses based on the results of existing research, providing basis for future study on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of human highly pathogenic coronaviruses.
32298016, In this environment, the laryngectomee (patient having previously undergone a total laryngectomy) continues to represent a unique patient with unique needs.
32298016, Given their surgically altered airway, they pose a challenge to manage for the otolaryngologist within the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32298016, In this brief report, we present special considerations and best practice recommendations in the management of total laryngectomy patients.
32298016, We also discuss recommendations for laryngectomy patients and minimizing community exposures.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

32297723, At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32297723, Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
32297723, Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
32297723, Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
32297458, As barriers to adoption of telemedicine are rapidly decreasing, it is important to recognize the need for practical and immediately deployable information that can improve doctor-patient interactions, facilitate accurate documentation, and increase confidence in the transition to virtual visits.
32297458, In this article we aim to outline the components of an outpatient telemedicine visit for physiatrists, with a particular focus on an adapted virtual physical examination.
32297458, Uses of telemedicine may include future large scale concerns such as natural disasters or climate change.
32297458, We describe a general approach to the visit, review definitions of terms commonly used in telemedicine, and offer tips for optimizing the encounter.© 2020 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.
32297175,Thoracic ultrasound seems to adapt to the screening for lung involvement of patients with suspected or ascertained SARS-COVID-19 infection due to its characteristics of easy applicability.
32297175, It can be also a relevant method in monitoring patients.
32297175, B lines are early finding of COVID-19, even in mild-symptomatic subjects; in the most serious cases such as pre-ARDS or ARDS, the B lines end up filling the ultrasound image almost completely, until it merges, so as to create a single hyperechoic image named as "white lung", with distortion and irregularity of the pleural line.
32297175, In advanced stage, lung consolidations are present, representing pulmonary pathological areas that are no longer normally ventilated.

32296777, The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan.
32296777, Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact.
32296777, The scale of the problem is massive.
32296777, Here I consider new approaches to improve patient's biological resistance to COVID-19 using stem cells, and how benefit might be scaled and simplified using synthetic stem cells to meet logistical needs within a short time frame.Crown Copyright © 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

32296266, In light of the current pandemic the authors collated and clustered (using harmonised terminology) the risk mitigation measures taken around the globe in the combat to contain, and since March 11 2020, to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known to cause the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32296266, This overview gathers lessons learnt, providing an update on the current knowledge for authorities, sectors and first responders on the effectiveness of said measures, and may allow enhanced prevention, preparedness and response for future outbreaks.
32296266, Various measures such as mobility restrictions, physical distancing, hygienic measures, socio-economic restrictions, communication and international support mechanisms have been clustered and are reviewed in terms of the nature of the actions taken and their qualitative early-perceived impact.
32296266, At the time of writing, it is still too premature to express the quantitative effectiveness of each risk mitigation cluster, but it seems that the best mitigation results are reported when applying a combination of voluntary and enforceable measures.© 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

32295665, Globally, cumulative numbers of confirmed cases increased by a factor of nine throughout the month.
32295665, During the entire month, cases rose exponentially throughout Europe.
32295665, Starting in mid-March, confirmed cases accelerated coast-to-coast throughout the United States and, on March 26, the United States surpassed all other nations to rank first in numbers of cases.
32295665, COVID-19 mortality lagged several weeks behind but by month's end, death tolls were also rising exponentially.March 2020 was a consequential month when the COVID-19 pandemic wrapped completely around the planet, with outbreaks erupting in most nations worldwide.
32295652, No other country or territory in this region reported a new infection from January 30 to February 28.
32295652, However, 8 (47.0%) countries or territories have reported the first cases in 3 wk since February 28, almost all are islands.
32295652, Many countries maintained a small number of infections for a long time after the first report, but a rapid increase occurred later.
32295652, Deaths occurred in 8 countries with a total CFR of 3.63%, and the CFR varies widely, from 0.39% (Singapore) to 7.14% (Philippines).The regional spread of COVID-19 urgently requires an aggressive preparedness for the Western Pacific Islands.
32295479, MD studies demonstrated that the NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A*11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time.

32294922, Five cross-sectional and two observational studies examined the associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza/pneumonia.
32294922, Most of the current studies suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise may help to reduce the risk of influenza-related infection and improve the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination in older adults.
32294922, In addition, training in traditional Asian martial arts was also found to be beneficial.
32294922, Future research should focus on the different effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on influenza-related diseases.
32294813, A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
32294813, As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32294813, Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32294813, When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32449128, Mortality rate: 19/45 cancer patients vs 5586/42,450 (p = 0.0001).
