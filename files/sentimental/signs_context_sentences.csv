32134861,To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.
32138488,There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock.
32138488,Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19.
32139372,This article will review the new knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its clinical features.
32141279,However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identified due to the symptoms absent.
32141280,The past medical history of CHD and increased level of cTnI are two independent determinants of clinical disease status in patients with COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）危重症患者心肌损伤及患有心血管基础疾病的情况。
32141569,COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology.
32141569,COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV.
32141570,This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks.
32141570,We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.
32141570,The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia.
32142651,A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.
32143990,While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death.
32144890,This minireview summarizes the research literature on the virological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of this epidemic published until end of February 2020.
32145185,This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
32145716,Whatever happens, screening and isolating close contacts remains essential except for clinical treatment during the epidemic.
32145718,Since then, although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical medicine education, and breaking down separations between public health and clinical workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious.
32145718,Consequently, the Chinese people have higher expectations on the modernization of public health governance, and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive medicine and clinical medical education is establishing.
32145718,In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.
32145719,Few days ago, we conducted a study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections of COVID-19, and found them might be the infection source.
32145768,COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread.
32146694,Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission.
32146694,This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.
32146694,Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed.
32146694,As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening.
32146694,Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization.
32146694,The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization.
32147628,Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far.
32149037,The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease.
32149037,The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team.
32149037,The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache.
32149037,The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home.
32149484,Besides respiratory symptoms, there were also gastrointestinal symptoms, of which diarrhea was the most common one. <b>Conclusion:</b> Family clustering had been an important part for COVID-19 cases. <b>目的：</b> 通过对1起家庭聚集性新型冠状病毒肺炎8例病例的流行病学调查分析，探讨流行病学特征，为新型冠状病毒肺炎的防控提供依据。
32149769,Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.
32149773,Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms.
32149773,We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint.
32149773,Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks.
32149773,Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past.
32150748,There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.
32150748,The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.
32150748,These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.
32151335,This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.
32151335,Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020.
32151335,Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.
32151335,The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32152082,The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections.
32152082,LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV.
32153167,Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic area, or had clustering diseases.
32153167,In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases.
32153170,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. <b>Methods:</b> The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.
32153170,The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared.
32154135,However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates.
32154135,The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32154135,Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases.
32154135,In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea.
32154135,Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed.
32155789,Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.
32155789,The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19.
32155789,In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.
32155789,Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).
32156101,More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms.
32156329,We observed good analytical performance in clinical specimens.
32156607,The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract.
32156648,Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment.
32157732,More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR-mediated effector systems to varying degrees.
32157849,Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement.
32157849,The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. <b>Results:</b> A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library.
32157849,Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively.
32157862,Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient’s symptoms did not improve.
32159317,<b>Objective:</b> By analyzing the epidemic characteristics and related indicators of SARS (2003) and COVID-19(2020), to explore the reasons for the similarities and differences of the two epidemics, so as to provide reference for epidemic prevention and control. <b>Methods:</b> The general situation, clinical classification, activity history, contact history, family members' contact and incidence of the two infectious diseases in Guangzhou were collected and used to analyze the time characteristics, occupational characteristics, age characteristics and other key indicators of the two diseases, including the number of cases, composition ratio (%), mean, median, crude mortality, etc. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1 072 cases of SARS (2003) were included in the study. 353 of which were severe cases with the incidence of 30.13%. 43 cases of death were reported with a mortality rate of 4.01%.
32161092,Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
32161940,Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.
32161940,The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.
32161968,Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias.
32161968,We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
32161968,The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19.
32161968,The most common symptoms were fever and cough.
32162081,We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations.
32162081,Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment.
32162212,These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management.
32162699,The main clinical manifestations were respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms.
32162699,In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.
32162702,The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical data, discharge rate, and fatality rate of COVID-19 patients for clinical help.
32162702,The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrieved from four databases.
32162702,We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate and fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis.
32162702,The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%).
32162702,Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%).
32164400,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 135 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical and epidemiological data of 135 cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin were collected, and the data were analyzed with descriptive method.
32164424,Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial.
32164424,We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine.
32164424,We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest <i>in silico</i> findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management.
32165854,However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel.
32166607,The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
32166607,The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease.
32167166,The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms.
32167180,At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation.
32167180,Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.
32167181,Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei.
32167181,The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission.
32167524,Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated.
32167524,To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died.
32167524,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed.
32169119,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
32169119,In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.
32170559,This report describes the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of three cases from a family, suggests the expected therapeutic effects of SHL on COVID-19, and warrants further clinical trials.
32170560,However, some patients also exhibit non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs.
32170865,The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.
32171076,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.
32171076,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
32171192,Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the clinical symptoms and the serial interval between the subsequent cases and the index cases.
32171192,The clinical symptoms between family index cases and subsequent cases are similar, fever is the most common symptoms in the two groups 114 (77.03%) and 92 (48.68%) respectively, the cases with diarrhea symptoms accounted for the least proportion, which were 7 (4.73%) and 5 (2.65%).
32171865,We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported.
32171865,Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children.
32171865,The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared.
32171865,Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification.
32171865,CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation.
32171865,The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.
32171866,Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different.
32171866,To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).
32171866,Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients.
32171866,The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum.
32171867,This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
32171867,Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb.
32171867,Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue.
32171867,Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them.
32171869,Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics.
32171869,The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients.
32171869,The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms.
32171869,Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &lt;0.0001).
32171869,Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms.
32171869,The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.
32171872,Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups.
32171872,In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.
32171952,This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.
32172226,Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail.
32172228,Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.
32172546,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the pathological characteristics and the clinical significance of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (termed by WHO as corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> Minimally invasive autopsies from lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China.
32172669,The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory lung infiltration.
32172672,Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe.
32173110,We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China.
32173110,There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.
32173110,However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization.
32173110,Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.
32173188,On 31 December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of Health and Healthcare (Hubei Province, China) reported that there were 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin with symptoms starting on the 8 December.
32173188,The Ministry of Health summoned the Specialties Societies to prepare a clinical protocol for the management of COVID-19.
32173241,To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.
32173574,The result showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91 ± 3, 95% CI 86-97% ), followed by cough (67 ± 7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51 ± 0, 95% CI 34-68% ) and dyspnea ( 30 ± 4, 95% CI 21-40%).
32173576,To explore the epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and temporal progression of laboratory findings in 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exposed to lopinavir.
32173576,Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃).
32173725,The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.
32173725,Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.
32174053,Here, we report two representative false-negative cases and discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rRT-PCR, including laboratory examination results and computed tomography features.
32174095,Extensive epidemiological, viral immunological, and current clinical evidences support the possibility that pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients.
32174096,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in January 2020, and proposed management strategies for patients with gynecological tumors under risk of COVID19. <b>Results:</b> Three patients were treated COVID19 based on the national diagnosis and treatment protocol as well as research progress.
32174096,Meanwhile, these patients were appropriately adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for gynecological tumors.
32174128,The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020.
32174128,No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).
32174128,The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively.
32174129,Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> This systematic review of current literature on COVID-19 provides insight into the initial and follow-up CT characteristics of the disease.
32175637,Clinical data of fatal cases published by the Chinese Government were studied.
32175637,As of 2 February 2020, the clinical data of 46 fatal cases were identified.
32175797,Clinical entities such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been documented in feline and murine models.
32176772,Related clinical features are needed.
32176772,The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).
32178954,The aim of the present study was to prevent cross-infection in the operating room during emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by following anesthesia management protocols, and to document clinical- and anesthesia-related characteristics of these patients.
32178954,This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study.
32178975,Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.
32179124,Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies.
32179124,We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases.
32179140,To compare the clinical characteristics and the dynamics of viral load between the imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19.
32179140,COVID-19 can present as pneumonia with less onset of symptoms, and the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 may gradually decrease in the tertiary patients.
32179660,Although clinical manifestations of children's COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection.
32179908,We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness.
32179908,When managing such patients, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is essential.
32179910,We study epidemiological and clinical outcome of 55 asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory-confirmed positive for the SARS-Coronavirus-2 by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples.
32180140,Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family members were described.
32180140,The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.
32180140,Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults.
32180175,We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.
32180175,The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients.
32180426,In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus.
32181672,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study.
32181672,The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. <b>RESULTS.</b> One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study.
32181672,The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%).
32181672,Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 [64%]) were also observed in this study. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The early clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough, and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.
32181807,Recent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei.
32181807,To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China.
32181807,Retrospective case series. 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.
32181807,Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
32181807,The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%).
32181903,Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32181911,The role of clinical laboratory data in the differential diagnosis of the severe forms of COVID-19 has not been definitely established.
32181911,IL-6 and d-D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.
32181990,We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32181990,His overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients.
32183901,In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
32183901,Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea.
32183901,During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.
32183934,During the post-discharge surveillance after clinical recovery, swabs were positive in two asymptomatic cases (3.23%).
32183934,Case 1 had presented typical clinical and radiological manifestations on admission, while manifestation in Case 2 was very mild.
32185921,Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.
32186171,<b>Objective:</b> Analyzing the symptom characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) to improve its prevention. <b>Methods:</b> Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data.
32186171,The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. <b>Results:</b> Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased.
32186171,The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P&lt;0.001).
32186171,The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. <b>Conclusions:</b> The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly.
32186171,It warns us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19.
32186894,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020.
32186894,Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. <b>RESULTS.</b> Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period.
32186894,The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients).
32186894,The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32187464,The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.
32187464,Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).
32187464,In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).
32187464,(Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register number, ChiCTR2000029308.).
32187887,From the perspective of clinical pediatricians as the first line fighting the epidemic, this paper will discuss the clinical characteristics, prevention and control measures, outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric cases.
32189015,Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung function.
32189081,Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes.
32189428,While approximately 80% of infected individuals have minimal symptoms, around 15-20% need to be hospitalized, greatly stressing global healthcare systems.
32190904,Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients.
32190908,To better understand its dynamics in Italy, we analyzed complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, obtained directly from clinical samples.
32191174,After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system.
32191623,Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32191623,Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.
32191691,Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients.
32191691,Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion.
32191764,We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital.
32191813,There are likely many people with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection because testing efforts are currently not detecting all infected people, including some with clinical disease compatible with COVID-19.
32191830,Spreading mainly through the droplet route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and chills.
32191830,The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection.
32192278,These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.
32192296,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32192297,Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the specifics of each patient during epidemic situation.
32192580,We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32193037,The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020.
32193831,We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19.
32193831,We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19.
32193831,The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8).
32193905,In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens.
32194253,Elseways, the recurrent virus exposure over a short time-lapse might result in the Antibody Dependent Enhancement, triggering the violent immune reaction responsible for the severe clinical outcomes observed in the Hubei province.
32195887,Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of Wuhan were reviewed.
32195887,With a history of exposure or travelling, symptoms of fever and cough, and the typical CT manifestation such as ground-glass opacity with a peripheral distribution, we should also think of the possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside of Wuhan.
32196083,The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release.
32196083,However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects.
32196083,It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant.
32196083,We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both disease infection and progression.
32196410,Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications.
32196655,To provide clinical management guidelines for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in pregnancy.
32196678,We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases.
32196678,Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed.
32196678,The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations.
32196678,Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia.
32196678,Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses.
32196678,All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.
32196707,In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus.
32196707,Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients).
32196707,In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only.
32196707,However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients.
32197060,Rapid clinical recognition of rhabdomyolysis symptoms in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can be lifesaving.
32197787,Infections in humans cause a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection, to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.
32198163,Clinical trials are needed to determine whether this drug combination might be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection.
32198501,Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid to the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.
32198776,Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.
32198776,Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).
32198834,COVID-19 is novel infectious disease with an evolving understanding of its epidemiology and clinical manifestations.
32198834,Herein we report a case of a COVID-19 infection in a solid organ transplant recipient, in which the first clinical symptoms were of gastrointestinal viral disease and fever, which further progressed to respiratory symptoms in 48 hours.
32198915,Clinicians need to comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics, clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis.
32198985,Based on related laws and regulations, such as the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, and the related guidelines on the prevention and control of the outbreak, combined with the practical work of forensic pathology examination, the Guide to the Forensic Pathology Practice on Death Cases Related to Corona Virus Disease 2019 （COVID-19） （Trial Draft） has been developed.
32199619,To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32199619,Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected.
32199619,The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed.
32199619,The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea.
32199996,Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death.
32199996,The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population.
32199996,Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women.
32200400,As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges widely from mild illness to ARDS with a high risk of mortality, there is a need for more research to identify early markers of disease severity.
32200613,Infections with the Coronaviridae virus family in a small percentage of patients, especially in those over 60 years of age with a positive clinical history, lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome [2].
32201353,Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.
32202240,The two previously reported coronavirus epidemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]) share similar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features as COVID-19.
32202256,Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes.
32202256,Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32202261,While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. :It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms.
32202261,In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community.
32202343,Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.
32202343,Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia.
32202401,This document could be a valid tool to be used in routine clinical practice and, possibly, a cornerstone for further discussion on the topic also considering the further evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32202646,The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively.
32202646,A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]).
32202646,Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P &lt; .001).
32202646,Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008).
32202646,Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P &lt; .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P &lt; .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P &lt; .001).
32203970,Lastly, we discuss the clinical management of COVID-19 patients with existing chronic renal disorders, particularly those in dialysis and with kidney transplants.
32204411,The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people's mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations.
32204411,It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.
32204751,At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available.
32204752,This plan has been verified by clinical practice for 3 weeks.
32204752,With the further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in pregnant women and neonates, it is necessary to update the first edition of the management plan so as to offer a better guide on clinical practice.
32204754,Based on the further knowledge and experience on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the neonatologists updated the plan according to the current evidence, so as to provide a better guide for clinical medical staff to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the NICU.
32204755,Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection present mainly with respiratory symptoms, but less commonly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and tend to have mild clinical symptoms.
32204756,To study the clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infants and young children.
32204756,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020.
32204756,Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea.
32204756,There were only symptoms of the respiratory system.
32204756,Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection.
32204757,The two girls had mild symptoms and rapid recovery, suggesting that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be mild and have a good prognosis.
32204757,There were differences in the clinical symptoms and imaging findings between the twin girls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection has diverse clinical features in children.
32205204,Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.
32205204,Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms.
32205284,To investigate the epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.

32205349,There is a growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in the virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies.
32205349,Recent studies have revealed many attractive threptic options, even if some of them remain to be further confirmed in rigorous preclinical models and clinical trials.
32207032,Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described.
32207032,The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed.
32207032,The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]).
32207032,Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2).
32207032,The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged.
32207032,It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children.
32207208,Under specific circumstances, such as during the current COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women can be a target for respiratory infection, and lung examination may be required as part of their clinical evaluation, ideally avoiding exposure to radiation.
32207542,&quot;Action at a distance&quot; may be the new norm for clinical researchers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that may require social distancing for the next 18 months.

32208917,This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32208917,Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics.
32208917,Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom.
32208917,Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%).
32208917,COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult.
32208917,Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff.
32209163,We describe the clinical picture and laboratory findings 3-23 days since the first symptoms.

32210236,All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history.
32211755,Rapid identification of COVID-19 cases, which is crucial to outbreak containment efforts, is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic symptoms and in settings with limited capacity for specialized nucleic acid-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
32211755,Demographic, clinical, laboratory and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19.
32211755,Using leave-out-one cross validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (Models 1, 2 and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.91, 0.88 and 0.88 respectively.
32211755,Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR-testing and containment efforts.

32211844,The specific epidemiological and clinical features of older COVID-19 patients included significantly higher female gender, body temperature, co-existing of basic diseases and rate of severe and critical type.
32211920,Unlike other acute infectious diseases progressing to sepsis, the severe courses of COVID19 seemingly show prolonged progression from onset of first symptoms to life-threatening deterioration of (primarily) lung function.
32211963,Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis.
32212059,We summarized the effective intervention and prevention measures in the fields of public health response, clinical management, and research development in China, which may provide vital lessons for the global response.
32213260,Clinical trials are needed to guide treatment decisions.
32213556,Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms.

32213556,Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.
32213647,Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have been undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide.
32213700,This brief contribution aims to offer a reflection on the public and clinical role of the bioethicist: a figure able to promote dialogue between the world of medicine and the community, and to face ethical dilemmas even in emergent clinical settings.
32213786,Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask.
32214286,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes.

32215691,To explore the relationship between the imaging manifestations and clinical classification of COVID-19.
32215691,Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations).
32215691,The TSS was compared with the clinical classification.
32215691,The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for independent screening tool.
32215691,The CT visual quantitative analysis has high consistency and can reflect the clinical classification of COVID-19.
32215760,Over the years there have been numerous clinical and non-clinical reports of its broad spectrum of antiviral activity.
32215896,We discuss the clinical management of all ENT patients, but especially of COVID-19 patients from the ENT perspective.
32215956,While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, some patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
32215956,This has important implications to the disease management, transmission, and infection control.
32216009,Clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV that respiratory symptoms, such as cough, are the most common.[

32216961,The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively.
32217113,The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms.
32217113,Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine.
32217117,Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology.
32217117,Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
32217117,Additional experiments and clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation.
32217556,To delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.
32217556,Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.
32217650,Among laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without.
32217650,A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.
32217834,In this issue of the JCI, Chen and colleagues compared the clinical and immunological characteristics between moderate and severe COVID-19.
32217835,METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed.
32217835,Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue.
32217900,We present clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) features of 5 cases of pediatric patients with 2019 novel coronavirus.
32218915,Hereby, we show our recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients, based on very limited clinical evidences; they should be considered as expert opinions, which may be modified according to newly produced literature data.
32219006,The confirmation rate of Wuhan estimated by our model is 0.0643, substantially lower than that of Hubei excluding Wuhan (0.1914), and that of China excluding Hubei (0.2189), but it jumps to 0.3229 after February 12 when clinical evidence was adopted in new diagnosis guidelines.
32219357,To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms.
32219357,The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course.
32219357,She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.
32219357,This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.
32219428,Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.
32219428,In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status.
32219428,The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.
32219626,Based on the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Edition 5), combined with our current clinical treatment experience, we recently proposed a revision of the first edition of &quot;Guidance for maternal and fetal management during pneumonia epidemics of novel coronavirus infection in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital&quot;.
32219814,Patients with central nervous system involvement may show a series of neurological symptoms, which is easy to be misdiagnosed and neglected, thereby increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32219814,Hereditary ataxia is a large group of neurodegenerative diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and high mortality and disability.
32219885,Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic.
32220033,To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from January 20 to February 20, 2020.
32220177,The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia.

32220284,All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days.
32220284,The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.
32220557,The purpose of the present report is to summarize current knowledge and experiences on anesthetic management in this patient population and to provide clinical practice guidelines on anesthetic management and infection prevention and control in these critically ill patients.
32220574,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections.
32220574,Since all patients shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, expanded surveillance of detailed exposure history for suspected patients and application of rapid detection tools are highly recommended.
32220650,Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.
32220650,We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China.
32220650,We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.
32220650,The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).

32221519,The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.
32221519,Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).
32221519,The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32221523,The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32221523,Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging.
32221964,We recommend that staff working in clinical areas expected to receive patients with COVID-19 conduct in-situ simulation in order to detect their own unique risks and aid in the creation of local guidelines of management of patients with COVID-19.
32221973,Clinical data from the Chinese outbreak have been reported, but experiences and recommendations from clinical practice during the Italian outbreak have not.
32221973,We also report on recommendations based on clinical experiences of managing patients throughout Italy.
32221973,In particular, we describe key elements of clinical management, including: safe oxygen therapy; airway management; personal protective equipment; and non-technical aspects of caring for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019.
32221983,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.
32222119,The aim is to evaluate pregnant women infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide help for clinical prevention and treatment.
32222119,Their primary initial manifestations were merely low-grade postpartum fever or mild respiratory symptoms.
32222121,The management and clinical outcome of a sigmoid cancer patient with COVID-19 were analyzed.
32222122,To investigate the clinical outcome of patients with moderate type of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge by retesting viral nucleic acid.
32222122,During the three weeks of quarantined period, the symptoms and signs were documented; and sputum or nasal swab and feces samples were collected to test SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR method.
32222122,There were no symptoms and signs during the quarantine period in all 7 patients.
32222466,In the past two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients.
32222466,Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system.
32222703,With the control of uremia and fluid status, this patient ended up with an uneventful post-CRRT course, absence of clinical symptoms, and negative PCR tests.
32222713,During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital.
32222720,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 that caused difficulties for clinical work.
32222911,Chinese pharmacists have acted swiftly in the public health response in China, such as drafting professional service guidance to pharmacists and pharmacies, establishing emergency drug formularies, monitoring and resolving drug shortages, establishing remote pharmacy services to prevent human-to-human infections, providing event-driven pharmaceutical care, educating the public on infection prevention and disease management, and participating in clinical trials and drug evaluation.
32222986,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method.
32222986,Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%).
32222986,However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups.
32222988,We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak.
32222988,With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73).
32222988,Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms.
32222988,The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found.
32222988,Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%).
32222988,Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.
32223012,Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected.
32223012,We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
32223012,Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19.
32223012,Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials.
32223012,The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention.
32223871,Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria.
32223871,Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%).

32224074,Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared.
32224074,Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P &lt; .05).
32224074,There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1.
32224133,In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks.
32224151,To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown.
32224151,The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020.
32224151,The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%).
32224310,We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge.
32224310,Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log<sub>10</sub> copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.
32224310,We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.
32225135,The public health emergency caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant reallocation of health resources with a consequent reorganization of the clinical activities also in several urological centers.
32225135,In absence of strict uniform regulations that impose the implementation of nasopharyngeal swabs, we recommend that an accurate triage for possible COVID-19 symptoms be performed both by telephone at home before hospitalization and at the time of hospitalization.
32226285,In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the basic characteristics of the pathogen, the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus.
32226287,In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020.
32226287,Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay.
32226287,The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%).
32226288,The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently.
32226288,Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.
32226289,Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.
32226294,The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19.
32226295,Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
32226353,The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases.
32226695,The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature.
32226695,This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).
32226962,While fever and respiratory symptoms have been commonly used to identify COVID-19 suspects, we present an elderly female who arrived to the hospital after a syncopal episode.
32227090,The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among COVID-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury among severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32227091,To retrospectively analyze the evolution of clinical features and thin-section CT imaging of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in 17 discharged patients.
32227091,Longitudinal changes of clinical parameters and CT pattern were documented in all patients during 4 weeks since admission.
32227091,The progression course of CT pattern was later than the clinical parameters within the first two weeks since admission; however, there was a synchronized improvement in both clinical and radiologic features in the 4th week.
32227123,We aimed to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration in COVID-19.
32227123,The levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed.
32227123,After treatment, 37 patients (67%) reached clinical response, with an increase of CD8+ T cells and B cells.
32227123,Peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration was associated with the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy of COVID-19.
32227274,The clinical and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients.
32227274,Information on clinical signs and symptoms, medical treatment, virus clearance, and laboratory parameters including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein were collected.
32227357,Clinical trials should also be undertaken to use statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs but have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties to prevent acute lung injury in COVID-19 infection.
32227758,Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records.
32227758,The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission.
32227758,The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus.
32228222,The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown.
32228222,This evidence supports the benefit of using ACEIs or ARBs to potentially contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
32228226,The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.
32228252,In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease.
32228732,The epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations were analyzed.
32228809,We report epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster.
32228809,These findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment.
32228825,The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms.
32228827,Future basic and clinical research is warranted to validate present results and hypothesis. <b>目的：</b> 探讨冠状病毒感染所致心力衰竭（心衰）的机制，并预测对其可能有疗效的药物。
32229107,We report the dynamic change process of target genes by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 during the course of a COVID-19 patient: from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene, to two positive target genes (orf1ab and nucleocapsid) by RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2, and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case.
32229107,In this case, negative results of RT-PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence.
32229257,We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis.
32229257,At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85).
32229257,There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis.
32229257,Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery.
32229322,For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated.
32229390,Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P &lt; .001).
32229705,This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age.
32229705,This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose.
32229706,Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts.
32229732,Whether the patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important issue worthy of clinical attention.
32229732,This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.
32229732,The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32231171,As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, identification of clinical predictors of severe or fatal disease are necessary to enable risk stratification and optimize allocation of limited resources.
32232217,There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women.
32232218,All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis.
32232230,As one of the busiest specialised hospitals in the world, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology summarised the experience with disease prevention and control and clinical recommendations on the examination, diagnosis and treatment processes, clinical management, healthcare personnel protection and disinfection amid the continued spread of the pandemic.
32232432,However, our current regulations on the flows of information for clinical care and research are antiquated and often conflict at the state and federal level.
32232433,During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.
32232433,Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
32232433,By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms.
32232648,Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.
32232652,In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff.
32232977,With the purpose of letting the public know the overall situation of the clinical trials of new coronary pneumonia in China as soon as possible, we completed the data collection and brief analysis in a very short time.
32233013,Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.
32233034,Clinical departments that perform endoscopy are faced with daunting challenges during this pandemic.
32233641,However, further clinical studies with large sample sizes are required to verify their effectiveness.
32233642,The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis.
32233642,Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms.
32233642,There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics.
32233719,This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally.
32233816,The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults.
32233816,It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate.
32233816,His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus.
32233816,Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition.<b>Conclusion:</b> When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus.
32233876,We review the symptoms, epidemiology, and testing for this disease.
32233980,Background and Purpose- Hyperacute assessment and management of patients with stroke, termed code stroke, is a time-sensitive and high-stakes clinical scenario.
32233980,In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team.
32233980,Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis.
32233980,Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation.
32233980,Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening.
32233980,These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features.
32234126,We suggested that COVID-19 should be diagnosed as 3 types: suspected case, clinical diagnosed case, and definite diagnosed case.
32234127,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different epidemic stages in Gansu province. <b>Methods:</b> Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. <b>Results:</b> As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu.
32234127,The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=2.20, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) and fatigue (trend <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=3.18, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant.
32234127,The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (<i>H</i>=6.45, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).
32234130,As of March 2020, two 2019-nCoV vaccines have entered phase I clinical trials.
32234131,<b>Objective:</b> To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection.
32234131,The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific.
32234250,Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia.
32234250,Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded.
32234250,For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed.
32234451,Although related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which have not been completely understood to date.
32234451,We provide a review of the differences in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features between COVID-19, SARS and MERS.
32234451,COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features.
32234451,It cannot be excluded that because of the COVID-19 less severe clinical picture it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS.
32234465,Here we scrutinise a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection.
32234467,With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death.
32234728,Every month, DTB scans sources of information on treatments, disease management and other healthcare topics for key items to bring to our readers' attention and help them keep up to date.
32235387,While most of the vaccines are under design and preparation, there are some that have entered efficacy evaluation in animals and initial clinical trials.
32235486,We performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32235486,Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results.
32235486,The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%-99%; <i>n</i> = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%-81%; <i>n</i> = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%-55%; <i>n</i> = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; <i>n</i> = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%-23%, <i>n</i> = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%-17%, <i>n</i> = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%-17%, <i>n</i> = 1744).
32235486,The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific.
32235486,Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay.
32235945,By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003<sup>5</sup>.
32235945,However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission<sup>6-8</sup>.
32235945,Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 10<sup>8</sup> RNA copies per throat swab, day 4).
32235945,Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms.
32236295,In this regard, the high number of scientific publications, encompassing in vitro, case studies, observational and randomized clinical studies, and even systematic reviews add up to the uncertainty.
32236624,In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies.
32236983,The range of clinical presentations varies from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32236983,However, the results of preliminary studies and clinical trials are improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Covid-19.
32237161,Knowledge about origin, symptoms, and spread of viral infection was assessed.
32237249,Beginning of March, I worked in the emergency department and treated a patient with viral symptoms without a travel history who was admitted to the hospital.
32237278,Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient.
32237288,Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine and the Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control propose guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical laboratories in Korea.
32238024,A 35-year-old woman presented with fever and mild diarrhoea without any respiratory symptoms 9 days after travelling to Japan from Wuhan, China.
32238024,A lower respiratory tract specimen should be obtained for better diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms for patients with significant travel or exposure history.
32238223,She presented to the hospital because of her concern, but she was without fever or any respiratory symptoms.
32238232,Among the biological nature of the pathogens, viral receptor distribution on the human cells, and the pathological findings in the targeted organs and clinical features of the patients with the diseases, found similarities and differences between the two diseases.
32238358,As the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, the clinical cancer community is grappling with how to continue providing access to experimental but potentially lifesaving therapies while keeping immunocompromised patients safe.
32238358,To that end, cancer centers are making changes to their clinical trial programs, while pharmaceutical companies are deciding how-or whether-trials should continue.
32238429,Infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may remain asymptomatic, leading to under-recognition of the related disease, COVID-19, and to incidental findings in nuclear imaging procedures performed for standard clinical indications.
32238429,Presence, radiological features and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with subsequent short-term clinical course and described in a case series. <b>Results:</b> Six of 65 patients (9%) that underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional FDG-avidity.
32238438,Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss.
32238612,Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation.
32238613,The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32238615,Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.
32238615,Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed.
32238615,To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.
32238615,A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions.
32239125,However, studies and clinical trials in humans are required to know the result of their application in them.
32239127,In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).
32239127,Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.
32239142,Clinical drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to decrease the high fatality rate of confirmed COVID-19 patients.
32239142,Since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available, they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of COVID-19.
32239525,Orleans Parish in Louisiana is in the midst of an exponentially increasing number of patient admissions with COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms.
32239525,Patients have been described having CT findings most consistent with an early-stage (&lt;7 days from symptoms onset) or an advanced stage (8-14 days from symptoms onset).
32239532,Use of LU has helped us in clinical decision making and reduced the use of both chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT).
32239591,The clinical characteristics of patients with liver injury and without liver injury were compared.
32239591,There were no significant differences in age, previous medical history and symptoms between the two groups.
32239761,The clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less understood.
32239761,We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen city, China from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020 and followed until March 6, 2020.
32239796,The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of liver function and its clinical significance in COVID-19 patients.
32239796,However, the clinical significance of the elevation is unremarkable.
32239796,Although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19, and also may not have serious clinical consequences.
32240079,One asymptomatic patient demonstrated virus shedding, indicating potential virus transmission in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms.
32240094,Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19.
32240095,This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19.
32240095,Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.
32240095,General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance.
32240128,Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days.
32240128,Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic.
32240128,Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing.
32240128,The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms.
32240279,A patient presenting with ISOA who went on to test positive for infection with COVID-19 and did not develop any further symptoms as well as a case series of similar patients although limited by the lack of reliable testing at the moment.
32240303,Emergent policy changes related to telemedicine and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have created opportunities for technology-based clinical evaluation, which serves to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and protect emergency providers.
32240462,The efficacy of some promising antivirals, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials.
32240545,Careful clinical evaluation should allow to quickly establish whether such passive immunotherapy, administered at early phases of the disease in patients at high risk of deleterious evolution may reduce the frequency of patient deterioration, and thereby COVID-19 mortality.
32240567,We believe that we need to adequately inform our patients, focusing on hygienic measures and personal protection and prompt reporting of any suspicious symptoms.
32240634,These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).
32240634,Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9-19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9-28·1).
32240670,Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes.
32240670,Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%).
32240670,Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P &lt; 0.001) were strong predictors of death.
32240718,In this Case Report, we describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 in 201 maintenance hemodialysis patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan university, including 5 maintenance hemodialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 disease.
32240718,Diarrhea (80%), fever (60%), and fatigue (60%) were the most common symptoms.
32240754,The strategy focuses on key content areas including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing moderate and severe symptoms, and supporting family members.
32240756,Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it.
32240896,Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in China hardest-hit areas during COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the gender difference existing in PTSS.
32241022,Clinical records, laboratory results, and computer tomography(CT)-scan examination were retrospectively reviewed.
32241022,The clinical characteristics of these ten women were similar to those reported severe COVID-19 patients.
32241244,To date, computed tomography (CT) findings have been recommended as major evidence for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China.
32241244,Since most patients with COVID-19 infection share typical imaging features, radiological examinations have an irreplaceable role in screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects in clinical practice.
32241316,Based on the analysis of the cases of 4 patients, this article finds that early diagnosis requires a combination of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, imaging, and etiology, with particular emphasis on epidemiology history and chest CT manifestations.
32241899,To study the GI symptoms in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.
32241899,We analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 95 cases with SARS-CoV-2 caused coronavirus disease 2019.
32241899,Among the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation.
32241899,Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively.
32241899,Faecal samples of 65 hospitalised patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including 42 with and 23 without GI symptoms, of which 22 (52.4%) and 9 (39.1%) were positive, respectively.
32241899,Six patients with GI symptoms were subjected to endoscopy, revealing oesophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers in one severe patient.
32242182,We recommend that patients on such medications should continue on them unless there is a clinical indication to stop their use.
32242348,In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea.
32242348,Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness.
32242348,The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%).
32242348,Two patients had no symptoms.
32242348,The prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity.
32242438,The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
32242738,To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases with COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan.
32242738,Medical records of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9 and February 15, 2020 were collected.
32242738,Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, CT scans and clinical management.
32242738,Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), dyspnea (60 [70.6%]).
32242830,As patients need to be treated and tested, it is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety.
32242830,The construction of a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital is faced with problems such as time pressure, limited site selection, high level of biosafety, lack of experience and so forth.
32242830,This paper mainly discusses how to construct the clinical laboratory in the modular hospital quickly and safely and put it into use to provide testing service for patients under various limited conditions.
32242947,We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32242947,A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta-analysis.
32242947,The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%; 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%; 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%; 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%; 0.253-0.456), and chest distress (31.2%; -0.024 to 0.648).
32242947,COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease that mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly.
32243068,We recognize that this guidance might be subject to change in the future when further knowledge will be acquired about the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical characteristics of cases of neonatal COVID-19.
32243238,Methods In this prospective study from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled.
32243266,In conclusion, ensuring effective, timely, and safe ECMO support in COVID-19 is key to improving clinical outcomes.
32243269,Besides typical respiratory symptoms and signs of COVID-19, digestive symptoms and liver injury have been frequently reported during the course of the disease.
32243269,Digestive symptoms, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and in some cases digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any respiratory symptoms.
32243270,More clinical trials are being conducted for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating COVID-19.
32243304,Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population.
32243304,The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures.
32243304,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32243304,The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.
32243304,The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32243304,This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32243599,A well-mixed &quot;susceptible exposed infectious recovered&quot; (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority.
32243607,Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed.
32243607,Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness.
32243607,A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms.
32243607,28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness.
32243607,The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did no differ between patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces.
32243668,This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic.
32243672,The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can vary from an asymptomatic course to ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32243673,Clinical data on COVID-19 infection in transplant population is very limited.
32243673,Herein we presented the clinical course and outcome of a 50-year-old male post liver transplantation who contracted COVID-19, with subsequent infection of his wife.
32243690,The initial clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in these three patients were the same, but their progression was different.
32243690,Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward.
32244166,Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32244415,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic affects people's health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), especially in those who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms (S-COVID-19-S).
32244415,The interviews were conducted using printed questionnaires including participants' characteristics, clinical parameters, health behaviors, HL, depression, and HRQoL.
32245083,Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV).
32245395,In the guideline, except for &quot;confirmed cases&quot;, &quot;suspected cases&quot;, &quot;close contact&quot; and &quot;suspicious exposure&quot; were defined by clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and auxiliary examination.
32245396,However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
32245835,The COVID-19 outbreak has had a major impact on clinical microbiology laboratories in the past several months.
32246317,Coagulation results and clinical features of consecutive patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 (COVID group) and non-SARS-CoV2 (non-COVID group) in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed and compared.
32246782,The published clinical features of COVID-19 do not suggest that involvement of the CNS is common.
32246783,In a recent review, we have suggested a neuroinvasive potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its possible role in the causation of acute respiratory failure of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (J Med Viol doi: 10.1002/jmv.25728), based upon the clinical and experimental data available on the past SARS-CoV-1 and the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32246819,All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records.
32246819,Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.
32246834,In addition to the recommended antiviral drugs such as interferon-ɑ, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate, some clinical trials focusing on virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors have been registered and initiated.
32246834,Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp inhibitor approved for use in influenza, is also considered in several clinical trials.
32246834,We hope this will be helpful for the design of clinical trials for favipiravir in COVID-2019, as data regarding in vitro virus inhibition and efficacy in preclinical animal studies are still not available.
32246890,Compared to N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I<sup>2</sup> =0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95%CI 0.98-2.28; I<sup>2</sup> =78%; very low certainty in the evidence).
32247050,Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
32247050,Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems.
32247211,Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs.
32247212,Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly.
32247212,Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients.
32247213,We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers.
32247326,Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms.
32247826,We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families.
32247826,Case 2 presented no clinical or radiographic abnormalities.
32247836,This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing.
32247926,Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia.
32247926,Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms.
32247927,China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32248387,Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy.
32248675,Lower rather than upper respiratory tract viral burden correlates with clinical severity of illness.
32248966,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019.
32248966,COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death.
32249089,To present the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of KTx recipients infected with COVID-19, we report on a case series of five patients who were confirmed as having COVID-19 through nucleic acid testing (NAT) from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020.
32249089,The most common symptoms on admission to hospital were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%); serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset.
32249102,Pharmacists shall use various approaches to provide PC services in drug dispensing, consulting and referrals, chronic disease management, safe use of infusions, patient education, home care guidance and psychological support to promote the COVID-19 pandemic control and ensure safe medication use of community patients during the pandemic.
32249203,We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays.
32249203,Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines.
32249203,Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity.
32249203,Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence.
32249203,Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.
32249257,With no vaccines or drugs approved for prevention and treatment until now, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials of already approved drugs are worthy and creditable.
32249918,We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia.
32249918,Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32249918,Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.
32249943,Children and adults show a different clinical course.
32249943,The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present.
32249943,The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively.
32249943,In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.
32250049,Few children have been reported to have been affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it is unclear whether children are less likely to be infected or rather display fewer symptoms.
32250049,We argue that in epidemic settings children presenting with any mild symptom potentially attributable to COVID-19 should be considered contagious until proven otherwise, and that management must be guided by clinical conditions.
32250170,The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results.
32250170,In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks.
32250244,Based on the current clinical evidence treatment with ACE-inhibitors I (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) continues to provide cardiovascular and renal protection in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32250281,As the medical landscape changes daily with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, clinical researchers are caught off-guard and are forced to make decisions on research visits in their ongoing clinical trials.
32250385,Information about the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require intensive care is limited.
32250385,Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality.
32250505,The COVID-19 epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience.
32250958,On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3).
32250958,More research should be done on the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.
32250959,The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19.
32250959,The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics.
32250959,Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, and infection controls and measures in dental clinics.
32250959,National and international guidelines should be sent by the regional and national dental associations to all registered dentists during a crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, to make sure that dentists are well informed and aware of best practices and recommended disease management approaches.
32250962,Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19.
32250962,A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19.
32250962,Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P&lt;.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P&lt;.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P&lt;.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion.
32251002,Respiratory rehabilitation is an important intervention as well as cure for clinical patients.
32251002,With increased understanding of COVID-19 and the accumulation of clinical experience, we proposed recommendations for respiratory rehabilitation in adults with COVID-19 based on the opinions of frontline clinical experts involved in the management of this epidemic and a review of the relevant literature and evidence.
32251002,Our recommendations are as follows: 1. for inpatients with COVID-19, respiratory rehabilitation would relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression and eventually improve physical functions and the quality of life; 2. for severe/critical inpatients, early respiratory rehabilitation is not suggested; 3. for patients in isolation, respiratory rehabilitation guidance should be conducted through educational videos, instruction manuals, or remote consultation; 4. assessment and monitoring should be performed throughout the respiratory rehabilitation process; 5. proper grade protection should be used following the present guidelines.
32251002,These recommendations can guide clinical practice and form the basis for respiratory rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients.
32251003,The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease.
32251618,PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases were searched Results: A total 22 articles were found eligible. 8 discuss about treatment outcomes from their applied drugs during treatment of COVID-19 patients, 4 report laboratory tests, one report animal trial and other 9 articles discuss recommendations and suggestions based on the treatment process and clinical outcomes of other diseases such as malaria, ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32251618,All examined treatments, although potentiality effective against COVID-19, need either appropriate drug development or clinical trial to be suitable for clinical use.
32251668,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which has been characterized by fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as shedding of virus RNA into feces.
32251668,We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool, and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong.
32251668,We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model.
32251668,Among the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA.
32251668,In a meta-analysis of 60 studies, comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%-24.5%); 11.8% of patients with non-severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1%-29.1%) and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9%-36.7%).
32251668,In an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.
32251729,Colchicine has been utilized safely in a variety of cardiovascular clinical conditions.
32251729,Among its potential mechanisms of action is the non-selective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome which is thought to be a major pathophysiologic component in the clinical course of patients with COVID-19.
32251729,Patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (under RT PCR) and clinical picture that involves temperature &gt;37.5 oC and at least two out of the: i. sustained coughing, ii. sustained throat pain, iii.
32251729,GRECCO-19 trial aims to identify whether colchicine may positively intervene in the clinical course of COVID-19.
32251731,This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor.
32251731,The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.
32251767,We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
32251767,Ribavirin or favipiravir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μM.
32251767,Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.
32251768,Although several clinical trials are now underway to test possible therapies, the worldwide response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring/containment.
32251790,To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.
32251791,This case warns the physicians of patients who have CNS symptoms.
32251794,In this study, we described and discussed the clinical outcomes of ECMO for ARDS patients, ECMO use for severe COVID-19 in China, the indications of ECMO use, and some important issues associated with ECMO.
32251805,This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.
32251805,The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiological assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020.
32251805,The clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19 we summarized, which would be helpful to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.
32251842,Describe the clinical characteristics of patients in Fangcang Hospital.
32251842,Non-critically ill patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests admitted to Dongxihu 'Fangcang' Hospital between February 7th and 12th were included, which was promptly constructed because of the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China; clinical course through February 22nd was recorded. 1012 non-critically ill patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were included in the study. 30 (of 1012, 3.0%) patients were asymptomatic on admission.
32251842,During hospitalization, 16 of 30 (53.3%) asymptomatic patients suffered from different symptoms.
32251842,Fever (761 of 1012, 75.2%) and cough (531 of 1012, 52.4%) were the most common symptoms.
32251842,Non-critically ill patients had different clinical characteristics than critically ill patients.
32252023,The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19.
32252023,Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms.
32252141,The purpose of this review is to summarize known-to-date information about SARS-CoV-2, transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and clinical features.
32252338,Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.
32252591,Infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, produces a clinical syndrome known as COVID-19.
32252784,Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed.
32252784,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever.
32252845,This extreme measure never seen before during peace time was the result of adapting not only the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP) being applied to the national context but also real-time clinical, epidemiological and scientific information about the evolution of COVID-19 infection in the country.
32253068,SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32253172,This involvement may have important implications to the disease management, transmission, and prognosis, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic or digestive co-morbidities.
32253318,The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion.
32253318,The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d.
32253318,This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases.
32253318,The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
32253371,To provide insights on this issue, a 25-items online Survey was sent to all Italian residents one month after the first case of COVID-19 in Italy, to evaluate their routine involvement in &quot;clinical&quot; (on-call duty, outpatient visits, diagnostic procedures) and &quot;surgical&quot; (endoscopic, open and minimally invasive surgery) training activities before and during the COVID-19 period.
32253371,Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of residents routinely involved in &quot;clinical&quot; and &quot;surgical&quot; activities ranged from 79.8% to 87.2% and from 49.3% to 73.5%, respectively.
32253371,In the COVID-19 period, the proportion of residents experiencing a severe reduction (&gt;40%) or complete suppression (&gt;80%) of training exposure ranged between 41.1% and 81.2% for &quot;clinical&quot; activities while between 44.2% and 62.1% for &quot;surgical&quot; activities.
32253449,Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.
32253535,The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms.
32253535,The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite.
32253535,Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms.
32253535,Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases.
32253535,Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms.
32253535,The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.
32253759,The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed.
32253759,Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation.
32253771,This video conference method can be applied to clinical as well as anatomy lessons.
32253890,A series of specific suggestions are put forward including the establishment of a full-chain closed-loop research system to support the cultivation of top-notch innovative public health talents, strengthening the assessment of core public health capabilities for clinical medical professional admission, formulating a &quot;medical and preventive integration&quot; training program for primary health personnel, and implementing &quot;combination of peace and war&quot; public health personnel reserve system, with the purpose of providing reference for the reform and development of preventive medical education in China.
32254064,Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival.
32254064,Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).
32254064,We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, from evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow and proposed clinical trials, as scale up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource. .
32255382,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020.
32255382,Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially ICU resource allocation.
32255413,Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.
32255437,The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed.
32255437,The most prevalent presenting symptoms were fever (64%) and cough (59%), and a mildly elevated mean (SD) C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 11.22(11.06) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 18.8 (15.17) were detected.
32255437,Children with COVID-19 had relatively milder symptoms and less severe lung inflammation than adults.
32255489,However, all ongoing clinical trials with HCQ use different dosing regimens, resulting on various concentrations PK studies are therefore needed to define the optimal dosing regimen.
32255510,In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID-19 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1-2 weeks.
32255567,The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project has commenced and will provide flexible and responsive clinical tools to determine the predictors of key ED-relevant clinical outcomes.
32255567,Regression methodology will be used to generate clinical prediction tools.
32255648,Sharing of data for COVID-19 applications will help connect scientists across the global biomolecular simulation community, and also improve connection and communication between simulation and experimental and clinical data and investigators.
32256547,More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19.
32256547,The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV).
32256547,We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
32256547,Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.
32256705,The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies.
32256706,There have been a number of reports stating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids may exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
32257173,Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action.
32257173,Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak.
32257173,Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting.
32257173,Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed.
32257173,From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology.
32257173,For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled.
32257173,Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols.
32257173,Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.
32257431,However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery.
32257537,The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection.
32257537,The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation.
32257554,A new study published by the journal Aging &amp; Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (<i>Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020</i>).
32257728,This article looks to review specific epidemiological factors, symptomatology, laboratory and imaging workup, and other relevant metrics derived from the limited published literature that are specific to the pediatric population, to provide a review for the pediatric practitioner and guide, in part, the creation of a clinical algorithm for the management of COVID-19 in the pediatric population that can be utilized by pediatric institutions.
32258351,Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials.
32258351,As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded.
32259130,There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 as a new emerging epidemic.
32259130,However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic.
32259130,Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities.
32259197,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenges hospital leaders to make time-sensitive, critical decisions about clinical operations and resource allocations.
32259197,To estimate the timing of surges in clinical demand and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19-induced strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be saturated.
32259247,Although this document provides a framework for pain management services, systems-wide and individual decisions must take into account clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital directives, resource availability, the welfare of health care providers.
32259279,The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy.
32259279,Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2.
32259279,Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed.
32259313,Therapies include novel agents available in clinical trials or through compassionate use, and other drugs, repurposed antiviral and immune modulating therapies.
32259313,The purpose of this review is to summarize practical considerations for pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19, with the intent of serving as a resource for health care providers at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32259322,From a large medical center in Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we report clinical features and prognosis for three women diagnosed with COVID-19 after gynecologic oncology surgery and hospitalized in January 2020.
32259322,By February 20, 2020, only two of the three patients had met the clinical discharge criteria.
32259403,Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed.
32259403,The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms.
32259403,The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients.
32259419,Clinical decision scores may support the clinician's decision-making, especially if properly adapted for this unique pandemic and for the patient being treated.
32259419,This review discusses the use of clinical prediction scores for pneumonia severity at 3 main decision points to examine which scores may provide value in this unique situation.
32259419,Initial data from a cohort of over 44,000 COVID-19 patients in China, including risk factors for mortality, were compared with data from cohorts used to study the clinical scores, in order to estimate the potential appropriateness of each score and determine how to best adjust results at the bedside.
32259546,Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
32259853,Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, exposure history, PCR using specimens from the respiratory tract together with computed tomography (CT) imaging.
32259899,It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms.
32260436,In the clinical routine, prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability worsens the patient outcome.
32260471,However, the performance of IVD assays needs to be critically evaluated before they are employed for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32264666,The clinical features were on a large scale that varies from being an asymptomatic carrier to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction.
32264666,Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms.
32264791,Recombinant human ACE2 has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.
32264898,We aim to describe recommended clinical pathways for COVID-19-positive patients requiring acute non-deferrable surgical care.
32265065,Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses.
32265065,Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32265065,Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine.
32265182,A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway.
32265182,High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians.
32265202,Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection.
32265220,The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms.
32265220,Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.
32265310,Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection.There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19.
32265310,To provide a rationale strategy to maximise potential therapeutic use, it is critically important to understand the relevant pre-clinical studies and postulated mechanisms of MSC actions in respiratory virus-induced lung injuries.
32265310,These are presented along with consideration of current clinical investigations.
32265365,The goal of this review is to provide evidence-based recommendations, or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for anesthesiologists caring for pregnant women during the COVID 19 pandemic, with a focus on preparedness and best clinical obstetric anesthesia practice.
32265372,In the 3 months since its emergence, we have learned a great deal about its clinical management and its relevance to the pediatric critical care provider.
32265372,In this article, we review the available literature and provide valuable insight into the clinical management of this disease, as well as information on preparedness activities that every PICU should perform.
32266184,None of the infants developed serious clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or abnormal radiologic or hematologic evidence, and all four infants were alive at the time of hospital discharge.
32266184,This case report describes the clinical course of four live born infants, born to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.
32266987,Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy).
32266987,Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83).
32267047,The pediatric population has been found to be less susceptible to the disease with the majority of children having milder symptoms and only one pediatric death being reported globally so far.
32267081,Demographic, clinical, laboratory characteristics and outcomes were recorded.
32267081,Continuous IV anakinra infusions up to 2400 mg/day resulted in rapid serologic, then clinical response in 4/5 severely ill patients who were refractory to all other therapies including subcutaneous anakinra.
32267081,Continuous infusion of IV anakinra may result in rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with MAS.
32267098,As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, the extrapulmonary symptoms of the disease have emerged, especially the symptoms related to the digestive system.
32267098,While the respiratory mode of transmission is well-known and likely the principal mode of transmission of this disease, the possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenario.
32267110,Also, due to the growing number of infected cases, it is clear that, in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms caused by the infection, some patients suffer from cardiovascular damage.
32267531,The vision of this strict organization was to centralize patients in high-risk maternity centers in order to concentrate human resources and personal protective equipment (PPE), dedicate protected areas of these major hospitals, and centralize clinical multidisciplinary experience with this disease.
32267531,The clinical presentation was interstitial pneumonia in 20 women.
32267556,A number of novel and repurposed therapies agents with activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and most institutions have developed clinical pathways to operationalize their use in appropriate COVID-19 patients.<sup>1-3</sup> However, optimal drug therapy decisions for those with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections are extremely challenging at this time as evidence is limited.
32267613,As a consequence, many of us who undertake clinical research have seen our work suspended.
32267771,Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02735707).
32267964,Therefore, we believe non-clinical areas are potentially high-risk for transmission between healthcare workers, and often neglected by infection prevention and control protocols.
32267964,To alert others to this risk and how it may be reduced, we describe our non-clinical workplace infection prevention and control measures that have been modified from those originally developed during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic [5].
32267979,Initially, the estimate for severe cases was approximated at 5% based on experience from China.<sup>1, 2</sup> However, the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate from China for severe and critical cases is near 20% (Table).<sup>3</sup> The primary clinical feature of COVID-19 is pneumonia, the severity of which directs the clinical course; it has been estimated that, of patients admitted to the ICU, up to half may require either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support.<sup>4</sup> This has created an unprecedented situation for emergency and critical care medicine.
32267987,Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus.
32267987,Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals.
32268005,It has been reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and this finding was quickly supported by an open label non-randomized clinical trial that provided the first published clinical evidence HCQ may be a treatment option.
32268390,Here we describe the rapid rollout of capabilities by UW Medicine Information Technology Services (ITS) to support our clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide recommendations for health systems to urgently consider, as they plan their own response to this and potentially other future pandemics.
32268390,We look at how we managed expedited change control processes to quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows.
32268390,The COVID-19 response requires new and expedited ways of approaching ITS support to clinical needs.
32268390,UW Medicine ITS leadership hope that by quickly sharing our nimble response to clinical and operational requests, we can help other systems prepare to respond to this public health emergency.
32268455,The burn microbiology laboratory of the author's unit is a second-level biosafety laboratory, which is mainly responsible for handling clinical microbial samples from our department and other departments in the hospital.
32268455,The specific work flow is summarized as follows to provide reference for the safety protection of peer in clinical microbiology laboratory.
32268456,<b>Objective:</b> To study the clinical application effect of modified nasopharyngeal swab sampling for 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection. <b>Methods:</b> This study covered the period from January 14 to March 1, 2020.
32268641,This guideline is applicable to the health protection requirements of large indoor stadiums which are reconstructed as treatment sites for COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms during the outbreak.
32268643,Residents had higher awareness rate of cough (99.5%,<i>n=</i>3 997) and fever (96.0%, <i>n=</i>3 857) symptoms, the transmission by droplets (99.5%, <i>n=</i>3 995), aerosol transmission (81.1%, <i>n=</i>3 258), and contact transmission (92.3%, <i>n=</i>3 708), but lower awareness of symptoms os muscle pain or fatigue (62.7%, <i>n=</i>2 518).
32268984,Based on the current understanding of COVID-19 and the clinical characteristics of cardiovascular surgical patients, the authors provide anesthesia management guidelines for cardiovascular surgery along with the prevention and control of COVID-19.
32269086,We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.
32269086,Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients in and outside of Hubei.
32269087,Previous studies described the clinical features of Covid-19 in adults and infants under 1 year of age.
32269087,All 4 mothers were infected by SARS-CoV-2, 3 showing symptoms before and 1 after delivery.
32269087,The symptoms in newborn babies were milder and outcomes were less severe as compared to adults.
32269088,All clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, between December 25, 2019 and February 7, 2020.
32269100,In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we evaluated assays using seven different primer/probe sets and one assay kit.
32269100,These results will provide valuable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide.
32269177,Currently, only a small fraction of operators has been reassigned to provide clinical services outside their scope of practice.
32269598,There have been several reports noting anosmia and ageusia as possible symptoms of COVID-19.
32269598,This is of particular interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects.
32269598,The purpose of this report was to summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia and ageusia an emerging COVID-19 symptoms in order to better inform both oncology patients and clinicians.
32269598,Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19.
32269598,Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate.
32269598,Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.
32269893,There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization.
32269893,This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments.
32269893,The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice.
32269893,Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated.
32269893,Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19.
32269893,Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated.
32269893,Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented.
32270184,Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections.
32270359,However, to remain at home with stroke symptoms does not mean to &quot;stay safe at home&quot;.
32270371,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32270413,Clinical and epidemiological knowledge of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited.
32270413,This family comprised three laboratory confirmed cases with clinical symptoms.
32270477,In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients need to be evaluated within 2-4 weeks in the following cases: cytology result of &quot;squamous cell carcinoma,&quot; &quot;atypical glandular cells, favor neoplastic,&quot; &quot;endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ,&quot; or &quot;adenocarcinoma&quot;; histopathological diagnosis of suspected invasion from cervical/vaginal biopsy, or invasive disease after a cervical excision procedure, vaginal excision, or vulvar biopsy/excision; sudden onset of strongly suggestive symptoms for malignancy.
32270479,To study chest CT images and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant patients to examine any correlation.
32270479,Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms.
32270479,Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients' clinical and CT characteristics were performed.
32270479,Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19.
32270515,After 7 days of treatment, he was discharged with miraculous improvement in his symptoms and hemoglobin level.
32270559,Although coronavirus disease (COVID-19) clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported.
32270565,Recommendations regarding clinical practice during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were also reviewed.
32270565,Elective procedures should be postponed indefinitely, and clinical practice should be limited to patients with urgent or emergent needs.
32270565,We summarize current best-practice recommendations for Otolaryngologists to ensure safety for themselves, their clinical staff, and their patients.
32270581,A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter).
32270581,Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient.
32270581,For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases).
32270592,We reported the clinical characteristics of a case series of 10 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aged from 1 year to 18 years.
32270592,Fever (4 [40.0%]) and cough (3 [30.0%]) were the most common symptoms.
32270592,Our study indicated that COVID-19 children present less severe symptoms and have better outcomes.
32270660,<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical characteristics and liver biochemical parameters of 324 cases admitted with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Shanghai area. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical data and baseline liver biochemical parameters of 324 cases with novel coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20, 2020 to February 24, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32270660,The differences in clinical data and baseline liver biochemical parameters of the two groups were described and compared.
32270923,In a matter of weeks, the COVID19 crisis has totally upended clinical medicine and the practice of rheumatology.
32270938,This finding suggests the need for strict auto-isolation of patients until the resolution of their symptoms.
32270938,For patients that present with typical symptoms, who have a presumed Covid-19 prevalence of -40-50 %, a negative test should be interpreted with caution and a repeat test may be needed.
32271070,However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care.
32271070,In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research.
32271208,A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices.
32271208,The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic.
32271369,All the consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Fuyang second people's hospital or the fifth medical center of Chinese PLA general hospital between January 20 and February 22, 2020, were enrolled and their clinical data were retrospectively collected.
32271454,Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19.
32271456,In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.
32271459,The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32271460,68 (37.2%) epidemiology, 49 (26.8%) virology and 26 (14.2%) clinical features.
32271490,In most cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms.
32271596,We present four patients in this study, selected from among patients who presented with pneumonia symptoms and were suspicious for COVID-19.
32271601,The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection.
32271602,To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China.
32271602,To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19.
32271602,Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed.
32271602,No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P &gt; 0.05).
32271602,The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas.
32271650,At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, they were divided into two groups: (1) the experimental group (combined mode of MOOC micro-video) and (2) the control group (traditional theory teaching combined with clinical practice teaching).
32271722,Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred.
32271722,Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19.
32271724,At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1).
32271724,For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers.
32271726,On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later.
32271726,The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved.
32271728,Data from China suggest that pediatric COVID-19 cases might be less severe than cases in adults and that children might experience different symptoms than do adults (4,5); however, disease characteristics among pediatric patients in the United States have not been described.
32271728,Data were available for a small proportion of patients on many important variables, including symptoms (9.4%), underlying conditions (13%), and hospitalization status (33%).
32271728,Among those with available information, 73% of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath compared with 93% of adults aged 18-64 years during the same period; 5.7% of all pediatric patients, or 20% of those for whom hospitalization status was known, were hospitalized, lower than the percentages hospitalized among all adults aged 18-64 years (10%) or those with known hospitalization status (33%).
32271728,Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission (6,7).
32271861,Cross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study. 5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. 630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic conditions.
32271861,Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%).
32271947,Few case reports and clinical series exist on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered.
32271947,The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes.
32271993,In this retrospective cohort study we analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2, in a single French center.
32272080,Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission.
32272173,We also provide a supplemental file containing background information on the biology, epidemiology, and clinical features of all human-infecting coronaviruses, along with a phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses.

32272262,Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
32272480,0.4%; p &lt; 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs.
32272480,They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p ≤ 0.01).
32272480,Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01).
32272480,Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p &lt; 0.01 or 0.05).
32272480,Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &lt; 0.01 or 0.05).
32272481,In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>).
32272481,Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup>.
32272481,Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.
32272857,Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks.
32273156,Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection.
32273245,Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners could consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available).
32273245,Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).
32273253,Based on the method of evidence-based pharmacy, clinical evidence of therapeutical drugs for COVID-19 were retrieved and summarized.
32273253,Based on clinical experience Chinese hospital pharmacists gained from providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic, taking COVID-19 hospitalized patients' needs into consideration, the methods and strategies hospital pharmacists shall use to provide pharmaceutical care were analyzed and summarized.
32273490,Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute to transmission.
32274341,The clinical features and outcomes of Chinese patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported.
32274341,The clinical, pathological and laboratory characteristics as well as underlying pathophysiology and etiology of liver injury in COVID-19 remain largely unclear.
32274342,Based on the current evidence from case reports and case series, this review article focuses on the demographic and clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and treatment options for COVID-19-related liver dysfunction.
32274617,Here, we briefly review the virus, its structure and evolution, epidemiology and pathogenesis, immunogenicity and immune, and clinical response in older adults, using available knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its highly pathogenic relatives MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1.
32274617,We conclude by discussing clinical and basic science approaches to protect older adults against this disease.
32274771,We sought to provide a clinical practice protocol for our labor and delivery (L&amp;D) unit, to care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients requiring cesarean delivery.
32274773,In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 - 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy.
32274774,In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19 patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported.
32274787,We have recently observed several clusters of psychiatric symptoms in the context of COVID-19: (1) increased anxiety in psychiatric in- and outpatients with different diagnoses; (2) more cases of domestic violence often associated with increased drug- or alcohol-consumption in offenders and victims; (3) a nihilistic &quot;apocalyptic&quot; syndrome of elderly patients cut-off from their families; (4) visual and acoustic hallucinoses due to pneumonia and sepsis-related confusional states.
32274879,The urology residents do not have the opportunity to carry out clinical activities nor to be tutored, as the senior physicians are engaged in the emergency's management.
32275074,Here were reported clinical features of silent infected COVID-19 patients.
32275124,Working in a clinical laboratory is posing several safety challenges.
32275128,The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32275257,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), spreading from Wuhan, China, is one of the causes of respiratory infections that can spread to other people through respiratory particles, and can cause symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anorexia, fatigue and sore throat in infected patients.
32275258,Early available clinical data have indicated that geriatric persons cum those with comorbidity such as cardiovascular, metabolic and immunological disorders suffered severe form of COVID-19.
32275259,So, this review aims at understanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses.
32275288,Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue.
32275288,Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists.
32275288,Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough.
32275347,We describe the first case of acute cardiac injury directly linked to myocardial localization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a 69-year-old patient with flu-like symptoms rapidly degenerating into respiratory distress, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock.
32275452,We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, CT images and treatment of COVID-19 patients from three different cities in China. 476 patients were recruited from Jan 1 to Feb 15, 2020 at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai and Anhui.
32275740,The emphasis is on maintaining clinical efficacy and safety by increasing the dose per fraction while reducing the number of daily treatments.
32275740,The guidance is informed by adhering to acceptable radiobiological parameters and clinical tolerability.
32275766,This narrative review provides a summary of evidence and clinical guidance for the use and interpretation of lung ultrasound for patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 associated lung injury.
32275766,Mechanisms by which the potential lung ultrasound workforce can be deployed are explored, including a pragmatic approach to training, governance, imaging, interpretation of images and implementation of lung ultrasound into routine clinical practice.
32275784,Evidence strongly supports that access to specialty gastroenterology or hepatology care in cirrhosis is associated with higher adherence to guideline-recommended care and improves clinical outcomes.
32275784,Telemedicine, defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means for diagnosis and treatment, holds tremendous promise to increase access to broadly specialty care.
32275792,The common symptoms include a dry continuous cough, fever and shortness of breath; severe cases involve pneumonia which may require ventilatory support.
32275805,This perspective article draws on qualitative data from a longitudinal, ethnographic study of an Australian tertiary ED to illustrate the clinical and ethical challenges faced by EDs during PHEs.
32275812,This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.
32275812,In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%).
32275914,Type 1 interferons have a broad antiviral activity in vitro and are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat MERS-CoV.
32275914,In this review, we discuss preliminary data concerning the potential activity of type 1 interferons on SARS-CoV-2, and the relevance of evaluating these molecules in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.
32275978,Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.
32276095,The present study aims to investigate the symptoms and causes of SSD of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia.
32276095,Exploratory factor analysis was performed to cluster the symptoms, and logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors of the symptoms.
32276095,Five major symptoms were chest-discomfort-and-palpitation (31.4%), dyspnea (30.7%), nausea (21.4%), headache (19.3%), and dizziness (17.9%).
32276095,In exploratory factor analysis, the symptoms were classified into three clusters: Cluster A of breathing and sleep disturbances (dizziness, sleepiness, dyspnea); Cluster B of gastrointestinal complaints and pain (nausea, headache), and Cluster C of general symptoms (xerostomia, fatigue, chest-discomfort-and-palpitation).
32276099,We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider.
32276099,We recommend active triaging, communication, frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting.
32276102,Symptom management and skilled communication with patients and families are essential clinical services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32276102,It is imperative that all clinicians responding to the COVID-19 crisis have access to clinical tools to support symptom management and difficult patient and family communication.
32276116,To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32276116,These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples.
32276137,Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death.
32276139,Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a 47-year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan.
32276196,Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression.
32276282,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast and is affecting the clinical workers at much higher risk than the general population.
32276333,In a containment-based strategy, rapid, sensitive and specific testing is important in epidemiological control and clinical management.
32276333,Evaluation of the new assay using 59 clinical specimens from 14 confirmed cases showed 100% concordance with our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel reference assay.
32276848,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected.
32277018,From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice.
32277203,Major and rapid reorganisation of both clinical and support services is not straightforward.
32277351,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clinical syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32277367,• Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.
32277387,In this article, we reviewed the clinical aspects of 2019-nCoV infection, characteristics of liver transplant recipients, immunosuppressant usage, and potential drug interactions to provide recommendations to clinical staff managing liver transplant recipients during the COVID-19 epidemic.
32277408,A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms.
32277555,The clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterized, clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure，no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist.
32277555,Further data are needed to achieve better understanding of the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical presentation, severity and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections in solid organ transplant recipients.
32277591,Liver injury is common in patients with COVID-19, but little is known about its clinical presentation and severity in the context of liver transplantation.
32277591,The patient came to clinic with symptoms of respiratory disease; pharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were positive.
32277751,In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation.
32277751,Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom.
32277759,Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspect Covid-19 cases.
32277763,Clinical care must be provided to help our patients in a timely manner, while keeping them, health care personnel and the community safe.
32277763,However, each referral must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the clinical situation will evolve over time, necessitating flexibility in managing EDX triaging.
32277836,The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care.
32277967,All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020.
32278065,Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea.
32278065,Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.
32278065,It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms.
32278175,Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response.
32278670,Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission.
32278693,In the present study, 61 molecules that are already being used in clinics or under clinical scrutiny as antiviral agents are surveyed via docking study.
32278716,In the midst of a global pandemic of a novel infectious disease, reality-based considerations comprise an important starting point for formulating clinical management pathways.
32278725,The decision to proceed with Medically-Necessary, Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making.
32278764,We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;pathogenesis&quot;, &quot;incubation period&quot;, &quot;transmission&quot;, &quot;clinical features&quot;, &quot;diagnosis&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, with interposition of the Boolean operator &quot;AND&quot;.
32278764,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death.
32278764,Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.
32278766,Clinical pharmacists' routine task is carrying out pharmaceutical care to ensure patients' safe and reasonable medication use.
32278766,However, under public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, the work strategies of clinical pharmacists need to be modified according to the rapid spread of the disease, where information and resources are usually lack to guide them.
32278766,To retrieve and investigate the prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists during the outbreak of novel coronavirus, summarize the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists, and to propose innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services under the epidemic.
32278766,The Chinese and English databases, self-media network, website of professional society or medical institution, and clinical trial center platforms were searched, and clinical pharmacists involved in the work against COVID-19 were surveyed and interviewed.
32278766,Clinical pharmacists play a vital role in leading the industry to formulate work instructions, provide frontline medical staff with drug information, and develop innovative pharmacy services to promote the rational use of medicines with collaborative teamwork and close communication according to the epidemic situation of COVID-19.
32278766,Facing public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists can give full play to their professional expertise, analyze the current situation rationally, formulate telehealth strategies swiftly, and work in a united and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services to ensure medication safety and rational use of medicine.

32287082,COVID-19 may also risk the financial underpinnings of AMCs because their cost structures are high, and they may have incurred large amounts of debt over the last decade as they expanded their clinical operations and facilities.
32287140,Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus.
32287140,In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.
32287140,All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.
32287140,Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).
32287140,Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).
32287140,In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.
32287140,As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.
32287140,Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.
32287140,We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19.
32287140,Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.
32289016,Clinical evidence is needed in the future to evaluate the efficacy of traditional medicine.
32289038,Based on 33 articles published by Chinese scholars, guidelines and clinical practice experience in domestic hospitals, we have summarized the Chinese experience through the lens of ophthalmology, hoping to make a contribution to protecting ophthalmologists and patients around the world.
32289263,Compared with a clinical isolate, the infectious-clone-derived SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2) exhibited similar plaque morphology, viral RNA profile, and replication kinetics.
32289466,A total of 102 patients (48 Male [47%] and 54 Female [53%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32289516,Clinical information on patients contracted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the perioperative period is limited.
32289516,Fever, lymphopenia and ground-glass opacities on computerized tomography (CT) are the most common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients after lung resection surgery.
32289548,We conducted an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU).
32289565,To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China.
32289565,Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020.
32289565,Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)].
32289791,Using Richardson and Davidson's model and the sciences of pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacopsychology, this article reviewed the: (1) poor life expectancy associated with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), which may be improved in patients who adhere to clozapine; (2) findings that clozapine is the best treatment for TRS (according to efficacy, effectiveness and well-being); and (3) potential for clozapine to cause vulnerabilities, including potentially lethal adverse drug reactions such as agranulocytosis, pneumonia, and myocarditis.
32289791,Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose.
32289791,If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it.
32290293,In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.
32290293,We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation.
32290293,We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
32290293,The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including <i>favipiravir</i>, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and <i>hydroxychloroquine</i>, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway.
32290348,This short communication focuses on four treatments recommended by WHO and included in the first clinical trial of the European Discovery project.
32290644,The objective of this work is to report the initial experience with epidemiologic and clinical features, as well as with the management of COVID-19 patients in India.
32290644,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including age, sex, nationality, travel history, symptoms, duration of stay, and comorbidities.
32290644,The most common symptoms were fever and cough (42.9%) followed by sore throat, headache and breathlessness.
32290644,Among the first 21 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in India, the typical clinical presentation consisted in a mild upper respiratory tract infection predominantly affecting the young male population.
32290644,All patients recovered with no residual symptoms.
32290839,Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved.
32291112,Hundreds of clinical studies have been registered with the intention of discovering effective treatments.
32291112,Here, we review currently registered interventional clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to provide an overall summary and insight into the global response.
32291137,We propose to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade to manage COVID-19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application.
32291207,We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes.
32291207,The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus.
32291207,The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.
32291351,There is no approved drug or vaccine for COVID-19, although more than 10 clinical trials have been launched to test potential drugs.
32291365,In late 2019, a mass of patients showing symptoms of a pneumonia-like disease of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan, China.
32291373,During the pandemic, physicians may need to raise the index of suspicion earlier in at-risk patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, which are uncommon findings in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
32291373,We report a patient in Indonesia with chest pain and gastrointestinal symptoms who was later confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection after spending days of hospitalisation in the standard ward.
32291374,The objective of this case study is to investigate the importance and utility of chest computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19, as increasing pieces of evidence suggest that chest CT could prove useful in the clinical pathway in diagnosing COVID-19.
32291376,COVID-19 symptom is highly various in each patient, with fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cough as the main presenting symptoms.
32291382,Various challenges associated with developing a vaccine during the pandemic such as technological hurdles, clinical development pathways, regulatory issues, and support from global funding agencies are expressed here.
32291501,This review is mainly about the differences in clinical symptom spectrum, diagnosis of COVID-19, and CT imaging findings between adults and children, while highlighting the value of radiology in prevention and control of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.
32291501,KEY POINTS: • Compared with adults, pediatric patients with COVID-19 have the characteristics of lower incidence, slighter clinical symptoms, shorter course of disease, and fewer severe cases.
32291502,CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed.
32291502,The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%).
32291505,The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32291542,In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.
32292012,<b>Objective:</b> Todiscuss the the effects, indications and protective measures of tracheotomy for severe cases of 2019 novel corona virus disease(COVID-19)patients. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospectively analyze was conducted to explore the clinical data of ofCOVID-19 patients who received tracheotomy in February to March 2020,descriptive statistics were used to analyze the indication of tracheotomy, particularity of intraoperative treatment and protective measures. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4 cases were included in this article, 3 cases were successfully operated, 1 case of postoperative incision continuous bleeding, there were not other complications and nosocomial infection among the medical staff.the patient's condition was relieved in different degrees after the operation, who remain hospitalized. <b>Conclusion:</b> Tracheotomy for severe cases of COVID-19 can achieve certain curative effect, but the occurrence of tracheotomy related complicationsand nosocomial infection should be effectively controlled, and the risk benefit ratio of tracheotomy should be carefully weighed before surgery. <b>目的：</b> 探讨新型冠状病毒肺炎危重型患者施行气管切开术的指征、术中处理的特殊性及防护措施。
32292205,General demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were collected that had been reported on the websites of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China.
32292213,The clinical course of the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung failure.
32292213,Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time and a number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing.
32292300,Symptoms of COVID-2019 include cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
32292300,Primary care providers must be alert to respiratory symptoms they encounter that are associated with pertinent travel history, be prepared to safely screen, examine and possibly test and/or report suspicions to the health department for further evaluation.
32292517,The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020.
32292517,Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated.
32292517,The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. <b>Results:</b> Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type.
32292517,The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment.
32292529,We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world.
32292529,We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline.
32292529,Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses.
32292587,The highly prevalence of COVID-19 is due to the lack onset of symptoms.
32292587,Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.
32292626,Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out.
32292626,This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues.
32292626,A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors.
32292626,Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool.
32292626,A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected.
32292626,After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID).
32292626,The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function).
32292626,The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making.
32292627,MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial.
32292627,Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies.
32292633,It is found that the existence, relatedness, and growth needs coexist in clinical nurses.
32292634,This scientific and practical consensus guideline can provide clinical guidance on the holistic nursing care of patients with severe COVID-19.
32292686,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32292689,In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed.
32292689,This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32292802,We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness.
32292802,Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results.
32292826,Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, a strong response from the research community has been observed with the proliferation of independent clinical trials assessing diagnostic methods, therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.
32292826,While there is no intervention for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 with proven clinical efficacy to date, tools to distil the current research landscape by intervention, level of evidence and those studies likely powered to address future research questions is essential.
32292826,This living systematic review aims to provide an open, accessible and frequently updated resource summarising the characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trial registrations.
32292826,Weekly search updates of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and source registries will be conducted.
32292826,This living systematic review will provide a useful resource of COVID-19 clinical trial registrations for researchers in a rapidly evolving context.
32292837,Adopted preventive measures and recommendations are highlighted for patients, professionals and clinical operations to minimize the risk of infection while safely treating cancer patients.
32292839,Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease.
32292839,Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary.
32292839,Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease.
32292842,In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes.
32292847,Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment.
32292847,Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios.
32292848,We review the most current data with a focus on our basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics.
32292848,We discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multi-organ consequences, and outcomes.
32292866,During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7-10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy.
32292866,Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, in order to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.
32292880,In order to know about the progress and prospective on imaging of COVID-19, this review focus on interpreting the CT findings, stating the potential pathological basis, proposing the challenge of patients with underlying diseases, differentiating with other diseases and suggesting the future research and clinical directions, which would be helpful for the radiologists in the clinical practice and research.
32292881,Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality.
32292899,We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes.
32292899,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020.
32292899,Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU.
32292901,Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease.
32292902,An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%).
32292902,None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission.
32292902,There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission.
32292903,Fourteen (32.6%) patients presented without any COVID-associated viral symptoms, and were identified either after developing symptoms during admission or following the implementation of universal testing for all obstetrical admissions on March 22.
32292903,Of these, 10/14 (71.4%) developed symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge.
32292903,Of the other 29 (67.4%) patients who presented with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, three women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and an additional patient represented six days postpartum after a successful labor induction with worsening respiratory status that required oxygen supplementation.
32292904,This report describes the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in an in-center hemodialysis patient, as well as our experience in implementing steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pneumonia among in-center hemodialysis patients.
32292906,We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.
32292908,The capacity and capabilities of global producers to meet the potential demand for treating patients inflicted with COVID-19 by the novel corona virus</i> SARS-CoV-2<i>, should HCQ's efficacy be established by more definitive clinical trials, is also assessed.
32293003,We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.
32293018,Whilst it usually takes 10-15 years to develop a vaccine, it has only taken just over 9 weeks from the publication of the viral genetic sequence for the first vaccine candidate to reach clinical testing.
32293018,Development has been expediated by using existing technological platforms and by performing preclinical and clinical testing simultaneously.
32293020,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe respiratory failure and distressing symptoms including fever, cough, breathlessness and anxiety.
32293098,Most patients have mild to moderate symptoms, but a subgroup will become severely ill.
32293168,Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples.
32293168,Our FET device could detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/ml in PBS and 100 fg/ml clinical transport medium.
32293168,In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 x 10<sup>1</sup> pfu/ml) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 x 10<sup>2</sup> copies/ml).
32293224,The current COVID-19 crisis continues to grow and has resulted in marked changes to clinical operations.
32293224,In parallel with clinical preparedness, universities have shut down the majority of scientific research activities.
32293709,With this letter, we proposed a hypothesis that could explain the interaction between HIV infection and the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32293713,A handful of literatures have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas therapies for COVID-19 are rather limited.
32293713,The efficacy of this intervention was determined by the alleviation of symptoms, changes in radiologic abnormalities and laboratory tests.
32293714,In clinical practice, not only fever and respiratory tract symptoms but also multiple organ symptoms are observed in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32293714,Herein, we report a rare case of a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 who manifested with concomitant neurological symptoms.
32293714,The patient developed fever and respiratory symptoms at disease onset, followed by muscle soreness, and subsequently altered consciousness and psychiatric symptoms, with positive signs based on neurological examination.
32293714,This rare case indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system, thus causing neurological symptoms and signs.
32293716,We aim to systematically review the clinical characteristics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32293716,Seven datebases were searched to collect studies about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2020.
32293716,Fever (80.4%), fatigue (46%), cough (63.1%) and expectoration (41.8%) were the most common clinical manifestations.
32293716,Other common symptoms included muscle soreness (33%), anorexia (38.8%), chest tightness (35.7%), shortness of breath (35%), dyspnea (33.9%).
32293716,Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.9%), headache (15.4%), pharyngalgia(13.1%), shivering (10.9%) and abdominal pain (4.4%).
32293716,The most commonly experienced symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever, fatigue, cough and expectoration.
32293741,This retrospective study aimed to analysis the clinical characteristics and complications in death cases with novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
32293741,We collected the medical records of 92 patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University who died during January 6th to February 25th, 2020, summarized the clinical characteristics of complications.
32293807,We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials.
32293807,Three databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID-19 treated with antiretrovirals.
32293807,From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment.
32293807,In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID-19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant.
32293807,On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID-19.
32293817,In this paper we share the early experiences from the clinical field in Northern Italy, where the epidemic started in February.
32293832,Seven coronavirus species are known to cause human infection, four of which, HCoV 229E, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1 and HCoV OC43, typically cause cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals.
32293834,There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, various antiviral and immunomodulating agents are in various stages of evaluation for COVID-19 in those trials and some of them will be published in the next couple of months.
32293910,Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome.
32293910,The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction.
32294051,We developed a triplex, real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 that maintained clinical performance compared with singleplex assays.
32294179,Here we review the basic and clinical science spanning the intersections of diabetes, coronavirus infections, ACE2, and DPP4 biology, highlighting clinical relevance and evolving areas of uncertainty underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of T2D in the context of coronavirus infection.
32294264,In a recent review on clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, rash was observed in 0,2% of cases<sup>2</sup> .
32294270,Current researches emphasize on understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features, and risk factors for infection, but the data remain limited.
32294271,Recalcati noted that 20.4 % of the patients have cutaneous problem and mentioned that this is the first report on this clinical aspect of COVID-19.
32294273,Many clinical manifestations of this virus are described and new symptoms are emerging particularly outside respiratory sphere, such as anosmia and ageusia which are recent ORL published symptoms.
32294285,The authors found that abnormalities of liver function tests are common in COVID-19 patients, but the clinically significant liver dysfunction in COVID-19 was not a prominent feature of this illness and also may not have serious clinical consequences.
32294297,Due to this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients' needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementation science research.
32294485,Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited.
32294503,This study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19.
32294503,These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms.
32294503,They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed.
32294503,The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women.
32294504,Aimed to characterize the CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32294504,The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed. 58 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between Jan 1, 2020 and Feb 23, 2020 were enrolled.
32294504,On admission, patients had no symptoms and laboratory findings were normal.
32294504,After short-term follow-up, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms with lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP, mainly including fever, cough and fatigue.
32294617,Undoubtedly, healthcare providers have had to rapidly alter care delivery models while simultaneously acknowledging the crucial unknowns of how these changes may affect clinical outcomes.
32294667,The rapid increase in clinical cases of the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, suggests high transmissibility.
32294713,The sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults aged 18-78 years, who answered the Big Five Inventory 2 Short (BFI-2-S) and factors from the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2).
32294796,This study was conducted to explore the clinical value of noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of lung lesions of Coronavirus Disease-19.
32294796,The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated.
32294796,Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.
32294807,At present, there are no studies demonstrating the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32294814,COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory infection disease, which leads to dysfunction of respiratory, physical, and psychological of the patients. pulmonary rehabilitation is an important intervention for clinical patients as well as cure patients.
32294814,With the deeper cognition of COVID-19 and accumulation of clinical experience, we proposed the recommendations for pulmonary rehabilitation of COVID-19 in adults based on the opinions of front-line clinical experts involved in the management of this epidemic and a review of the relevant literature and evidences: (1)for the inpatients with COVID-19, pulmonary rehabilitation would relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression; eventually improve physical function and the quality of life; (2)For severe/critical inpatients, the early performance of pulmonary rehabilitation is not suggested.
32294814,These recommendations can serve as a clinical practice guidence and basis for pulmonary rehabilitation of COVID-19.
32294816,The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs.
32294816,Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients.
32294817,The experience and knowledge we gained from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially with regard to the time course of viral replication, host immune response and clinical progression of the patient, may provide important insights into understanding and management of COVID-19.
32294817,Clinical deterioration accompanied by decreasing viral load in the second week after symptom onset was noted both in SARS and COVID-19, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to excessive host immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication.
32294858,There were 3 cases of mild type, 27 cases of common type and 3 cases of severe type.There were 2 cases with hypertension, 1 case with postoperative lung,1 case with diabetes, 1 case with chronic bronchitis, and 1 case with bronchiectasis.SPSS25.0 Chi-square test was used to analyze the distribution of lesions in each lung lobe; SPSS25.0 Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the image score and clinical classification. <b>Results:</b> There were 3 cases (9.1%) with normal lung and 30 cases (90.9%) with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(COVID-19) of the 2019-nCoV infected patients.
32294858,The correlation coefficient between the degree of lesion distribution and clinical classification was 0.819, and the two were highly correlated.There were 30 cases (90.9%) with subpleural lesions, 17 cases (51.5%) with central lesions.
32295153,Plant-based vaccines are a technology with proven viability, which have led to promising results for candidates evaluated at the clinical level, meaning this technology could contribute towards the fight against COVID-19.
32295188,In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and preparedness.

32295322,After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was 12±4 days. <b>Conclusion:</b> A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases.
32295324,Eighty-one patients diagnosed as coronavirus disease-19 in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Hospital were enrolled with ophthalmological consultation screening for novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis, including the inquiring of eye symptoms and checking for conjunctivitis-related signs.
32295324,Conjunctival swab novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed on patients with clinical manifestation of conjunctivitis. <b>Results:</b> Only 3 of the 81 patients (3.70%) complained of eye discomfort, which appeared on the day 16.67±9.29 after the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19.
32295324,Screening of clinical symptoms and signs of conjunctivitis in the remaining 78 patients showed no significant abnormalities. <b>Conclusions:</b> There wasn't any novel coronavirus related conjunctivitis in 81 patients with coronavirus disease-19.<i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:)</i>. <b>目的：</b> 探讨新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者新型冠状病毒相关性结膜炎的患病情况。
32295460,Three main aspects are discussed, namely clinical, administrative, and training and educational.
32295661,In particular, the majority of patients that are currently tested in Italy have severe clinical symptoms that usually require hospitalization and this translates to a large CFR.
32295662,Finally, 28 had evidence-based clinical processes and operations.
32295811,Every month, DTB scans sources of information on treatments, disease management and other healthcare topics for key items to bring to our readers' attention and help them keep up to date.
32296046,Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring.
32296473,The initial clinical presentation of CoronaVirus Disease 2019 may be appendicular syndrome.
32296808,We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation.
32296817,Investigators are employing unprecedented innovation in the design of clinical trials to rapidly and rigorously assess potentially promising therapies for COVID-19; this is in stark contrast to the continued near universal regressive practice of exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from these trials.
32296824,Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.
32296884,Here, we summarize our American College of Nuclear Medicine members' experiences from Wuhan, China; Singapore; and the USA, so to provide advice to the nuclear medicine personnel for their clinical practice and management strategies in responding to COVID-19.
32296888,Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.
32296910,We propose several mechanisms by which coronavirus disease 2019 causes thrombocytopenia to better understand this disease and provide more clinical treatment options.
32296940,Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial.
32296940,Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
32296940,• Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.
32297540,The clinical and laboratory data of 383 patients with the definite outcome by March 1, 2020 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan were reviewed.
32297727,The Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale/algorithm is a stepwise management approach to COVID-19 patients based on clinical severity.
32297727,The scale simplifies the clinical summary of a patient's status, and allows clinicians to compare patients to one another and to track the trend of a patient's level of respiratory severity over time.
32297828,The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed.
32297980,Based on our data, disease management in the 2 weeks following the first reported cases is of utmost importance.
32297981,At present, it mainly relies on Real-time RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid collected from the clinical specimens of patients as the standard for diagnosis, discontinuation of quarantine and discharge.<sup>1,2</sup> This article is protected by copyright.
32297985,Information including age, gender and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated.
32297985,The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed.
32297985,At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms and main laboratory results.
32297985,At discharge, 7/184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leucocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission.
32297985,In addition, the results of chest CT imaging, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests at discharge were not completely consistent.
32297988,Following the demonstration of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro, many trials started to evaluate its efficacy in clinical settings.
32297988,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of &quot;time to clinical cure,&quot; &quot;virological cure,&quot; &quot;death or clinical worsening of disease,&quot; &quot;radiological progression,&quot; and safety.
32297988,In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in &quot;time to body temperature normalization&quot; and one study reported less &quot;cough days&quot; in the HCQ arm.
32297988,No difference was observed in virological cure (OR, 2.37, 95% CI, 0.13-44.53), death or clinical worsening of disease (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.37-21.97), and safety (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 0.59-8.18), when compared with the control/conventional treatment.
32297995,In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate whether the IL-6/IFN-γ ratio can help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19.
32298029,In this context, in Italy, we reorganized the National Health System and prioritized the clinical cancer care scenario, balancing risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission versus the magnitude of clinical benefit deriving from a specific therapeutic approach.
32298036,Finally, we discuss our preoperative clinical pathway for transmission mitigation including defining low-risk and high-risk surgery for transmission and role of preoperative COVID-19 testing.
32298146,Multiple areas of surge planning progressed, simultaneously focused on infection control, clinical operational challenges, ICU surge capacity, staffing, ethics, and maintenance of staff wellness.
32298146,The protocols developed focused on clinical decisions regarding intubation, the use of high-flow oxygen, engagement with infectious disease consultants, and cardiac arrest.
32298146,Support was provided for both clinical and nonclinical staff affected by the profound impact COVID-19 had on our city.
32298247,Although 4,336 (92%) HCP patients reported having at least one symptom among fever, cough, or shortness of breath, the remaining 8% did not report any of these symptoms.
32298249,Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States.
32298251,This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance.
32298251,In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5).
32298251,Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.
32298273,And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.
32298473,Our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers.
32298480,FDA/EMA-approved monitoring guidelines, clinical practice guidelines, and relevant, up-to-date publications regarding initiation and monitoring of beta-blocker therapy were used to inform the recommendations.
32298480,Clinical decision-making guidelines about when telehealth is an appropriate alternative to in-office visits, including medication initiation, dosage changes, and ongoing evaluation, are included.
32298643,In this article, the authors share several operational guidelines and strategies implemented in our practice to reduce spread of COVID-19 and maintain clinical and educational needs of a teaching hospital.
32298676,This study analyzed salivary samples of COVID-19 patients and compared the results with their clinical and laboratory data.
32298676,Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered.
32298676,The role of saliva in COVID-19 diagnosis could not be limited to a qualitative detection of the virus, but it may also provide information about the clinical evolution of the disease.
32298686,All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized.
32298686,Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection).
32298745,The patient avoided mechanical ventilation and acquired an immediate clinical and radiological improvement, after treatment of intensive plasma exchange (PE) followed by intravenous immunogloblin (IVIG).
32298745,What's more, it may improve poor clinical outcomes of these patients.
32298767,We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results.
32298767,Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020.
32298767,Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis.
32298769,This includes an intensification of the preventative care provided to patients with compensated cirrhosis, proactive chronic disease management, robust telehealth programs, and a reorganization of care delivery to provide a full service of care with flexible clinical staffing.
32298802,This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19.
32298802,IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event.
32298802,Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (&gt;24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant.
32298803,Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients.
32298988,There is a need to study the clinical features of patients in a hospital near Wuhan.
32298988,To identify clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital near Wuhan.
32298988,General information, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and computed tomography (CT) data were collected for 225 patients diagnosed of COVID-19 admitted between January 20 and February 14, 2020, to the Hanchuan City People's Hospital.
32298988,The major clinical symptoms were fever (84.44% of patients), cough (56.44% of patients), and dyspnea (4.00% of patients); 3.56%-22.67% of subjects suffered from expectoration, fatigue, chills, headache, chest pain, and pharyngalgia.
32298988,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the tertiary hospital near Wuhan are very similar to those found in Wuhan, but the lower mortality.
32299017,Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.
32299200,The symptoms are undiagnostic, the results of viral nucleic acid detection method (PCR) can delay, so that chest computerized tomography is often key diagnostic test in patients with possible COVID-19 pneumonia.
32299205,Therefore, how to ensure the triage of the patient with acute respiratory symptoms should be determined in advance, the contact distance should be arranged to be at least 2 m, COVID-19 suspect or diagnosed patient should be instructed to wear a surgical mask.
32299206,Last human coronavirus which emerged world from Wuhan China, SARS CoV-2 and its clinical expression, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recently taken a significant place in our daily practice.
32299304,These results support the CAS as an efficient and valid tool for clinical research and practice.
32299636,Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described.
32299636,There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection.
32299636,Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms.
32299752,At present, Canada has more than 8000 cases of COVID-19, with considerable variation in rates of infection among provinces and territories.<sup>3</sup> Amid concerns over growing resource constraints, cardiac surgeons from across Canada have been forced to make drastic changes to their clinical practices.
32300245,We validated our method using contrived reference samples and clinical samples from patients in the United States, including 36 patients with COVID-19 infection and 42 patients with other viral respiratory infections.
32300370,While many younger people experience no or mild symptoms on infection, older adults are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and systemic conditions which demand a full understanding and leveraging of knowledge of the differences between immunity in young and old people.
32300496,In December 2019, several patients from Wuhan, China were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of pneumonia.
32300496,As the number of patients presenting with similar symptoms started to rise, the causative agent was eventually isolated from samples.
32300516,While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection.
32300673,The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.
32300971,We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone.
32300971,Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression.
32300971,Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram.
32300971,Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different.
32300971,The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits.
32300971,Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.
32300971,A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32300971,• Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.
32300971,• A diagnostic model for COVID-19 was developed and validated using radiological semantic and clinical features, which had an area under the curve value of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) and 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.
32301099,We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment.
32301099,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared.
32301099,Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters.
32301099,Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases.
32301099,Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03).
32301099,The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
32301155,The clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after solid organ transplant (SOT) remain unknown.
32301155,After a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset, 30.8% (4/13) of survivors developed progressive respiratory failure, 7.7% (1/13) showed stable clinical condition or improvement, and 61.5% (8/13) had been discharged home.
32301198,Here, we report the clinical features and our treatment approach for a kidney transplant patient with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32301206,With clinical placement and exams cancelled, we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way, to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime.
32301284,The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing.
32301300,A walk-through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID-19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.
32301390,Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants.
32301508,Several systematic reviews (SRs) have been conducted on the COVID-19 outbreak, which together with the SRs on previous coronavirus outbreaks, form important sources of evidence for clinical decision and policy making.
32301600,While in most cases, mild symptoms are observed, in some cases the infection leads to serious pulmonary disease.
32301600,Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks.
32301631,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> This series of patients presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain, without the respiratory symptoms typical of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the abdominal radiologist was the first to suggest COVID-19 infection because of findings in the lung bases on CT of the abdomen. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> COVID-19 infection can present primarily with abdominal symptoms, and the abdominal radiologist must suggest the diagnosis when evaluating the lung bases for typical findings.
32301647,Patients with negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasal-pharyngeal swabs, negative chest CT, and incomplete clinical data were excluded.
32301647,Clinical parameters included demographics, comorbidities, symptoms and symptom duration, oxygen saturation and laboratory values.
32301647,Logistic regression was used to evaluate relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (ICU admission/death vs. no ICU admission/ death).
32301647,In comparison with clinical model containing only clinical parameters (AUC, 0.83), all three quantitative models showed higher diagnostic performance (AUC 0.86 for all models).
32301647,The models containing %V-WAL&lt;73% and VOL-WAL&lt;2.9L were superior in terms of performance as compared to the models containing only clinical parameters (<i>P</i>=0.04 for both models).
32301692,While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation.
32301746,In addition, the need of certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel led many countries to limit the rRT-PCR tests only to individuals with pronounced respiratory syndrome symptoms.
32301746,Methods We analyzed the plasma levels of white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 207 patients who, after being admitted to the emergency room of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19 symptoms, were rRT-PCR tested.
32301749,The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from mild to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32301749,Methods The imprecision of the MAGLUMI™ 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM and IgG assays (Snibe, Shenzhen, China) was assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A3 protocol.
32301761,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat.
32301761,However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease.
32301761,In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity.
32301761,We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms.
32301761,We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms.
32301761,There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone.
32301761,Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course.
32301761,Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P &lt; 0.001).
32301761,Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms.
32301761,We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms.
32301761,These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.
32301764,This consensus statement provides information on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, advice for neuroanesthesia clinical practice during emergent neurosurgery, interventional radiology (excluding endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke), transnasal neurosurgery, awake craniotomy and electroconvulsive therapy, as well as information about healthcare provider wellness.

32304435,This short review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on a cancer patient and discuss management options and recommendation in addition to highlighting the currently available clinical guidelines and resources.
32304509,Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults.
32304509,Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19.
32304747,Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARBs may be included as additional therapy for COVID-19 patients.
32304772,The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.
32304772,The proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.
32304822,The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness.
32304994,Fever (83.8%) and cough (70.9%) were the two most common symptoms.
32304994,The binary logistic analysis identified elevated NLR (hazard risk [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98-4.57) and age (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.65-4.83) as independent factors for poor clinical outcome of COVID-19.
32304994,Elevated age and NLR can be considered independent biomarkers for indicating poor clinical outcomes.

32305249,Less common symptoms included headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
32305249,The case demonstrate that gastrointestinal symptoms ware not rare in NCIP, and diarrhea could be the initial symptom.
32305287,Here we describe the case of a young woman presenting with severe pulmonary embolism, without any associated symptoms of infections.
32305287,Despite emergency surgical embolectomy, her clinical conditions continued to deteriorate.
32305359,The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population.
32305359,In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature.
32305359,As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients.
32305359,The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies.
32305506,We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak.
32305587,Based on our experience, further clinical studies are recommended for COVID-19 PEP.
32305589,Some counties are against the use of these drugs because of adverse effects associated with drug repurposing and lack of statistically significant clinical data but they were found to be effective in some countries to treat affected COVID-19 patients (Off label/ Investigational).
32305589,There is a need to reassess the in vitro data and to carry out randomised clinical trials.
32305883,Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients' clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32305884,Studies are rapidly published to share information regarding epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic patterns, and prognosis.
32305937,Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis.

32306118,Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially.
32306118,Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19.
32306118,Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
32306166,With the cooperation of the whole hospital and radiology department, a number of effective evaluation methods have been carried out to ensure the optimization of clinical protection.
32306166,To our knowledge, the establishment of standardized protection and clear process has opened up a new idea of epidemic prevention management, which can effectively provide timely, efficient, and accurate support for clinical research, and promote the transformation from clinical research type to scientific research management type.
32306288,Since in vitro studies and a preliminary clinical report suggested the efficacy of chloroquine for COVID-19-associated pneumonia, there is increasing interest in this old antimalarial drug.
32306288,Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose.
32306452,We reasonably speculate several potential directions of clinical management including host-directed therapies aiming to restore dysregulated RAS caused by ACE2 deficiency.
32306491,Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice.
32306491,While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.
32306492,Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes is urgent needed to improve management of Covid-19 patients.
32306500,Pre-clinical responses to fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks heavily depend on choosing the best isolates for animal models that inform diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.
32306513,The patient had been already treated with topical and traditional therapies, without any clinical benefits.
32306656,In view of the above questions, this article now puts forwards the corresponding suggestions and considerations from the perspective of clinical infectious diseases physician.
32306657,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical features and outcome of treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia. <b>Methods:</b> Literature on novel coronavirus pneumonia was retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE databases.
32306657,The meta-analysis result showed that the most common clinical symptoms of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were fever (91.6%) and cough (64.5%), followed by dyspnea (32.8%) and sputum (28.1%).
32306657,Headache (10.5%), sore throat (11.2%), hemoptysis (3.2%), diarrhea (6.6%) and the other symptoms were relatively rare.
32306657,Heterogeneity between studies was significant; however, subgroup and sensitivity analysis had failed to identify clear sources of heterogeneity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low. <b>目的：</b> 自2019年12月首次报道新型冠状病毒肺炎以来，该传染病已迅速发生于全国各地及海外多个国家。
32306755,To explore the clinical and dynamic computed tomography features of coronavirus disease 2019.
32306755,Symptoms were fever, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle pain.
32306755,Coronavirus disease 2019 has certain clinical characteristics and typical computed tomography features.
32306822,Potential compounds were screened from the CHEMBL database, ZINC database, FDA approved drugs and molecules under clinical trials.
32306836,Thousands of compounds including approved drugs and drugs in the clinical trial are available in the literature.
32306853,Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.
32306864,Here, we conducted a serial investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centres from Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical symptoms.
32306864,Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design.
32307014,The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.
32307115,The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority.
32307151,This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS.
32307151,The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
32307189,Twenty cases who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 and had none of the known symptoms for this viral infection formed the test group.
32307189,Patients who had definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as those who had a history of hearing loss or a history of any known cause of hearing loss were excluded from the examined sample.
32307192,Medicare has recently allowed &quot;broad flexibilities to furnish services using remote communications technology to avoid exposure risks to health care providers, patients, and the community.&quot; [1] The implementation of telemedicine, or virtual, services, will help the Otolaryngologists provide needed care to patients while mitigating the clinical and financial impact of the pandemic.
32307245,Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies.
32307245,A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going.
32307245,Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro.
32307265,Nevertheless, patients without clinical or radiological (CT scan) markers of COVID-19, and with negative nasopharyngeal sample within 24h of surgery, are at low risk of being infected.
32307298,HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction.
32307313,The models used to compensate the total dose in case of temporary treatment interruption are well known but it is of importance in that pandemic context to update and homogenize clinical practice in order to improve local control without increasing normal tissue complications.
32307322,The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown.
32307322,A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis.
32307322,Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon.
32307519,The patient developed symptoms on 3rd March while staying in Miami where he arrived on 12th February.
32307550,Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels, T cell proportion and related gene expression occurring in COVID-19 patients on admission and after intial treatment. 11 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimen were enrolled in the hospital.
32307550,Cough and fever were the top symptoms in the 11 COVID-2019 cases.
32307593,Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originated from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, at the end of 2019, it has become a clinical threat to the general population worldwide.
32307653,Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation.
32308263,Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes.
32308494,Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients.
32308494,We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province.
32308532,We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila.
32308532,Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25.
32308532,Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged.
32308532,Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. <i>Influenza B</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs.
32308532,This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues.
32308532,Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease.
32308732,Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC).
32308732,Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed.
32308732,A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described.
32308732,TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP.
32309266,The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms.
32309266,Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome.
32309266,We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission.
32309266,The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide.Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies.Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.
32309267,We describe two elderly patients evaluated at emergency departments for anosmia/dysgeusia in the absence of any other respiratory symptoms prior to or upon admission.
32309267,In the current epidemiological context, clinical and biological work-up led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
32309267,In the current epidemiological situation, anosmia and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory conditions should be carefully evaluated.Special attention should be given to patients with non-classic COVID-19 symptoms in order to reduce transmission and protect health providers.
32309388,(III) We followed up 68 patients in isolation at home until symptoms disappeared.
32309679,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32309679,Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32309809,In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19.
32309809,Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found.
32309809,In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32309809,In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.
32309810,In this study, we reported 8 incidentally detected cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in chest computed tomography (CT) scan of patients referred to emergency department following multiple trauma without any respiratory symptoms.
32309812,SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a pneumonia that was identified through fever, dyspnea, and acute respiratory symptoms and named COVID-19.
32310621,In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
32310621,Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death.
32310621,SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates.
32310621,Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.
32310621,Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults.
32310621,The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
32310621,In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
32310815,Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses.
32310815,Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making.
32310915,However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis.
32310915,In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence.
32310915,Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited.
32310916,Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration.
32310916,In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels.
32310920,The integrated clinical, laboratory and ultrasound approach is essential for the diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of the patient's therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32310921,Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.
32310921,A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.
32311109,To analyse the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which may provide evidence to establish discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients.
32311109,The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.
32311109,The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 - 44 days with an average of 25 ± 6 days.
32311151,Under the outbreak of COVID-19, it was urgent to analyze the cases from clinical features and epidemiological factors, as well as understand the effectiveness of measures taken on disease prevent and control.
32311151,A retrospective study was applied for descriptive analysis of clinical features and epidemiological factors of confirmed cases in four cities of Zhejiang.
32311151,Clinical features of fever and cough were found mostly happen on patients.
32311318,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have tried every effort to understand the disease, and a brief portrait of its clinical features have been identified.
32311318,In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension.
32311318,Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients.
32311350,This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the clinical outcomes reported for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
32311350,Coronavirus disease 2019 associated with respiratory insufficiency in late pregnancies certainly creates a complex clinical scenario.
32311437,However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples.
32311437,COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's ⟪pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) ⟫, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1].
32311437,Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.
32311451,The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death.
32311451,Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism.
32311451,We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms.
32311451,Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms.
32311451,High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility.
32311451,Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients.
32311451,It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients' stool samples.
32311512,We compared clinical, laboratory, radiological, and outcome features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) with pneumonia, with vs without diarrhea.
32311643,In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion.
32311650,We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
32311650,Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea.
32311650,As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.
32311650,Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.
32311668,Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes.
32311771,We propose that transmission is associated with time in proximity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, rather than the procedures per se.
32311790,A total of 138 medical records of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study.
32311790,Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis.
32311816,This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on (a) varied clinical presentations; (b) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; (c) the roles of the emergency department, emergency medical system, and the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL); and (4) regional STEMI systems of care.
32311826,Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms.
32311826,In addition to its central role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, the clinical laboratory provides critical information to clinicians regarding prognosis, disease course, and response to therapy.
32311836,Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by e-mail on March 25, 2020, about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, health care changes, and related experiences during the prior 2 weeks.
32311836,Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms.
32311843,One of the most important clinical features of the infection is a profound coagulopathy.
32312018,The distribution and morphology of lesions on chest CT, clinical data will be recorded.
32312025,While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications.
32312025,Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.
32312064,As two important means of examination, computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have always been controversial in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32312064,Here, we report a family cluster case of a father and a son diagnosed as COVID-19 at our hospital, and described the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, CT changes, diagnosis and treatment strategy of these two patients.
32312064,For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions.
32312064,Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.
32312158,The decrease in clinical opportunities due to the limitations on elective surgical cases and office visits as well as potential resident redeployment could lead to a decline in overall experience as well as key indicator cases.
32312163,Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers.
32312362,The Subspecialty Group of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association and the Subspecialty Group of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Doctor Association have developed the recommendations on the identification and transfer of children with critical diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak, which provide a reference for primary doctors to quickly assess the severity of patient's condition and treat the illness accordingly, thus reducing the risk of referral infection and improving clinical prognosis.
32312363,To study the clinical features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32312363,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 115 children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Wuhan Children's Hospital, including general information, history of close contact with individuals of SARS-CoV-2 infection, early clinical symptoms, laboratory examination results, and lung CT results.
32312363,As for clinical symptoms, 29 children (25.2%) had fever, 47 (40.9%) had respiratory symptoms (including cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and 61 (53.0%) were asymptomatic.
32312364,To study the clinical features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32312364,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital.
32312364,Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting.
32312364,As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type.
32312364,Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed.
32312365,In addition to the typical respiratory symptoms, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also has the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular system damage.
32312544,We provide treatment advice as a pragmatic perspective on the risk/benefit ratio in specific clinical scenarios.
32312567,They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.
32312571,Clinical information on airway management and expert recommendations in these patients are urgently needed.
32312571,Based on clinical information and expert recommendation, we propose detailed planning, strategy, and methods for tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients.
32312574,The overlap in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment.
32312574,Additionally, the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography (EKG) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with COVID-19 infections.
32312600,This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS.
32312600,The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
32312628,Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms.
32312628,In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time.
32312676,A nation-wide workgroup drew guidelines based on clinical experience, national and local recommendations and scientific literature.
32312892,Clinical trials and other research activities are inevitably impacted.
32312892,Regulatory bodies have issued guidance on managing clinical trials during the pandemic, including contingency measures for remote study visits, delivery of investigational product, and site monitoring visits.
32312892,New cancer clinical trial practices during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic include new risk assessment strategies, decentralized and remote trial coordination, data collection, and delegation of specific therapeutic activities.
32312892,This experience could provide evidence of more feasible and cost-effective methods for future clinical trial conduct.
32313360,In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided.
32313463,The most common presenting symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias and/or fatigue.
32313588,The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context.
32313785,Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms.
32313785,Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care.
32313804,In this review, we discuss the current implications of the changing genomic epidemiology of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its potential relationship with the change of clinical manifestations in patients with confirmed infection.
32313804,Simultaneously, also new clinical manifestations are observed, particularly more prominent gastrointestinal and neurological findings.
32313804,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is changing not only its epidemiology, but also its genomic diversity and clinical manifestations, both aspects coupled, needs to be considered in the study of this ongoing pandemic.
32313807,Clinicians should consider this entity since it may warrant appropriate isolation precautions especially in a patient who may not present primarily with typical constitutional and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19.
32313885,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32313885,Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32313886,Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization.
32313886,We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress.
32313886,When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected.
32314010,Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved.
32314249,Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery.
32314274,Changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of pregnant women during the pre-partum and post-partum periods require further elucidation.
32314274,Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of eight pregnant cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-partum and post-partum periods.
32314329,A similar effect of SARS-CoV-2 could partly explain risk factors and symptoms, and could potentially be treatable.
32314436,Having been infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), patients with COVID-19 mainly present with fever and respiratory symptoms (2).
32314460,We discuss the available data on cutaneous symptoms, although disease-specific symptoms have yet not been observed.
32314460,The consequences for systemic treatment are obvious but it will be most important to collect the clinical data for a better decision process.
32314483,Previous coronaviruses outbreaks reports, current published evidences on pathogenesis and on clinical reports of COVID infection in immunosuppressed patients are used to make a scientifically based decision.
32314685,He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and later a cough.
32314685,Subsequently, the patient's clinical status improved, and after 8 days of hospitalization, he was transferred out of the country, where he recovered.
32314790,Coronaviruses contribute to the burden of respiratory diseases in children, frequently manifesting in upper respiratory symptoms considered to be part of the &quot;common cold.&quot; Recent epidemics of novel coronaviruses recognized in the 21st century have highlighted issues of zoonotic origins of transmissible respiratory viruses and potential transmission, disease, and mortality related to these viruses.
32314799,Given the paucity of robust clinical trial data for most COVID-19 pharmacotherapies at this time, clinicians should continue to remain steadfast in recognition of interventions that improve clinical outcomes and vigilant in monitoring for acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in clinical trials with small sample sizes.
32314805,We systematically reviewed the computed tomography (CT) imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to provide reference for clinical practice.
32314808,I have read with great interest the article &quot;COVID-19 patients' clinical characteristics, discharge rate, and fatality rate of meta-analysis&quot; by Li and colleagues<sup>1</sup> .
32314808,The authors have conducted a comprehensive search for articles concerning the clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with COVID-19.
32314810,Our observations of virus in neural tissue, in conjunction with clinical correlates of worsening neurologic symptoms, pave the way to a closer understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2.
32315076,The COVID-19 pandemic has massively disrupted essential clinical research.
32315076,The objective was to study older participants' and their caregivers' perspectives to participate in ongoing clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32315076,VISN-16/Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), Department of Veterans Affairs.
32315076,Older participants and their caregivers (N = 51) enrolled in ongoing clinical research studies.
32315079,We hereby present a case of COVID-19-associated varicella-like exanthem in an 8-year-old girl with mild systemic symptoms.
32315122,In this report, we present a dual-organ (heart/kidney) transplant recipient who was found to have COVID-19 and, despite the presence of a number of risk factors for poor outcomes, had a relatively mild clinical course.
32315171,Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials.
32315386,Common symptoms of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever and cough.
32315386,We describe a 94-year-old man with well-controlled schizoaffective disorder, who presented with non-specific and atypical symptoms: delirium, low-grade pyrexia and abdominal pain.
32315386,This has implications for the screening, assessment and isolation of frail older people to COVID-specific clinical facilities and highlights the potential for spread among healthcare professionals and other patients.
32315487,In this study we report on the clinical and autoimmune characteristics of severe and critical novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32315487,The clinical, autoimmune, and laboratory characteristics of 21 patients who had laboratory-confirmed severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the intensive care unit of the Huangshi Central Hospital, Hubei Province, China, were investigated.
32315487,Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms, and most patients (76.2%) had at least one coexisting disorder on admission.
32315487,We also retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data from 21 severe and critical cases of COVID-19.
32315614,We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice.
32315723,Based on the published data, this review systematically discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and current intervention measures related to COVID-19 in the hope that it may provide a reference for future studies and aid in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.
32315725,We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice.
32315725,Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported.
32315756,Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that the fatality rate due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units.
32315817,Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32315817,The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3-27.5 %).
32315980,However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.
32315980,Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.
32315980,Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred.
32316270,Besides the ethical concern related to accelerated large-scale clinical trials of drugs with unproven efficacy, the known potential detrimental cardiac effects of these drugs should also be considered.
32316618,Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
32316618,The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32316712,Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms.
32316713,With comprehensive analysis of relevant literature, this paper reviews the clinical characteristics of neoplastic patients with COVID-19, and puts forward some suggestions on how to deal with this epidemic.
32316718,Four of them are &quot;calls for action&quot;, 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients.
32317038,Each subscriber receives free daily supportive text messages, for 3 months, crafted by a team of clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health therapist, and mental health service users.
32317050,However, they lack diversity and are almost non-existent in some study fields, such as clinical research.
32317050,The findings suggest that evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies will be improved when more results from clinical research becomes available.
32317180,To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.
32317180,The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis.
32317180,The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population.
32317180,Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding.
32317205,Our experience highlights the importance of the use of a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach that tailors to the specific condition of the patient in achieving a favorable clinical outcome.
32317225,While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care.
32317267,Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load.
32317402,Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes.
32317402,We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes.
32317434,Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement.
32317557,The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare.
32317557,Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.
32317808,The clinical knowledge about the course, complications and treatment of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is so far limited.
32317808,This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China.
32317808,Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT).
32317810,Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.
32318325,The objectives of this study were to analyze the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment.
32318325,A retrospective analysis of the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination of 19 patients with COVID-19 from the Liyuan Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between January 16, 2020 and February 20, 2020 was undertaken.
32318325,The clinical laboratory indices change significantly, especially the D-dimer level among non-survivors.
32318327,Effective antivirals with safe clinical profile are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis.
32318327,In a proof-of-concept trial involving 31 patients with COVID-19, DIP supplementation was associated with significantly decreased concentrations of D-dimers (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), increased lymphocyte and platelet recovery in the circulation, and markedly improved clinical outcomes in comparison to the control patients.
32318327,In particular, all 8 of the DIP-treated severely ill patients showed remarkable improvement: 7 patients (87.5%) achieved clinical cure and were discharged from the hospitals while the remaining 1 patient (12.5%) was in clinical remission.
32318665,Three 3-5 years old and two 15 years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS-CoV-2, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X-ray, histopathological changes and immune response.
32318703,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing were obtained.

32319118,The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has recently affected Italy since February 21, constitutes a threat to normal subjects, as the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even death.
32319118,When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting.
32319129,At the current stage of knowledge, children have less severe symptoms of COVID-19, and severe asthma and immunodeficiency are classified as risk factors.
32319131,At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32319131,Apart from massive testing of personnel in pre-defined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them.
32319218,In this report, we present a 77-year old patient with a heart transplant under relevant immunosuppressive therapy who was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after several days of dyspnoea, dry cough and light general symptoms.
32319218,The patient received an antiviral therapy with hydroxychloroquine showing no further deterioration of the clinical state.
32319433,Above all, this pandemic force us to review what is essential and really necessary in term of priorities and regulatory process for clinical pharmacological research.
32319433,However, several clinical centres decided to use off label drugs as a standard of care in the absence of efficacy and safety data.
32319433,The lessons we will learn from this emergency may result crucial in redesigning a better way of conducting clinical trials and information on drugs.
32319435,We still do not have clear what positive criteria can help make clinical decisions in contexts of insufficient resources that force us to make choices.
32319443,On 6 March 2020, the Italian Society of Anaesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive care (SIAARTI) published the document &quot;Clinical Ethics Recommendations for Admission to and Suspension of Intensive Care in Exceptional Conditions of Imbalance between Needs and Available Resources&quot;.
32319444,They have to apply specific clinical and ethical criteria, in emergency conditions.
32319444,The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status.
32319444,The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life.
32319446,The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.

32320004,The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.
32320059,The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough cautiousness.
32320066,SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
32320082,Clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and risk factors associated with poor outcomes have been reported in various studies.<sup>1-2</sup> Nevertheless, information on whether other respiratory pathogens (RP) were co-detected in patients in these series was not provided, despite the fact that coinfections with RP have been reported to occur in this clinical setting.<sup>3-6</sup> This article is protected by copyright.

32322146,We have expanded on non-US public health recommendations to provide guidance to frontline HCWs to enhance collaboration between clinicians, who are often siloed in their clinical practices, and ultimately to protect the federal workforce, which cannot sustain a significant loss of frontline HCWs.
32322398,The limited clinical data about the virus's behavior to date, especially extrapulmonary symptoms, suggest that we should be aware of the possibility of initial cerebrovascular manifestations of COVID-19.
32322400,Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms.
32322400,After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue.

32327758,The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and user-friendly fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org.
32327904,The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms.
32327904,Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients.
32328367,This review will introduce a general overview of coronavirus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32328367,Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counseling of patients worldwide.

32328757,Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need.
32328954,Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS.
32328954,The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.
32329026,Although this should be interpreted cautiously, it may be possible that either the viral clearance kinetics in these matrices matches the progressive clinical recovery of the patient or that the virus was never present in these fluids at the time of the laboratory diagnosis.
32329044,Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system.
32329044,Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

32329246,In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial.
32329275,All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention &amp; control, and others.
32329419,The clinical trials are underway for Remdesivir, an investigational anti-viral drug from Gilead Sciences.
32329520,Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are reported.
32329520,Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit.
32329520,Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds.
32329520,Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway.
32329520,Their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.
32329659,In order to better control the rapid spread of coronavirus and manage the COVID-19 crisis, both developed and developing countries can improve the efficiency of their health system by replacing a proportion of face-to-face clinical encounters with telehealth.
32329756,Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count.
32329877,In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite.

32329915,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects principally the respiratory tract but recent studies described that COVID-19 could present a broader clinical spectrum from the absence of any symptoms to heart <sup>1</sup> , digestive <sup>2</sup> or Ear-Nose-Throat (including anosmia and ageusia) <sup>3</sup> manifestations.
32329920,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the reorganization of health-care settings affecting clinical care delivery to patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) as well as other inherited muscular dystrophies.
32329920,We address issues surrounding corticosteroid and exon-skipping treatments, cardiac medications, hydroxychloroquine use, emergency/respiratory care, rehabilitation management, and the conduct of clinical trials.
32329921,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reorganization of healthcare settings affecting the delivery of clinical care to patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
32329921,There is a concern that patients with SMA may be at increased risk of manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19.
32329922,Articles reporting clinical practice guidelines for tracheostomy in the context of COVID-19 were included.
32329923,Factors contributing to reduced clinical volume included lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) (35%) and lack of rapid COVID-19 testing (86%).
32329926,This study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways.
32329926,Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID-19 were derived by consensus and available evidence.
32329971,Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded.
32329971,Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic.
32329971,Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).
32329978,The aim of the study was to identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with severe incidence of SARS ‑CoV‑2 infection.
32330073,Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent.
32330078,Oral symptoms are prominent before fever and cough occur.
32330209,The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose.
32330277,This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
32330277,Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results.

32330287,A descriptive summary organized by aspects of clinical presentations (symptoms, imaging, and laboratory) and outcomes (maternal and perinatal).
32330287,COVID-19 infection during pregnancy probably has a clinical presentation and severity resembling that in non-pregnant adults.
32330288,Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions.
32330293,As an emerging infectious disease, the clinical course and virological course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be further investigated.
32330293,In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with clinical course more than two months.
32330293,In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course.
32330297,It is best implemented in subgroups with low clinical suspicion.
32330303,Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed.
32330305,The purpose of this study was to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) in urine and blood specimens, and anal and oropharyngeal swabs from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and correlated positive results with clinical findings.
32330305,Patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded.
32330305,The presence of viral RNA was not necessarily predictive of clinical symptoms, for example, the presence of viral RNA in the urine did not necessarily predict urinary tract symptoms.
32330313,This study is to investigate the clinical characteristics of late pregnancy with asymptomatic 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection, evaluate the outcome of maternal and fetal prognosis, and identify the evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission.
32330313,Clinical data including laboratory test results and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning were collected and reviewed.
32330313,We reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 pregnant woman with detailed clinical information and our result indicated that for late pregnant women with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, there might be no intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.
32330317,Given the cancellation of all elective procedures with the COVID-19 crisis, many anesthesiology learners are assigned to stay at home, limiting opportunities to learn in the clinical environment.
32330343,Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU admission, intubation or death).
32330343,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%).
32330356,With the rapidly expanding pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, there is concern that solid organ transplant recipients will be particularly vulnerable to infection and may experience a more severe clinical course.
32330356,We describe each patient's medical history including transplantation history, their clinical presentation and workup, and their course from diagnosis to either hospital discharge or to improvement in symptoms.
32330356,These reports demonstrate a range of symptoms, clinical severity, and disease course in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19, including two hospitalized patients and two patients managed entirely in the outpatient setting.
32330458,When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance.

32335200,Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p &lt; 0.05).
32335200,In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p &lt; 0.05).
32335200,Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce.
32335200,The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.
32335334,Considering the current pandemic of COVID-19, it is imperative to gauge the role of molecular divergence in SARS-CoV-2 with time, due to clinical and epidemiological concerns.

32335900,The current international COVID-19 health crisis underlines the importance of adequate and suitable personal protective equipment for clinical staff during acute airway management.
32336042,We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in a group of patients with COVID-19.
32336042,Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects.
32336042,Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset.
32336042,Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID-19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms.
32336069,The most common symptoms of COVID‑19 are: fever (81.8%-100%), cough (46.3%-86.2%), myalgia and fatigue (11%-50%), expectoration (4.4%-72%), and dyspnea (18.6%-59%).
32336069,One of the life‑threatening cardiac manifestations is coronavirus fulminant myocarditis, which may also occur without accompanying symptoms of pulmonary involvement.
32336069,Thus, it is important to know typical COVID‑19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.

32336563,This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS.
32336563,The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
32336572,In this paper, we have presented an adult otitis media case whom infected with COVID-19, but she have not any classical COVID-19 symptoms.
32336586,PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords &quot;COVID 19,&quot; &quot;SARS-CoV-2,&quot; and &quot;treatment.&quot; All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines.
32336586,There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development.
32336594,Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care.
32336612,Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.
32336723,Currently, no treatment for SARS-CoV-2 are approved because of lack of evidence, but a number of clinical trials are in process and we are expecting fruitful results very soon.
32336723,This review focuses on various approaches of treatment and few of the most recent clinical trials carried out in this field.
32336959,Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs.
32336959,The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury.
32337113,In this study, we will provide a brief review of viral origin, identification, symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain.
32337131,However, the unpreparedness of the nations, even with the advanced medical sciences and resources, has failed to address the mental health aspect amongst the public, as all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32337143,The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.
32337143,The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
32337148,Patients with Covid-19 disease commonly present with symptoms related to respiratory illness, and less commonly they develop cardiovascular complications either on presentation or during the course of the disease.
32337151,Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring.
32337201,The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties.
32337201,A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus.
32337201,Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
32337201,Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19.
32337584,In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms.
32337584,Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results.
32337584,Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007).
32337591,Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records.
32337664,Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials.
32337664,In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)&quot; in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.
32337769,Therefore, any treatment which can decrease the severe symptoms due to lung damage may help attenuate mortality rates.
32337790,The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
32337859,Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress.
32337859,He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms.
32337859,The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms.
32337859,These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course.
32338155,Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32338155,Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse opinions on this urgent topic.
32338224,In this connection, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to induce T cell apoptosis, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [24, 25].
32338224,Despite lymphopenia, evidence for an exaggerate release of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6] has been reported in the course acute respiratory syndrome in COVID19 infected patients, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [34].
32338224,Then, Gurwitz suggests to evaluate severity of symptoms in COVID-19 infected patients under previous chronic treatment with AT1R blockers in comparison to COVID-19 infected patients who did not take AT1R blockers [40].
32338224,Conversely, increase in ACE2 expression may facilitate the access into the host of COVID-19, thus, aggravating the clinical picture.
32338224,Such a dilemma would be solved by clinical trials based on RAS blockade or initiation and monitoring related effects.
32338254,The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 range from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia.
32338254,In a study of 7,736 Covid-19 patients in China, of all the clinical symptoms, hyposmia was not reported in any patient(2).
32338347,Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms.

32338400,Articles included describe original research or systematic reviews on obstacles to health services use and strategies to improve access to care; technological tools to provide or enhance interventions; patients' and clinicians' attitudes or perspectives on using digital tools for clinical care; factors influencing therapeutic alliance; and ideas for improving reach and uptake of digital interventions.
32338566,A literature review revealed few reports providing front-line clinical and research teams guidance related to multilevel, rapidly evolving COVID-19 directives.<i>Method</i>: The Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) method was used to develop a clinical case series and conduct participant observation during an ongoing comparative effectiveness trial of peer-integrated, patient-centered interventions after traumatic injury.
32338566,Participants were patients enrolled in the intervention arm of the ongoing trial, as well as front-line clinicians, patient peer interventionists, and clinical research team members implementing the trial.
32338566,A daily clinical research team huddle that flexibly accommodated virtual participation was also feasibly implemented.<i>Conclusions</i>: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies can be feasibly integrated into ongoing clinical interventions during the pandemic.
32338566,Routine, proactive clinical and research team communication that transparently addresses ethical tensions and health-sustaining activities may promote well-being for providers grappling with rapidly evolving pandemic directives.
32338605,Common symptoms include a fever and persistent cough and COVID-19 patients also often experience an excess of fluid in the lungs, which makes it difficult to breathe.
32338613,The top five searches related to health were &quot;face masks,&quot; &quot;amuchina&quot; (disinfectant), &quot;symptoms of the novel coronavirus,&quot; &quot;health bulletin,&quot; and &quot;vaccines for coronavirus.&quot; The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total &gt;140).
32338613,The majority of searches were related to amuchina, face masks, health bulletins, and COVID-19 symptoms.
32338767,To slow the spread of COVID-19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.
32339074,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) strain has caused a pandemic that affects everyday clinical practice.
32339082,The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19.
32339082,The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 +/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR).
32339082,The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32339082,The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis.
32339082,Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.
32339091,Meanwhile, nationwide surveillance data revealed drastic decreases in influenza diagnoses in outpatient departments, positivity rates of clinical specimens, and confirmed severe cases during the first 12 weeks of 2020 compared with the same period of 2019.
32339235,Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic.
32339248,This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
32339248,Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results.
32339250,Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed.
32339344,Usual clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection include fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, dry cough, dyspnea that may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (1).
32339344,Skin symptoms of COVID-19 have been poorly described but may include erythematous rash, urticaria and chicken pox like lesions (2-7).
32339382,Data were collected from the clinical records using a standardised questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co-morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding.
32339391,To reduce the severity and mortality with COVID-19, we propose to probe for the clinical response to thiazolidinediones (TZDs), PPARγ agonists, that are the well-known anti-diabetic drugs.
32339394,With the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been suddenly confronted with the difficulty of treatment provision and continuation of clinical trials without face-to-face contact.
32339394,In this piece, we will describe electronic scales (e-scales) and provide guidance on how clinicians/researchers might best implement e-scales in their clinical practice or research studies to remotely measure weight.
32339508,None of health care providers have developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.
32339895,Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW.
32339960,This study focused on older patients with COVID-19 infection and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them.
32339960,The information including demographic, epidemiological, clinical, classification of severity and outcomes.
32339960,56.7 % of elderly confirmed patients were male, fever (78.3 %), cough (56.7 %), dyspnea (30.0 %), and fatigue (23.3 %) were common symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
32339971,This protocol is a collaborative effort based on knowledge gleaned from clinical and simulation experience from Children's Hospital Colorado, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and Boston Children's Hospital.
32339998,From the adoption of electronic medical records to mobile health apps and other disruptive technologies, digital health solutions have promised a better quality of care at a more sustainable cost.
32340018,The patient's symptoms and lung imaging changes were atypical.
32340047,Across 13 identified studies, quarantine measures were consistently associated with negative psychosocial outcomes, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, stress, posttraumatic stress, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization.
32340048,An extensive strain was reported due to stress experience as well as depression and anxiety symptoms.
32340048,Severe degrees of those symptoms were found in 2.2 % to 14.5 % of all participants.
32340048,The severity of mental symptoms was influenced by age, gender, occupation, specialization, type of activities performed and proximity to COVID-19 patients.
32340048,Considering the frequency of mental symptoms occurring in healthcare workers, accompanying mental health informed interventions to facilitate coping are necessary.
32340051,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered increasing symptoms of an undiagnosed delusional disorder at a mid-60-year-old woman resulting in an attempted suicide.
32340051,Because of a pandemic with noticeable and visible social changes, it seems likely that people with previously subclinical psychotic illnesses are more often admitted to psychiatric care for the first time.
32340089,Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms.
32340092,Based on systematic review of the role of clinical treatment, disease control and scientific research, and combining with the problems exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic, suggestions were proposed to reform and improve the prevention and treatment system for major epidemics diseases in China.
32340092,In clinical treatment, it is necessary to enhance clinical staff's awareness of law-based reporting, capabilities of syndromic surveillance, the use of infectious diseases reporting systems, and to improve national or local monitoring platforms for emerging infectious diseases detection.
32340095,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical courses and outcomes of COVID-19 cases and the influencing factors in Guangdong province and provide basis for the formulation or adjustment of medical care and epidemic control strategy for COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We collected demographic data, medical histories, clinical courses and outcomes of 1 350 COVID-19 patients reported in Guangdong as of 4 March 2020 via epidemiological investigation and process tracking.
32340095,Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. <b>Results:</b> Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal.
32340095,The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (a<i>HR</i>=1.87, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.43-2.46), older age (a<i>HR</i>=1.67, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (a<i>HR</i>=1.73, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (a<i>HR</i>=1.75, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (a<i>HR</i>=1.49, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.06-2.09). <b>Conclusions:</b> The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes.
32340096,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the feasibility of direct renin inhibitor aliskiren for the treatment of severe patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective case analysis of effectiveness and safety of aliskiren treatment to lower blood pressure in three severe and one critically ill patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. <b>Results:</b> Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory symptoms.
32340096,The condition improved, and all patients had reached the discharge standard and were discharged. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension.
32340096,Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is required with more COVID-19 patients.. <b>目的：</b> 探索直接肾素抑制剂阿利吉伦用于重型新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID-19)合并高血压患者治疗的可行性。
32340097,We compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and COVID-19 and found that COVID-19 was more contagious, more concealed in transmission, with greater infectious intensity and more severe clinical manifestations.
32340216,A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system.
32340539,The pandemic has resulted in significant changes in clinical practice for otolaryngologists in the United States; many changes have been implemented to mitigate risks identified by otolaryngologists in other countries.
32340539,As a result of COVID-19 recommendations, multiple institutions have overhauled resident clinical rotations and resident education.
32340588,Clinical data were derived from peer-reviewed primary literature and published guidelines from national or international medical organizations.
32340614,Second, when necessary, CMR on patients with confirmed or suspected active COVID-19 should focus on the specific clinical question with an emphasis on myocardial function and tissue characterization while optimizing patient and staff safety.
32340654,Issues include pharmacy practice, clinical therapeutics, and possible new treatments for the virus.
32340737,In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms.
32341078,With the surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide, the medical community should be aware of atypical clinical presentations to help with correct diagnosis, to take the proper measures to place the patient in isolation and to avoid healthcare professionals being infected by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
32341078,To report that patients who subsequently test positive for COVID-19 may present with acute abdominal pain and no pulmonary symptoms, although they already have typical lung lesions on computed tomography (CT) scan.
32341103,While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favor a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV-axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited.
32341103,We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV-axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.
32341111,Patients with COVID-19 present a broad spectrum of clinical presentation.
32341111,Identifying these clinical phenotypes and applying a personalised approach would benefit the optimisation of therapies and improve outcomes.
32341142,This assay is the first rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay including SARS-CoV-2 detection, and is fully compatible with a non-PCR trained laboratory or point-of-care (POC) testing.This evaluation was performed using 69 primary clinical samples (66 NPS, 1 BAL and 1 tracheal aspirate and 1 bronchial aspirate) comparing the SARS-CoV-2 detection with the currently WHO recommended RT-PCR (WHO-PCR) workflow.
32341142,Additionally, a comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed between QIAstat-SARS and the WHO-PCR using a quantified clinical sample.
32341142,The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity at 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29).
32341143,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population.
32341143,Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically.
32341143,In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Modified CDC), the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular), GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 assay (GenMark) and the Hologic Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic).
32341143,This information is crucial for both laboratories and clinical teams, as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made.
32341311,With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shifting of clinical care to telemedicine visits has been hastened.
32341442,Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present.
32341519,Timely analysis of the laboratory characteristics associated with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) can assist with clinical diagnosis and prognosis.
32341519,This study is a collection of clinical data from 54 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Zhongfa Xincheng district of China at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 28, 2020 to February 11, 2020.
32341630,Symptoms usually include fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32341721,The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
32341722,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea.
32341722,However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients.
32341722,The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain.
32341722,Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection.
32341722,Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign.
32341722,No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.
32341722,Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.
32341913,Clinical symptoms of coronavirus infections can range from relatively mild (similar to the common cold) to severe (bronchitis, pneumonia, and renal involvement).
32341943,On 31 December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of Health and Healthcare (Hubei Province, China) reported that there were 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin with symptoms starting on the 8 December.
32341943,The Ministry of Health summoned the Specialties Societies to prepare a clinical protocol for the management of COVID-19.
32342049,He was treated conservatively, with complete clinical recovery and resolution of his EKG abnormalities.
32342112,We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
32342140,The aim of this manuscript is to review the available strategies in the international literature to efficiently and safely return to both normal orthopaedic surgical activities and to normal outpatient clinical activities in the aftermath of a large epidemic or pandemic.
32342140,After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase.
32342191,To illustrate the [18F]FDG-PET/CT findings in patients affected by cancer with clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients who showed pulmonary involvement unrelated to cancer metastases on March 13 and 16 2020.
32342191,At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms.
32342191,The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management.
32342252,In a preliminary clinical study, we observed that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was effective against SARS-CoV-2 by shortening the duration of viral load in Covid-19 patients.
32342479,The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Taizhou, China.
32342479,All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records.
32342479,Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%).
32342479,Treatments of COVID-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed.
32342566,Statistically significant differences in chemosensitive recovery were detected based on age and distance from the onset of clinical manifestations.
32342566,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions represent common clinical findings in COVID-19 patients.
32342566,Otolaryngologists and head-neck surgeons must by now keep this diagnostic option in mind when evaluating cases of ageusia and nonspecific anosmia that arose suddenly and are not associated with rhinitis symptoms.
32342609,Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support.
32342609,We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.
32342609,In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.
32342609,Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.
32342636,From the first reports, ageusia and anosmia appear to be frequent clinical features in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients.
32342676,COVID-19 patients may be asymptomatic or show various clinical manifestations, including acute symptoms such as fever, fatigue, sore throat; pneumonia presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome; and multiple organ failure.
32342676,As COVID-19 has such varied clinical manifestations and case fatality rates, no standard antiviral therapy regimen has been established other than supportive therapy.
32342676,In the present guideline, we aim to introduce potentially helpful antiviral and other drug therapies based on <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> research and clinical experiences from many countries.
32342677,Since clinical feature of COVID-19 has not been fully evaluated yet, empirical antibacterial agents are frequently combined for the treatment of COVID-19 in addition to antiviral agents, concerning co-existing bacterial pathogens.
32342849,We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms).
32342863,This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32342870,During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.
32342872,The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis.
32342872,It has wider applications for the optimal utilisation of facilities, to improve clinical outcome in low- and middle-income countries, where limited resources continue to be a challenge.
32342928,The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled.
32343122,While clinicians are focused on correcting respiratory homeostasis, echoing the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is also invading other end-organs, which may not exhibit overt clinical features.
32343122,In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus.
32343162,The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted dermatology clinical trial operations due to mandated governmental and institutional shut-downs and newly implemented restrictions.
32343342,We discuss the implications of the COVID-19 global pandemic with respect to: (1) increased risk of infection and poor outcomes among people with schizophrenia, (2) anticipated adverse mental health consequences for people with schizophrenia, (3) considerations for mental health service delivery in inpatient and outpatient settings, and (4) potential impact on clinical research in schizophrenia.
32343342,Recommendations emphasize rapid implementation of measures to both decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission and maintain continuity of clinical care and research to preserve safety of both people with schizophrenia and the public.
32343363,Its initial emergence in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) not only highlighted the vulnerability of its patients and residents, but also the limited clinical support that led to national headlines.
32343410,The clinical features and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis patients with COVID-19 is unclear and understudied.
32343415,Here, 26 cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms, and no case of severe symptoms was found among these patients.
32343454,These changes raise a lot of questions regarding patient triage and treatment decisions in clinical situations when it is unclear if the workup and management can be postponed.
32343593,The initial gastrointestinal symptoms that appear early during the course of Covid-19 support this hypothesis.
32343593,In this special review, we describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cell and enterocyte and its potential clinical implications.
32343658,This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search.
32343658,The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials.
32343658,At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov.
32343658,Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro.
32343745,Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and outcomes were compared and analyzed between males and females.
32343745,Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged.
32343745,We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis.
32343947,However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea.
32343948,Validation studies of serological antibody tests must be properly designed for clinical, epidemiological and Public Health objectives such as confirmation of suspected COVID-19 cases, certification of seroconversion after infection, and epidemiological surveillance.
32343968,Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
32343968,These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.
32344011,While the clinical status, in particular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the need for their admittance to ICUs, several laboratory parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity.
32344056,Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to selectively deplete these cells.
32344166,A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice.
32344166,Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.
32344166,We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects.
32344166,We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.
32344167,Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were comparable between the two groups.
32344167,The median time from onset of symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 turning negative was 18 days (interquartile range (IQR) 12-21) in the umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR 11-21) in the control group (p 0.42).
32344167,A randomized control clinical trial is needed to assess the efficacy of umifenovir.
32344177,In vivo it showed efficacy, especially when combined with azithromycin in a preliminary clinical trial.
32344226,The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems.
32344226,It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms.
32344276,Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms.
32344276,COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia.
32344276,Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms.
32344310,A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32344310,It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms.
32344310,In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.
32344314,Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials.
32344317,In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population.
32344320,To explore the clinical course and its dynamic features of immune status in COVID-19 patients and find predictors correlated with severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
32344320,The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
32344321,Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected.
32344370,The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other related problems and symptoms.
32344422,These recommendations for physicians who perform bronchoscopy will help to protect those patients (un)-affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic, minimize the risk of transmission, and maintain clinical care for all patients.
32344439,Additionally a retrospective observational cohort study with descriptive analysis of epidemiological and clinical data of COVID patients admitted until March 31st was performed.
32344439,In the upcoming pandemic, adequate COVID management and care could be secured by a collaborative approach with inclusion of administrative departments, clinical disciplines and theoretical institutes of the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32344441,As such, clinical protocols and practice on labor and delivery units must adapt to optimize the safety of patients and health care workers and to better conserve health care resources.
32344449,These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.
32344456,These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care.
32344688,The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined.
32344688,To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale.
32344688,For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area.
32345226,To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province in China have not been described.
32345226,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital.
32345343,This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.
32345443,In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).
32345446,Literatures on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and infection control measures of COVID-19 were reviewed, practical knowledge from first-line otolaryngologists in China, the United States, and Brazil were reviewed and collated.
32345446,It was recommended that otolaryngology professionals should improve screening in suspected patients with relevant nasal and pharyngeal symptoms and signs, suspend non-emergency consultations and examinations in clinics, and rearrange the working procedures in operating rooms.
32345579,This study explores the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes with severe covid-19, and the association of diabetes with survival duration in patients with severe covid-19.
32345579,In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 193 patients with severe covid-19 were collected. 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes.
32345702,However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of kidney-related complications, including hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI.
32345702,In this retrospective, single-center study in China, we analyzed data from electronic medical records of 333 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including information about clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and other characteristics, as well as information about renal outcomes.
32345702,Although proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI often resolved in such patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, renal complications in COVID-19 were associated with higher mortality.
32345728,Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined.
32345728,Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness.
32345861,These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the short-term, and place individuals at risk for persistent stress-exposure syndromes, sub-clinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the long-term.
32346093,Alongside investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and rational design of effective therapies.
32346373,The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms.
32346373,We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms.
32346373,Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8).
32346373,A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, <i>p</i> = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0-7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, <i>p</i> = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, <i>p</i> = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, <i>p</i> = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3-8.5).
32346373,Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32346490,To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID-19 although several clinical trials are underway to test possible therapies.
32346492,Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19.
32346593,The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough.
32346593,This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
32346594,All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.
32346594,The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days.
32346676,These community-led initiatives will fill key knowledge gaps to tackle crucial clinical questions on the complexities of infection with the causative coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 in the large, heterogeneous group of vulnerable patients with cancer.
32346785,Data was obtained regarding demographics and clinical and surgical practice during the pandemic.
32346873,We investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 without any symptoms.
32346873,The demographic characteristics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without any symptoms were analyzed.
32346873,Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.
32347067,Therefore, the optimized assay developed in this study can be used in screening and early clinical diagnosis.
32347067,Our work provides a tool to facilitate rapid clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32347200,Healthcare workers (n = 803) with mild symptoms were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 90 positive) and asked to complete a symptom questionnaire.
32347200,A predictive model based on these symptoms showed moderate discriminative value (sensitivity: 91.2%; specificity: 55.6%).
32347201,We describe clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 44 Caucasian patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at a single hospital in Pavia, Italy, from 21-28 February 2020, at the beginning of the outbreak in Europe.
32347453,The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients.
32347453,A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning.
32347618,Their age, sex, diagnosis of disease, requirement for emergent intervention, and their medical records about COVID-19 were obtained.
32347747,Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.
32347772,Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care.
32347772,Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347975,The European AIDS Clinical Society states the lack of evidence for a higher COVID-19 infection rate among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and there is a few published literature on the course of COVID-19 co-infection in PLHIV.
32347997,When thoughtfully applied in the appropriate clinical context, small practice adaptations like this can facilitate telehealth solutions that diminish unnecessary exposure for patients, their caregivers, and health care staff.
32348042,This review summarizes current knowledge on the incidence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.
32348047,Older patients do not always present with typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnoea) but sometimes are and remain asymptomatic (contact screening), or have aspecific presentations (altered general condition, falls, delirium, unusual fatigue).
32348049,In this article, we discuss the known or suspected interactions between the virus and the kidneys, as well as their clinical presentations.
32348051,These patients should therefore isolate themselves and remain alert to the occurrence of other symptoms suggestive of the infection and/or be tested.
32348052,Any possible clinical impact of these treatments on COVID-19 infection remains to be clarified; in the meantime, they should be continued.
32348053,At an individual level, they have to adapt their clinical practice and consider specific issues of teleconsultations to address patient's needs.
32348055,However recently acquired data and clinical experience suggest that COVID-19-related ARDS presents some specificities that will be summarized in the present article.
32348056,Alongside organizational challenges, clinical issues such as rapid respiratory distress, clinical suspicions with negative PCR and treatment uncertainties in the absence of sufficient evidence were overcome.
32348111,Therefore, it is important to screen the COVID-19 patients for neurological symptoms as well as possibility of the collapse of the respiratory center in the brainstem should be investigated in depth.
32348166,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups.
32348339,Our study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, the registration number: ChiCTR2000029829.
32348545,To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data.
32348545,Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns.
32348545,We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis.
32348545,Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms).
32348545,The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19.
32348545,Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings.
32348581,We describe a small-team &quot;cohorting&quot; protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures.
32348581,A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between department members but providing comprehensive coverage.
32348581,Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions.
32348582,Some are continuing routinely, especially those who are overseeing clinical trials that could offer life-saving therapies, particularly against the novel coronavirus.
32348588,The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals.
32348588,Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19.
32348588,We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments.
32348588,The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues.
32348588,Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.
32348591,This document provides clinical practice guidelines based on available evidence to date to balance the risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with the risks associated with dysphagia.
32348591,Despite significant limitations in clinical service provision during the pandemic of COVID-19, a safe and reasonable dysphagia care pathway can still be implemented with modifications of setup and application of newer technologies.
32348783,Early clinical evidence suggests that severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are frequently characterized by hyperinflammation, imbalance of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and a particular form of vasculopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy, and intravascular coagulopathy.
32348783,We discuss the underlying pathogenesis and the interaction between multiple systems, resulting in propagation of immunothrombosis, which through investigation in the coming weeks, may lead to both an improved understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and identification of innovative and efficient therapeutic targets to reverse the otherwise unfavorable clinical outcome of many of these patients.
32349014,Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles.
32349014,Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; supersedes usual teaching responsibilities.
32349033,These platforms can facilitate routine diagnostic assays in certified clinical labs.
32349035,Studies about the biological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in clinic animal and humans will manipulate an understanding the origin of pandemic crisis.
32349045,The pressure to the health services worldwide has been unprecedented.The redeployment of staff and resources to treat more efficiently COVID-19 cases along with the need to reduce disease transmission has affected the field of electrophysiology among many others.Amendments to clinical pathways are obligatory in this perspective to continue to provide the necessary health services to the people who need them while at the same time infection control and prevention are not compromised by inadvertent disease transmission or unnecessary use of resources.We aim to providea guide of the logistic aspects of electrophysiology procedures derived fromour Tertiary Cardiac Centre duringthe current COVID-19 pandemic.
32349053,However, once again, pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from participating in clinical trials during this pandemic.
32349053,This &quot;protection by exclusion&quot; of pregnant women from drug development and clinical therapeutic trials, even during epidemics and pandemics, is not unprecedented.
32349053,Therefore, we recommend and urge the scientific community and professional societies that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19 based on the concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent.
32349055,In this hypothesis paper, we suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may induce intravascular pulmonary thrombosis, which may result in the rapid worsening of clinical conditions and, eventually, exitus.
32349133,Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity.
32349183,Clinical questions were collated, and an evidence report was rapidly generated and disseminated.
32349517,The outbreak caused by COVID-19 is causing a major challenge to clinical management and a worldwide threat to public health.
32349517,Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like.
32349517,In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.
32349517,We would like to see these relevant studies, ranging from basic researches to clinical application, could provide some idea on effects of CHM to combat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses, and also offer new thinking for the exploration of therapeutic strategies under the guidance of TCM.
32349772,The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32349772,Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies.
32349772,This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.
32349982,Therefore, with World Scleroderma Foundation endorsement, experts from different specialties including rheumatology, virology and clinical immunology gathered virtually to answer to the main practical clinical questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection coming from both patients and physicians.
32350047,While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays.
32350048,We compared the analytical performance of a laboratory developed test (LDT) developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs.
32350134,The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed.
32350134,Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days.
32350134,Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32350161,We retrospectively analyzed 303 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and evaluated the clinical data of 240 patients who were discharged.
32350226,For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and the clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals.
32350226,The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&amp;W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens.
32350632,We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19.
32350686,Several existing antiviral drugs, previously developed or used as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, are being investigated as COVID-19 treatments and some of them are being used in clinical trials.
32350686,There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.
32350686,Therefore, for the better safety of patients with COVID-19, further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all the potential drugs.
32350794,(1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test.
32350796,The current global outbreak of COVID-19 represents a major challenge in terms of epidemiology, contagiousness, treatment, as well as clinical and radiological behavior of this disease.
32350796,Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms.
32350861,COVID-19 may also be such a defining moment for clinical pharmacology in terms of its role in drug development and therapy.
32350871,A retrospective analysis of medical records and comparison of vaginal delivery outcomes between 10 pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and 53 pregnant women without COVID-19 admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 20 and March 2, 2020.
32350871,Results of laboratory tests, imaging tests, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were also analyzed in neonates delivered by pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
32350871,Neonates delivered by pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32350928,As an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high-quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease.
32350928,Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease.
32350928,In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.
32351037,This study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with COVID-19 in Shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference.
32351037,299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms.
32351037,207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization.
32351037,These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia.
32351040,Most individuals required hospitalization and presenting symptoms were similar to those of nontransplant individuals.
32351103,In the early stages, thorax CT findings could be present even before the onset of symptoms, thorax CT has quite high sensitivity in COVID-19 patients with false negative RT-PCR results, and it has a great importance not only in diagnosis but also in follow up (6,7).
32351807,In a recently published, single-center case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, investigators reported that approximately 10% of patients initially presented with GI symptoms, prior to the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms.
32351807,Common and often very subtle symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, with a less common symptom being nonspecific GI illness.
32351851,Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started, and the patient responded favorably with improvement of symptoms.
32351860,We report a case of COVID-19 infection that presented with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia.
32352081,The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) resulting from a distinctive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve in many countries and pose life-threatening clinical issues to global public health.
32352081,Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown.
32352081,However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19.
32352202,The clinical presentation of European patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection is still unknown.
32352202,To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe.
32352202,Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire.
32352202,The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%).
32352202,The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5±5.7 days.
32352202,The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex.
32352202,The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients.
32352224,Hence, several possible clinical scenarios in the setting of liver diseases have been postulated.
32352224,First, patients with chronic liver disease may be more vulnerable to the severe clinical consequences of COVID-19, including oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia due to severe pneumonia or the cytokine storm <sup>1;2</sup> .
32352308,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this article is to review new pediatric lung disorders-including disorders that have occurred in recent years years such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine-origin influenza A (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI), and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia-to enhance understanding of the characteristic imaging findings. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Although the clinical symptoms of SARS, H1N1, MERS, EVALI, and COVID-19 pneumonia in pediatric patients may be nonspecific, some characteristic imaging findings have emerged or are currently emerging.
32352397,Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected.
32352397,A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy.
32352397,A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia.
32352397,The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately.
32352401,Although the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this illness have been reported in patients from China and Europe, data are scant in the United States.
32352401,Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs).
32352401,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (81%).
32352450,Since the outbreak of the pandemic, anecdotal observations have been accumulating rapidly that sudden anosmia and dysgeusia are peculiar symptoms associated with the COVID-19 infection.
32352450,Hopkins, as President of British Rhinological Society, published a letter describing &quot;the loss of sense of smell as a marker of COVID-19 infection&quot; and proposed that adults presenting with anosmia but no other symptoms should self-isolate for seven days.
32352450,Only 51% reported the recognized symptoms of cough or fever.
32352535,We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies.
32352576,The authors evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of five pregnant patients with COVID-19 at term, whose delivery was uneventful and led to favorable perinatal outcomes for both mother and neonate.
32352576,Centers should therefore be meticulous in their approach to a SARS-CoV-2+ pregnancy to optimize clinical outcomes for both mother and child.
32352913,With this report we aimed to share our concerns, clinical management, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and to present our current circuits and adjustments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in our maternity hospital.
32352957,In each city, the objective was to test all shelter residents and staff members at each assessed facility, irrespective of symptoms.
32353223,Demographic and daily clinical data were collected to identify predictors of early mortality.
32353347,Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.
32353347,Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1-5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1-2·7).
32353347,Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.
32353398,While elderly patients are at high risk of fatality, research concerning COVID-19 has largely been done on clarifying the clinical features.
32353398,Given that single-centre studies are less likely informative as elderly remains a minority in the total Chinese population, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources in the public domain.
32353441,Several studies have been published describing the clinical and radiographic findings on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia.
32353518,Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
32353518,IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event.
32353549,This study aimed to compare clinical courses and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19, and to assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy.
32353549,Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed.
32353549,Pregnant women have comparable clinical courses and outcomes with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women when infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32353740,Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe.
32353740,The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat.
32353740,More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient's condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems.
32353760,The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
32353857,Diagnostic testing is critical for epidemiological surveillance, but the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and clinical utility (impact on health outcomes) of the current diagnostic methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection are not known.
32353857,I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in.
32353859,There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32353859,Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds).
32353898,The clinical features of COVID-19 range from a mild illness to patients with a very severe illness with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ventilation and Intensive Care Unit admission.
32353898,Little is known about the mechanisms behind observed episodes of sudden deterioration or the infrequent idiosyncratic clinical demise in otherwise healthy and young subjects.
32353898,As in other diseases, the answer to some of these questions may in time be provided by genotyping as well careful clinical, serological, radiological and histopathological phenotyping, which enable mechanistic insights into the differences in pathogenesis and underlying immunological and tissue regenerative response patterns.
32353982,In the current work, we analyzed and elucidated the two main elements that should be taken into account to understand the &quot;ocular route&quot;, both from a clinical and molecular point of view.
32353991,We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector), and adjusted for disease importation.
32354081,Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus.
32354081,This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices.
32354181,High-impact articles covered fields of basic science and clinical medicine.

32354990,Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death).
32355099,Secondary to policies enacted by the New York State government to limit spread of the virus, Orthopedic Surgery departments at hospitals around the area have witnessed an abrupt change in clinical demands.
32355099,At a local level one trauma hospital in Queens, New York, Orthopedic Surgery elective cases have been cancelled, trauma consult volume has experienced a sharp decline, and both residents and attendings have been repurposed to meet the new clinical demands of this medical crisis.
32355099,We prepared this primer to make our experience with caring for COVID-19 patents available as a reference for other surgical subspecialty services preparing to adjust the clinical focus of their hospital teams during this or future pandemics.

32355546,Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity.
32355546,In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970].
32355546,Further investigations should be done to evaluate this assay in variety of clinical settings and populations.
32355564,Dornase alfa should be considered for clinical trials in treatment of severe COVID-19.
32355889,We aimed to survey gastroenterologists worldwide using Twitter to help elucidate these definitions using commonly encountered clinical scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods </b> A 16-question survey was designed by the authors to include common clinical scenarios that do not have clear guidelines regarding the timing or urgency of endoscopic evaluation.
32356025,These findings should be carefully interpreted in light of the clinical context of the patient and could prompt a pharyngeal swab PCR test to rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients.
32356569,The unprecedented challenges posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlight the urgency for applying clinical pharmacology and model-informed drug development in (i) dosage optimization for COVID-19 therapies, (ii) approaching therapeutic dilemmas in clinical trial settings, and (iii) maximizing value of information from impacted non-COVID-19 trials.
32356569,More than ever, we have a responsibility for adaptive evidence synthesis with a Totality of Evidence mindset in this race against time across biomedical research, clinical practice, drug development, and regulation.
32356583,This manuscript summarizes the common themes of the podcast which centered around three main topics: more benign clinical disease and progression in pediatric cases compared to adults, a strong need for strategies to protect health care workers, and social or economic disparities as a barrier to successful pandemic control.
32356626,Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.
32356626,Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.
32356627,Information about the use of selected drugs and patients' clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.
32356627,The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.
32356641,However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, and symptoms may be very mild or atypical.
32356641,There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID‑19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms.
32356641,These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
32356761,We hereby review the clinical insights with regard to using molecular tests and immunoassays in the context of COVID-19 management life cycle: the preventive phase, the preparedness phase, the response phase and the recovery phase.
32356761,Clinical needs are discussed to identify existing technology gaps in these tests.
32356863,This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020.
32356867,During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test.
32356867,Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care).
32356867,The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%).
32356900,This statement was planned on 11 March 2020 to provide clinical guidance and aid staff preparation for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia and New Zealand.
32356910,The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma.
32356910,Well-designed large multicenter clinical trial studies should be conducted urgently to establish the efficacy of CPT to COVID-19 patients.
32356926,In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).
32357072,We aimed to further clarify the clinical characteristics of diabetes with COVID-19. <i> <b>Methods:</b> </i> Twenty-eight patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were enrolled from January 29, 2020, to February 10, 2020, with a final follow-up on February 22, 2020.
32357072,Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. <i> <b>Results:</b> </i> The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 ± 9.0 years.
32357072,Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%).
32357074,Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death.
32357074,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from American Society for Artificial Internal Organs.
32357086,<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b><i>To analyze the application of Kirkpatrick's model in the nurse training program among the emergency surgery department based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019).
32357086,To provide reference for the training of emergency surgical nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19.</i><b> <i>Design:</i> </b><i>Guided by Kirkpatrick's model, 35 nurses in the emergency surgery department were trained according to a program that resulted from the clinical demand during the pandemic.
32357086,At learning level, the differences between theoretical and operational scores of tested nurses before and after training proved to be statistically significant (</i>p <i>&lt; 0.001).</i><b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b><i>The application of Kirkpatrick's model based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 confirms to be effective for the training program of nurses in the emergency surgery department.
32357086,It is also beneficial to improve nurses' knowledge and skills during the pandemic, which serves as a positive influence for clinical reference.</i>
32357257,This review discusses respirators, their purpose, types, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.
32357275,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of outpatients and inpatients in the department of kidney transplantation from January 20 to March 1, 2020, and followed up the in-home kidney transplant recipients and those waiting for kidney transplantation through the Internet platform.
32357503,Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines.
32357503,Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights.
32357503,Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32357575,The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.
32357575,There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
32358044,We also made necessary changes to clinical practices and enforced strict infection control measures.
32358202,However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ.
32358217,Telemedicine has rapidly moved to the frontline of clinical practice due to the need for prevention and mitigation strategies; these have been encouraged, facilitated, and enabled by changes in government rules and regulations and payer-driven reimbursement policies.
32358230,Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings.
32358232,Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death.
32358232,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO.
32358833,We assess the scope for targetting key host and viral targets in the mid-term, by first screening these targets against drugs already licensed; an agenda for drug re-purposing, which should allow rapid translation to clinical trials.
32358954,Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-COV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal co-infection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included.
32358956,Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. 112 patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhoea.
32358960,As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories.
32359035,Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14.
32359101,Through our hypothesis, we make the prediction that the FDA-approved molecule, icatibant, might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and, thereby, improve the clinical outcomes.
32359101,This hypothesis could lead to basic, translational, and clinical studies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
32359177,To reveal the hepatic injury related to this disease and its clinical significance, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Hubei Province.
32359203,In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry.
32359203,There are currently seven completed clinical trials and 29 registered clinical trials focusing on HCQ or CQ as a therapeutic avenue for COVID-19.
32359203,There are several clinical trials currently under way with results expected soon.
32359205,To report the clinical characteristics, including gastrointestinal symptoms, of COVID-19 in IBD patients, and to assess the risk of COVID-19 in IBD.
32359210,After initial flulike symptoms, progression to an inflammatory phase may occur, characterized by cytokine release rapidly leading to respiratory and multiorgan failure.
32359210,We report the clinical course and management of a liver transplant recipient on hemodialysis, who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, and despite completing a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, later developed marked inflammatory manifestations with rapid improvement after administration of off-label, single-dose tocilizumab.
32359479,With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective.
32359788,Specifically, it has been used in the treatment of many viral infections with varying degrees of clinical efficacy.
32359788,The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population.
32359937,The purpose of this study was to highlight the importance of timely brachytherapy treatment for patients with gynecologic, breast, and prostate malignancies, and provide a framework for brachytherapy clinical practice and management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32359943,We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China.
32359943,The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%).
32360053,A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever.
32360126,Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32360126,Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms.
32360133,It is unclear whether a more aggressive clinical course might develop in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected subjects during biological therapy and current evidence does not support treatment suspension.
32360133,When clinical conditions and the disease activity do not allow a treatment delay, before starting a biological therapy, screening of IBD patients for COVID-19 active infection by RT-PCR should be advisable, even in absence of clinical suspicion.
32360205,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea.
32360205,However, digestive symptoms have also been reported.
32360205,The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain.
32360205,Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection.
32360205,Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign.
32360205,No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.
32360205,Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.
32360286,Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data.
32360301,Herein, we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments, a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible.
32360420,Clinical intervention in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated a strong upregulation of cytokine production in patients who are critically ill with SARS-CoV2-induced pneumonia.
32360420,In a retrospective study of 41 patients with COVID-19, most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed mild symptoms, whereas some patients later developed aggravated disease symptoms, and eventually passed away because of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as a consequence of a severe cytokine storm.
32360439,Most patients with COVID-19 present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms, some patients present with atypical symptoms including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neurological symptoms.
32360439,We elucidate the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and the clinical course.
32360444,To narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and frontline opinions and to provide balanced answers to pressing clinical questions.
32360444,The available literature and the authors' frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, with a conclusive statement provided for each answer.
32360444,Physicians must be aware that, as they are not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled onto randomized clinical trials.
32360481,However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear.
32360481,In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases.
32360481,Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed.
32360481,Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases.
32360481,The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %).
32360481,The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days.
32360481,Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.
32360482,The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago.
32360482,In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections.
32360482,Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.
32360500,They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data.
32360500,These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children.
32360516,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating clinical manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia and is mainly based on an immune-driven pathology.
32360516,While a &quot;cytokine storm&quot; involving IL-6 and other cytokines has been documented, complement C3 activation has been implicated as an initial effector mechanism that exacerbates lung injury in preclinical models of SARS-CoV infection.
32360516,Herein, we report the clinical course of a patient with severe ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia who was safely and successfully treated with the compstatin-based complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101.
32360578,The order of treatments may be on the basis of patient factors and clinical resources.
32360578,For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually, cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results.
32360581,Azithromycin has been shown to have a clinical efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ivermectin has also demonstrated a remarkable experimental efficacy with a potential to be used for Coronavirus disease 2019.
32360581,Further, BCG vaccination is being considered for clinical trials aiming to test its potential for lowering COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
32360581,The author also recommends testing their combined administration as early during the clinical course of COVID-19 as possible.
32360583,The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs).
32360583,Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I<sup>2</sup> = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs.
32360585,The majority of patients showed nonspecific symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
32360585,Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently.
32360585,We summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the clinic, hope to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication.
32360679,The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection who had presented with and been treated for acute limb ischemia (ALI) during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.
32360703,Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body.
32360729,Here, we report the postmortem lung findings from a 37-year-old man with asthma, who met the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of COVID-19 less than 2 weeks after presentation to the hospital.
32360780,Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32360780,We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19.
32360780,Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea.
32360780,The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey.
32360780,Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea.
32360780,Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.
32360909,Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future.
32361028,We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes.
32361028,Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.
32361072,After instituting our new COVID-19 guidelines, our average weekly clinical volume decreased by 96.5% (from 43.1 patients to 1.5 patients per week), our average weekly surgical volume decreased by 71.7% (from 15 cases to 4.25 cases per week), and our inpatient consultation volume decreased to 1.81 consultations daily; 60% of the consultations were completed as telemedicine &quot;e-consults&quot; in which the patient was never evaluated in-person.
32361098,Clinical studies confirmed that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could be detected in saliva of human patients.
32361152,▪▪▪ STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission.
32361161,In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32361322,Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1).
32361322,The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, p = 0.0031).
32361323,To assess clinical profiles of pediatric COVID-19.
32361323,A retrospective analysis was undertaken using clinical data of sixteen children (11 months-14 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020 at Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei province, China.
32361324,The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301).
32361324,The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216).
32361327,A few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32361327,Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital.
32361387,Data were collected from 7,236 participants assessed with anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep .
32361387,The overall prevalence of anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms, sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, 18.2%, respectively.
32361387,Younger people reported a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms than older people (P &lt; 0.001).
32361409,Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
32361409,Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG.
32361413,The objective of this report is to better understand the initial CT imaging spectrum and the relationship between clinical characteristics and initial CT imaging features of an imported family cluster cases involving 7 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients.
32361413,We find that initial CT findings of 4 patients were positive within one week after the onset of symptoms and 1 patient was negative before the onset of symptoms.
32361455,Clinical and epidemiological evidence has been advanced for human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus rampaging the world since late 2019.
32361529,We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.
32361535,The purpose of this case report is to describe the radiographic and clinical features of a COVID-19 pneumonia patient without clear epidemiological history outside Wuhan, China.
32361701,Suspicious cases included patients with a history of dry cough, chills or sore throat accompanying by shortness of breath with or without fever, patients with upper/lower respiratory symptoms with radiological manifestations as single or double-sided multilobular infiltrations on CT scan or plain chest radiography, any one that has a history of close contact with a definite COVID-19 case within the last 14 days, any one with a history of presence in COVID-19 epidemic regions within the last 14 days and patient with pneumonia that despite of proper treatment has an inappropriate clinical response and clinical condition becomes more severe in an unusual way or unexpectedly.
32361703,He was discharged healthy without development of new pulmonary symptoms despite immunosuppressive treatment.
32361714,The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
32361714,Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials.
32361714,Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine will remain true to the set principles, values and past and prepared to cope with future challenges in the scientific and clinical setting.
32361715,For his experiment Galen used the random allocation of treatment, today's prospective randomised clinical trial, implemented in the evaluation of novel therapies, widely used internationally, particularly in cancer research!
32361715,According to the Declaration of Helsinki participation of a subject in a clinical trial requires their explicit written consent.
32361715,Perhaps human ingenuity will seek new investigative methods that will render the randomised clinical trial obsolete, both, on methodological and ethical grounds.
32361723,We selected baseline clinical and laboratory data through the stepwise Akaike information criterion and ensemble XGBoost model to build mortality-prediction models.
32361723,The clinical model developed with age, history of hypertension and coronary heart disease showed AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95); threshold, -2.6551; sensitivity, 92.31%; specificity, 77.44% and negative predictive value (NPV), 99.34%.
32361723,The laboratory model developed with age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), neutrophil and lymphocyte count, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) had a significantly stronger discriminatory power than the clinical model (p=0.0157), with AUC of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99); threshold, -2.998; sensitivity, 100.00%; specificity, 92.82% and NPV, 100.00%.
32361723,In the subsequent validation cohort (N=44), the AUCs (95% CI) were 0.83 (0.68, 0.93) and 0.88 (0.75, 0.96) for clinical model and laboratory model, respectively.
32361738,Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.
32361738,Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation.
32361738,Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments.
32361738,Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.
32361738,By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes.
32361738,Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p&lt;0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (&gt;10 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) and neutrophilia (&gt;75 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes.
32361738,We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.
32361738,Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.
32361744,This method represents a useful tool for studying remdesivir and GS-441524 clinical pharmacokinetics, particularly during the current COVID-19 outbreak.
32361996,In asymptomatic patients as well as patients with flu-like symptoms and fever, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the blood or serum despite a clearly positive result in all throat swabs.
32361996,As patients with symptoms of infectious disease will not be admitted to blood donation, the risk for transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be negligible.
32362005,Bioinformatics techniques such as artificial intelligence should be used for collecting the hemogram and serum biochemistry data of all COVID-19- infected people worldwide, even they do not show severe symptoms.
32362061,In particular, there are no current clinical data about the interference exerted by dupilumab, a biologic drugs blocking IL-4 and IL-13, used for adult atopic dermatitis.
32362061,Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials.
32362062,This unprecedented virus has caused global pandemic and over 2,300,000 cases worldwide in total number(2), which has been bringing tremendous pressure and challenges to medical institutions and clinical staff around the world. 2019-nCoV can be transmitted by droplets primarily, while it has been reported that surface contact transmission exists as well(3).
32362062,It is of prime importance to ensure and maintain the skin clean, sterilized and protected of clinical health care staff during the fight against the epidemic.
32362193,Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts.<b>Areas covered</b>: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers.
32362193,Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious.

32362344,This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study.
32362344,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained.
32362384,The objective of this document is to compile these experiences, based on recommendations from official agencies, in a document offering guidance in daily clinical practice.
32362392,The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic remains unclear.
32362504,The analysis of real-life data from hospital information systems could make possible to decide on the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 treatments by avoiding the pitfalls of preliminary studies and randomized clinical trials.
32362504,The different drugs tested in current clinical trials are already widely prescribed to patients by doctors in hospitals, and can therefore be immediately analysed according to validated methodological standards.
32362505,Also, knowledge about specific characteristics of respirators is of utmost importance to select the proper type according to the clinical setting.
32362505,Clinical evidence on the use of respirators is poor and interest in the topic has not been constant over time.
32362505,A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed, together with high-quality clinical data on the use of respirators or alternative devices.
32362564,In Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, clinical examination and invasive procedures on the respiratory tract and on airway-connected cavities, such as paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, expose people to direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation or ocular projection of contaminated droplets, and to indirect transmission by contact with contaminated hands, objects or surfaces.
32362644,Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes.
32362644,Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32362645,It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms.
32362645,Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community.
32362732,Although it mainly causes respiratory symptoms, respiratory failure and death due to multiorgan failure, there is evolving evidence to suggest gastrointestinal (GI) and liver involvement by this virus.
32362735,At the end of December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, given the name of 2019-nCoV, emerged for exhibiting symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32362969,The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers.

32363205,We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020.
32363205,After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32363205,Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks' isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.
32363212,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 following several small clinical trials, uncontrolled case series, and public figure endorsements.
32363212,Here, we perform a rapid narrative review and discuss the strengths and limitations of existing <i>in vitro</i> and clinical studies.
32363219,Re-purposing the available protease inhibitor drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infections could improve the currently available clinical management.
32363221,Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults.
32363221,The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections.
32363221,However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.
32363222,Few information on clinical features and immunological profile of COVID-19 in paediatrics.
32363222,The clinical features and treatment outcomes of twelve paediatric patients confirmed as COVID-19 were analyzed.
32363222,Clinically, cough (9/12, 75%) and fever (7/12, 58.3%) were the most common symptoms.
32363222,Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had different immune profile with higher T cell amount and low inflammatory factors level, which might ascribed to the mild clinical symptom.
32363222,We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom.
32363226,The clinical classification was light.
32363334,We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection.

32363492,An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively.
32363492,The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32363492,Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms.
32363492,In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms.
32363506,Because of COVID-19 outbreak, regular clinical services for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have been suddenly suspended, causing worries, confusion and unexpected needs in such frail population.
32363506,Forty-six percent queried about clinical services; 28% communicated an acute clinical worsening for which a therapeutic change was done in 52% of cases; 17% (those patients with younger age and milder disease) asked about the relationship between PD and COVID-19; 8% informed about an intercurrent event.
32363506,Our analysis suggests that PD patients' needs during COVID-19 emergency include appropriate and complete information, a timely update on changes in clinical services, and the continuity of care, even in a remote mode.
32363506,By addressing these issues, acute clinical worsening, complications and subsequent therapeutic changes could be prevented.
32363615,In response to the increased demand to screen patients with symptoms concerning for COVID-19, we created a risk assessment triage process for our internal medicine clinic that utilizes residents' clinical reasoning skills without direct exposure to high-risk patients.
32363707,In order to better prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2, this article compares the infectivity, pathogenicity, and related clinical characteristics of the three human pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to help us further understand the pathogenic characteristics of novel coronaviruses.

32364677,A liver and kidney transplant patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without respiratory failure was treated in a clinical multimodal strategy consisting of symptomatic support therapy, immunosuppression reduction, use of anti-coronavirus drugs and heparin leading to a progressive improvement of patient symptoms till discharge.
32364793,The manuscript is focused mainly on anatomic pathology; however, the technologies easily lend themselves to clinical pathology education as well.
32364890,Recent epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop).
32364890,SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious.
32364962,This retrospective study aims to illustrate the radiographic characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the correlation with the clinical course. 195 hospitalized patients confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 at First Hospital of Changsha, Hunan Province from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020 were enrolled.

32366299,A rapidly evolving evidence suggests that smell and taste disturbance are common symptoms in COVID-19 infection.
32366319,In their reports, the ICA provided no valid clinical scientific evidence that chiropractic care can impact the immune system.
32366319,We call on regulatory authorities and professional leaders to take robust political and regulatory action against those claiming that chiropractic adjustments have a clinical impact on the immune system.
32366488,Among them, demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed.
32366488,All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration.
32366488,The average periods of incubation, clinical onset serial interval (COSI), and virus shedding were 4.5 days, 5.2±3.2 days, and 18.5 days, respectively.

32366614,COVID-19 runs its course in two phases, the initial incubation phase and later clinical symptomatic phase.
32366614,Patients in the initial incubation phase often have insidious clinical symptoms, but they are still highly contagious.
32366614,At the later clinical symptomatic phase, the immune system is fully activated and the disease may enter the severe infection stage in this phase.
32366614,Although many patients are known for their respiratory symptoms, they had neurological symptoms in their first 1-2 days of clinical symptomatic phase, and ischaemic stroke occurred 2 weeks after the onset of the clinical symptomatic phase.
32366658,We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer.
32366669,Accurate and fast test results may permit more efficient use of protective and isolation resources and allow for rapid therapeutic interventions.<b>Methods.</b> We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test, a rapid, automated molecular test for SARS-CoV-2.

32366746,This article summarized the understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention and control measures of COVID-19 based on the available data and anti-epidemic experience in China.
32366816,In March 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States (US).
32367170,Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected.
32367205,Headache, anosmia, and dysgeusia are common symptoms.
32367615,Molecular diagnostic assays based on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are used in most clinical laboratories.
32367746,We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers affect this important pathway.
32367749,Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding.
32367749,This case emphasized the importance of peripheral blood smear and clinical manifestation, especially in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.
32367765,Clinical characteristics and indexes of coagulation function were collected.
32367765,Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, a Nomogram was built and the predictive accuracy was evaluated through the calibration curve, decision curve, clinical impact curve, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
32367765,Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated to assess the clinical value.
32367765,The C-index [0.712 (95% CI = 0.610-0.814)], decision curve, clinical impact curve showed that Nomogram could be used to predict the disease progression.
32367793,Information included such as general demographic indicators, population data and clinical outcome.
32367812,A gentleman in his early fifties became ill with flu-like symptoms after vacationing abroad and was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Iceland.
32367812,A few days later he was admitted to the University Hospital, Landspitali, due to worsening respiratory symptoms and severe fatigue.
32367812,He subsequently showed clinical improvement and did not require endotracheal intubation.
32367837,While patients typically present with fever and symptoms of a respiratory illness, patients have also presented with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
32367847,The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections.
32367888,This study explored the dynamic CT manifestations of COVID-19 at different times and the value of some laboratory indicators for clinical guidance.
32367888,CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32368429,Radiation therapy is another essential clinical service that cannot afford to suffer prolonged delays without compromising patient outcomes.
32368483,Its rapid progressions from mild URI symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a matter of days is the underlying reason as to why the world is struggling to keep up with ventilator production.
32368483,He was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with no improvement of symptoms.
32368495,As the number of COVID-19 cases increase, it will be necessary to comprehensively evaluate imaging and other clinical findings as well as consider co-infection with other respiratory viruses.
32368528,The gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and the detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid from fecal specimens in a small number of patients suggest the possibility of transmission <i>via</i> the gastrointestinal tract.
32368531,In patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough and dyspnea, are the most frequent clinical manifestations.
32368531,These patients may also present with less well-defined symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort both at the time of diagnosis and during the clinical course.
32368531,In a few cases, these symptoms may also present before the appearance of respiratory symptoms.
32368570,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses.
32368570,The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India.
32368728,Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.
32368728,We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.
32368728,We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.
32368728,We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤9•5 10<sup>9</sup>/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1•1 10<sup>9</sup>/L).
32368728,The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.
32368755,This case highlights management strategies including the use of corticosteroids, an IL-6 inhibitor, and an aldose reductase inhibitor resulting in complete clinical recovery.
32368792,As research continues, we have learned the genome structure, epidemiological and clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2.
32368792,This review will facilitate the identification of potential targets and provide promising clues for drug development that can be translated into clinical applications for combating SARS-CoV-2.
32368800,The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had widespread implications on clinical practice at U.S. hospitals.
32368875,During the COVID-19 outbreak, staff must use proper personal protective equipment and patients should be evaluated as the elective case according to clinical status.
32368875,If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.
32368928,The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. <b>RESULTS.</b> Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated.
32369097,There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use.
32369097,To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation).
32369097,These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32369097,However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.
32369190,Comparing the clinical presentation and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 with previous coronavirus-associated respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV1 and MERS) revealedsome remarkable findings and differences.
32369190,Moreover, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed the complexity of COVID-19 profile with the variable clinical presentations.
32369191,Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, may ameliorate the inflammatory manifestations associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and thus improve clinical outcomes.
32369191,Fever (92%), cough (84%), and dyspnea (72%) were the commonest presenting symptoms.
32369204,During the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has been observed that hepatic injury occurs in a significant proportion of patients, particularly in those with severe or critical illness.
32369205,In conclusion, two models comprised common symptoms (fever and sputum), underlying diseases (diabetes and coronary heart disease) and blood routine test are developed for predicting the future requirement of oxygen support in mild COVID-19 cases.
32369208,Clinical and laboratory data available on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Beijing, China remain extremely limited.
32369208,Here, we summarized the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Beijing, China. 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to Beijing 302 Hospital and enrolled in this study.
32369208,Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected and retrospectively analyzed.
32369208,The most common symptoms of illness were fever (45, 81.8%), 51 (92.7%) patients had abnormal findings on chest CT.
32369208,Compared with patients in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Beijing are relatively mild.
32369209,This retrospective study aimed to analysis clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
32369209,Medical records, laboratory results and radiologic findings of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were collected, clinical characteristics and outcomes were summarized.
32369209,The common symptoms were as follows: fever (25%), dry cough (17.3%), chest distress (11.5%) and fatigue (9.6%).
32369217,This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness.
32369217,Demographic, clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed.
32369320,Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted.
32369320,Rapid adoption of telehealth and reduced clinical and research experiences were important changes.
32369409,At the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the primary oncology clinic for the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Consortium, our specialists who manage adult patients with hematologic malignancies have rapidly adjusted clinical practices to mitigate the potential risks of COVID-19 to our patients.
32369409,Despite a rapidly changing environment that necessitates opinion-based care, we provide recommendations that are based on best available data from clinical trials and collective knowledge of disease states.
32369429,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
32369429,To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
32369430,Academic otolaryngology has historically comprised a tripartite mission of research, education, and clinical care.
32369435,Generally causing mild clinical signs of persistent cough and nasal discharge, the virus is highly infectious and is most prevalent in rehoming shelters worldwide where dogs are often closely housed and infections endemic.
32369475,It is recommended to screen patients based on temperature, symptoms, and epidemiological factors to classify them according to their risk of infection.
32369578,The clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are not pathogen specific.
32369578,Highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests have become the diagnostic reference standard for viruses and translation of bacterial assays from basic research to routine clinical practice represents an exciting advance in respiratory medicine.
32369578,How best to use newer molecular tests for RTI in combination with clinical judgment and traditional methods can be bewildering given the plethora of available assays and rapidly evolving technologies.
32369632,Patients were asked about fever, cough, shortness of breath or gastrointestinal symptoms.
32369634,The National Diabetes Stakeholders Covid-19 Response Group was formed in early April 2020 as a rapid action by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care, Diabetes UK, the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists, and Diabetes Frail to address and support the special needs of residents with diabetes in UK care homes during Covid-19.
32369634,The guidance covers the management of hyperglycaemia by discussion of various clinical scenarios that could arise, the management of hypoglycaemia, foot care and end of life care.
32369656,We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions, stool specimens and breast milk from SARS-CoV-2-infected women during different stages of pregnancy and collected neonatal throat and anal swabs.
32369658,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious viral disease that predominantly causes respiratory symptoms.
32369666,The observed risk for VTE in COVID-19 is high, particularly in ICU patients, which should lead to a high level of clinical suspicion and low threshold for diagnostic imaging for DVT or PE.
32369736,These findings provide clinical evidence correlating improved glycemic control with better outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D.
32369975,In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts.
32369975,Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms.
32369975,Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective.
32369975,However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures.
32369975,A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high.
32369975,This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.
32370116,The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population.
32370128,Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.
32370129,Leveraging the recent Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper aims at proposing a tele-medical laboratory service where clinical exams are performed on patients directly in a hospital by technicians through IoT medical devices and results are automatically sent via the hospital Cloud to doctors of federated hospitals for validation and/or consultation.
32370561,Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.
32370577,<b>Background:</b> To investigate the risk factors related to aggravation and clinical outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.<b>Methods:</b> We performed a retrospective study on the risk factors for disease progression of cases with COVID-19.
32370577,Based on the clinical types, the patients were divided into a progression group and an improvement group.
32370606,Diabetes is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32370606,Not optimizing glycemic control due to clinical inertia driven by fear or lack of supplies may lead to poor outcomes in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.
32370747,Compared to adults, there are relatively few studies on COVID-19 infection in children, and even less focusing on the unique features of COVID-19 in children in terms of laboratory findings, locations of computerized tomography (CT) lesions, and the role of CT in evaluating clinical recovery.
32370747,Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of 76 children were collected retrospectively and analyzed with the Fisher exact test and Cox regression statistical methods.
32370747,CT is a powerful tool to detect and characterize COVID-19 pneumonia but has little utility in evaluating clinical recovery for children.
32370758,Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data.
32370766,While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use.
32370766,This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare.
32370982,They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.
32370983,Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them.
32370984,We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms.
32370984,The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals.
32371006,Diarrhea appeared 4.5 days (±1.8) after the onset of the first other symptoms in COVID-19.
32371006,Myalgia, sore throat, sneezing and the other GI symptoms were statistically more frequent in the group with diarrhea than in the group without diarrhea (P&lt;0.05).
32371192,The differential diagnosis between novel coronavirus pneumonia patients (NCPP) and influenza patients (IP) remains a challenge in clinical practice.
32371231,WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it.
32371231,Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots.
32371416,Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings.
32371417,A 40-year-old man developed acute brainstem dysfunction 3 days after hospital admission with symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).
32371463,Our study aims to present a summary of the clinicopathological characteristics of patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used as a reference for further research and clinical decisions.
32371463,Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients.
32371463,Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%).
32371463,Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%).
32371463,Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%).
32371463,The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough.
32371466,Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9.
32371477,This mobile application offers data on risk factors, herald symptoms, clinical outcomes, and geographical hot spots.
32371536,However, the frequency and clinical significance of direct infection in COVID-19 is unclear.
32371551,This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden.
32371551,The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.
32371558,There are also no clinical trial data supporting prophylactic HCQ therapy in COVID-19.
32371563,Symptoms that may differentiate COVID-19 from asthma exacerbations caused by another trigger may include fever, fatigue, anorexia, or myalgias.
32371564,Information about the clinical presentation and course of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving.
32371564,Data are emerging from retrospective clinical studies conducted in Wuhan, China, showing the symptoms and characteristics of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
32371611,Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission.
32371611,Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score.
32371611,Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.
32372026,Observational studies were analyzed for quality using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale and randomized clinical trials, using the Jadad scale.
32372026,We included 11 reports including 10 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial involving 5249 subjects (2003-2020).
32372026,Because of a preponderance of observational studies in the dataset and selection and publication biases our conclusions, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, need confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.
32372695,Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19.
32372752,A 25-year-old medical student presented in Multan, Pakistan with a high fever, cough, myalgia, and diarrhea consistent with the typical signs and symptoms of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32372784,We don't yet know if being exposed to more coronavirus particles leads to more severe covid-19 symptoms, reports <b>Linda Geddes</b>.
32373183,Although much of this attention has a mechanistic basis, the hard efficacy data for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the management of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 have been limited thus far.
32373183,This review aims to present the available <i>in vitro</i> and clinical data for the role of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 and attempts to put them into perspective, especially in relation to the different risks/benefits particular to each patient who may require treatment.
32373235,CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer. <b>Conclusions</b>: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.
32373237,However, the imaging risk factors for poor clinical outcomes remain unclear.
32373237,Clinical and initial CT findings at admission were extracted from medical records.
32373237,Patients aged &lt; 18 years or without available clinical or CT records were excluded.
32373340,We prospectively collected the demographic and clinical data of the first 38 fatalities whose information was made public by the Health Commission of Hubei province and the official Weibo account of China Central Television news center, starting from 9 January through 24 January 2020.
32373340,The death cases were described from four aspects (gender and age characteristics, underlying diseases, the time course of death, symptoms at the incipience of illness and hospital admission).
32373340,The median time between the first symptoms and death was 12.50 days (IQR = 10.00-16.25), while the median time between the admission and death was 8.50 (IQR = 5.00-12.00) days.
32373340,In persons aged over 56 years, the time between the first symptoms and death decreased with age, and so did the time between the admission and death, though the latter increased again in persons aged over 85 years.
32373340,The major first symptoms included fever (52.63%), cough (31.58%), dyspnea (23.68%), myalgia and fatigue (15.79%).
32373340,The time between the first symptoms and death decreased with the advanced age.
32373467,These patients tested positive on RT-PCR of naso-pharyngeal swabs and developed no fever, malaise, or respiratory symptoms throughout the course of their illness.
32373467,In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained.
32373467,For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.
32373990,A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion.
32373992,In this short report, combined with the progress of preclinical and clinical research, we comment the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19.
32373993,We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
32373993,The studies on &quot;COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries.
32373993,For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports.
32373993,It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.
32373998,Meanwhile, we analyzed the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide recommendations for present clinical treatments and inspirations for potential therapy options.
32373999,Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32374001,This study aimed to provide a summary of the up-to-dated clinical display, diagnostics, molecular and genetic implications for COVID-19 infected patients.
32374001,In this review, 73 research articles published before 25 March 2020 were analyzed to better understand the clinical characteristics of patients and to introduce the available serological, hematology and molecular diagnostic methods.
32374001,Apart from articles extracted from PubMed and Google Scholar, WHO (https://www.who.int/), NHC (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/) were also accessed to search for eligible studies.
32374001,Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms &quot;2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test&quot; were used.
32374001,All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
32374007,Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) by National Health Commission is recommended to follow as it provides detailed diagnostic procedures using currently available tools.
32374032,1] The relationship between these symptoms and faecal calprotectin would be interesting to note.
32374033,We present four children investigated for suspected COVID-19 infection with who presented with acral skin findings and mild systemic symptoms.
32374074,Through a total of 1 485 144 screenings, 64 potential drugs (11 approved, 14 clinical, and 39 preclinical drugs) were predicted to show high binding affinity with M<sup>pro</sup> .
32374074,The procedure used in this study is a possible strategy for discovering anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs from drug libraries that may significantly shorten the clinical development period with regard to drug repositioning.
32374208,If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created.
32374248,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were classified into four clinical stages (uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia) depending on disease severity.
32374248,We aim to investigate the corresponding clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics between different clinical stages.
32374248,Clinical data were collected and compared during the course of illness.
32374248,Fever (68%), cough (50%) and fatigue (23%) are the most common symptoms.
32374248,Significant differences were observed among groups of different clinical stages in numbers of influenced pulmonary segments (6 vs. 12 vs.
32374264,Real-world drug repurposing-the immediate &quot;off-label&quot; prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical needs-is a widely overlooked opportunity.
32374264,Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course.
32374289,We show that an individual-patient-based, beneficence-based deliberative clinical judgment is not an adequate basis for organizational policy in response to a public health emergency.
32374289,Instead, physicians, especially those in leadership positions, must frameshift to population-based clinical ethical judgment that focuses on reduction of mortality as much as possible in the entire population of patients served by a healthcare organization.
32374419,One of the reasons for the rapid spread is that the virus can be transmitted from infected individuals without symptoms.
32374419,Detailed clinical, laboratory and radiological data were also described.
32374430,In a rapidly evolving pandemic such as COVID-19, theories which help unify disparate pre-clinical and clinical observations would be useful.
32374440,The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and de-emphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced age.
32374457,These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV-2 symptoms appear.
32374537,A limitation of the propagation, the understanding of the functioning of the virus and its clinical manifestations, the administration of specific treatments, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are the basis of the fight against this germ, which is still little known today.
32374538,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 range from non-specific symptoms to adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32374546,We conclude with important considerations in terms of students' clinical supervision.
32374806,The authors analyzed stress, anxiety, and depression with the arrival of the virus and the levels of symptoms according to age, comorbidity, and confinement.
32374806,Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population.
32374806,The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued.
32374806,Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues.
32374815,To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests.
32374815,Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (<i>n</i> = 10) or outpatient sector (<i>n</i> = 2).
32374815,Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism and overall clinical incidence of COVID-19-related death, as well as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce it.
32374823,As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins are involved in multiple interactions with NF-kB, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019.
32374903,Physicians should be aware of this characteristic of the virus to anticipate the clinical course of infection.
32375085,Subsequently, the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues, triggering a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes and symptoms, including cardiovascular complications.
32375085,Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment.
32375085,This review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications.
32375150,We pre-sent a report of a patient with COVID-19 who presented with acute onset of symptoms and normal renal function at baseline but rapidly deteriorated resulting in death.
32375150,The timing of decline in renal function correlated with his worsening clinical status.
32375150,He was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration without signs of clinical benefit.
32375197,These articles could be classified into the topics &quot;Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission&quot;, &quot;Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19&quot;, &quot;Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;, and &quot;Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure&quot;.
32375201,As a result, the public health and clinical community are hindered in their ability to monitor and contain the spread of COVID-19.
32375488,Coronavirus disease 2019 may present with a wide range of clinical spectrum and severity, including severe interstitial pneumonia with high prevalence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care admission.
32375488,There has been increasing sharing experience regarding the patient's clinical features over the last weeks which has underlined the need for general guidance on treatment strategies.
32375845,The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some COVID-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings.
32375887,Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids.
32375909,Therefore, we intend to shed light on its potential clinical and epidemiological characteristics.
32375909,According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the gender, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases, and other data of the patients, and carried out analyses and discussion.
32376004,Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives.
32376004,For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions.
32376004,In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2.
32376072,There is an increasing number of reports on the presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in cases of COVID-19.
32376072,To review the studies reporting gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19.
32376072,Those symptoms can be the first manifestation of COVID-19, but whether they reflect a better or worse prognosis, is controversial.
32376072,Gastrointestinal symptoms may be common in COVID-19, in some cases appearing as the first manifestation, even before fever and respiratory symptoms.
32376098,Information is lacking on the clinical impact of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, on people with cystic fibrosis (CF).
32376101,These results may help guide the clinical management of patients with severe COVID-19, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.
32376170,Owing to this particular novel and highly infectious strain of coronavirus, the rapid community spread and clinical severity of the subsequent respiratory syndrome created a substantial strain on hospitals and health care systems around the world.
32376170,The rapid surge of patients presenting over a small period for emergent clinical care, admission to the hospital, and intensive care units with many requiring mechanically assisted ventilators for respiratory support demonstrated the potential to overwhelm health care workers, hospitals, and health care systems.
32376170,The purpose of this article is to describe an effective system for redeployment of health care supplies, resources, and personnel to hospitals within a suburban academic hospital system to optimize the care of COVID patients, while treating orthopedic patients in an equally ideal setting to maximize their surgical and clinical care.
32376263,To partially overcome these issues &quot;WhatsApp&quot; has been adopted to get family members to participate in clinical rounds.
32376263,Four formal questions were posed: 1) Are you happy to virtually attend the clinical round?
32376263,3) Do you think that your loved one was happy to see you during the clinical rounds?
32376263,4) This technology may substitute your presence during the clinical rounds?
32376308,Lymphopenia is a prominent part of severe COVID-19 and a lymphocyte count of less than 1.5×10<sup>9</sup>/L may be useful in predicting the severity clinical outcomes.
32376309,Patients who have COVID-19 may already be infectious before there are symptoms, and 14 days of isolation after diagnosis may be sufficient in entirely asymptomatic cases.
32376359,An mRNA-based anti-COVID-19 candidate vaccine has entered a phase 1 clinical trial.
32376368,Chinese Medicines (CMs) had been used to treat and prevent viral infection pneumonia diseases for thousands of years and had accumulated a large number of clinical experiences and effective prescriptions.
32376392,This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials.
32376392,Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and TNF inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or JAK inhibitors.
32376395,In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. 458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43-68)]; 56% of them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab).
32376395,Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32376397,In the current pandemic era, although there have been many efforts to diagnose a number of patients with symptoms or close contacts, there is no definite guideline for the initial therapeutic approach for them and therefore, many patients have been dying due to a hyperinflammatory immunological reaction labeled as &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.
32376397,Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients.
32376398,A third infusion was optional based on clinical response.
32376398,The response to TCZ was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical improvement.
32376543,Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms.
32376573,To investigate the correlation between the clinical classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the imaging characteristics of multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) volume scanning of the lungs.
32376573,The clinical data and thoracic MSCT volume scanning data were analyzed retrospectively for 102 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College between January 18 and February 26, 2020.
32376573,The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19.
32376573,The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue.
32376573,Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea.
32376573,The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05).
32376573,MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.
32376581,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases.
32376581,The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups.
32376587,In the setting of epidemics of communicable diseases, early initiation of epidemiological and clinical data collection and analysis and conducting relevant researches are essential to the success of epidemic containment.
32376587,We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.
32376589,<b>Objective</b>To define chest CT findings and their dynamic changes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from disease onset to the cure.<b>Method</b>We analyzed the clinical and chest CT data of 6 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19.
32376592,To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving tracheal intubation.

32376592,The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded.
32376593,We collected clinical blood samples from voriconazole-treated patients in heparinized tubes and sterilized the surface of the tubes with 75% ethanol.
32376603,These data support clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.
32376700,Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs ≤4 weeks of age.
32376700,Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown.
32377462,The highest percentage of correct responses were from undergraduate medical students and the lowest was from non-clinical/administrative staff.
32377468,Her symptoms started six days prior to presentation with no cough, rhinorrhea, or other respiratory manifestations reported.
32377468,These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19.
32377469,We report an interesting 2019-nCoV case in a tertiary community hospital with the initial concern of acute pyelonephritis without respiratory symptoms that ultimately led to the quarantine of a number of healthcare providers.
32377559,This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32377594,A 63-year-old male was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), seven days after the beginning of an influenza-like symptoms, to manage an acute respiratory syndrome related with SARS-CoV-2.
32377596,Radiation Oncology made aggressive efforts to reduce patients on treatment to protect patients and staff as well reallocate staff and space for more acute clinical needs.
32377596,The majority of residents were deployed into COVID-19 clinical settings.
32377597,Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy with overlapping clinical and imaging features with COVID-19, however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury.
32377597,We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results.
32377597,The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed.
32377597,Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed.
32377597,All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea.
32377597,Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization.
32377597,As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
32377638,To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19.
32377638,By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19.
32377638,Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.
32377638,Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.
32377677,We frame our findings within an overview of the disease and have also evaluated the inclusion of older people within forthcoming clinical trials.
32377677,Exclusion of older people, particularly those with comorbidities, from clinical trials is well recognised and is potentially being perpetuated in the field of current COVID-19 research.
32377694,The most difficult scientific challenge for this future vaccine obtained in the laboratory is the proof of clinical safety and efficacy.
32377709,All age groups can be infected from the virus, but more serious symptoms that can possibly result in death are observed in older people and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.
32377709,Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative prognosis for the obese patients.
32378030,The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with neurological symptoms and complications including stroke.

32378464,A summary of available clinical guidelines with recommendations is presented, to provide community nurses with the up-to-date information required for protecting individuals living with a number of long-term conditions.
32378471,Current clinical treatment at hand is inadequate to suppress viral replication and inflammation, and reverse organ failure.
32378648,Even though remdesivir was proposed as a promising option for treating COVID-19 based on laboratory experiments and reports from compassionate use, its safety and effect in humans requires high-quality evidence from well-designed and adequately-powered clinical trials for further clarification.
32378705,From India, two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome has been deposited in GenBank.
32378737,In summary, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low.
32378743,The etiopathogenesis and clinical implications of these lesions remains unclear.
32378797,The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project aims to provide regular and real-time clinical information to ED clinicians caring for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19.
32378797,The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (n = 122 [67%]), cough (n = 108 [56%]) or fever (n = 98 [51%]).
32378797,Although the low incidence of positive cases currently precludes the development of predictive tools, the COVED Project demonstrates that the rapid establishment of an agile clinical registry for emergency care is feasible.
32378801,In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.
32378805,This pandemic has proven to be a challenge given that there is no immediate cure, no vaccine is currently available and medications or treatments being used are still undergoing clinical trials.
32378805,This evidence needs to be backed by large randomised-controlled clinical trials.
32378815,In February 2020, the World Health Organisation designated the name COVID-19 for a clinical condition caused by a virus identified as a cause for a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.
32378815,Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented.
32378844,The COVID-19 outbreak is presenting the health system with new challenges, and there is a great need for knowledge about symptoms, clinical findings and course of illness in patients admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID-19.
32378844,We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records.
32378844,Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms.
32378844,Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms.
32378845,Healthcare professionals should be aware that such symptoms may be due to COVID-19.
32378854,We report on two cases (spouses) with SARS-CoV-2 infection with self-reported OTDs, but otherwise no typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.
32378854,A man in his nineties (index patient) had respiratory symptoms and dysgeusia, and was diagnosed with COVID-19.
32378854,His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms.
32378854,Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues.
32378864,In addition to abdominal pain, she had vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and symptoms of pyrexia.
32378864,She had no symptoms from the respiratory tract, but was later found to have COVID-19.
32378864,A number of patients have presented with similar symptoms at our hospital.
32379056,Outpatient visits are reduced under well protected after appointment, and rigorous investigation of epidemiological history and clinical symptoms are needed.
32379070,The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is limited.
32379077,While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (e.g. cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms.
32379114,Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population.
32379114,The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures.
32379114,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32379114,The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.
32379114,The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32379114,This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32379191,This study aims to investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with viral shedding in children with mild COVID-19.
32379191,The clinical and laboratory information of 110 children with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 30 to March 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively.
32379191,Monitoring of symptoms could help to know the viral shedding in children with COVID-19.
32379193,Fever and pulmonary lesions on computed tomography were the early clinical manifestations, and the patient developed nonproductive cough later.
32379199,However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported.
32379199,Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded.
32379199,The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
32379417,The underlying mechanisms for the olfactory symptoms are unclear.
32379502,The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms.
32379592,Previous researches have presented the common clinical manifestations including respiratory symptoms (i.e., fever and cough), fatigue and myalgia.
32379667,In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups.
32379692,The Traditional Chinese Medicine is widely used in clinical practice in China, but many other countries of the world to deal with diseases that remain clinically challenging.
32379699,In patients with clinical insufficiency showing clinical deterioration during an acute COVID-19 infection, we advise immediate (self-)injection of 100mg hydrocortisone intramuscularly, followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 200mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours, or until this can be established, administration of 50mg hydrocortisone every 6 hours.
32379729,Detailed data on demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes for persons hospitalized with COVID-19 are needed to inform prevention strategies and community-specific intervention messages.
32379731,Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers.
32379863,Unlike targeted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR testing, metagenomic analysis of these SARS-CoV-2 negative samples identified candidate etiological agents for the patients' respiratory symptoms.
32379882,Panel members evaluate best available evidence and expert opinion on use of remote and virtual platforms in clinical care, adaptability to alterations in clinic and referral management, and provide guidance on post-graduate impact.
32379882,Several strategies will help address these challenges, including employing telehealth capabilities to continue clinical experiences, and providing trainees with opportunities to continue their professional growth beyond fellowship completion.
32379925,The patient contracted the SARS-CoV2 infection after a dinner with some friends but fortunately she developed very discrete symptoms including only mild fever and rhinorrhea.
32379925,These findings support the potential role of IL-23p19 inhibitors to counteract the « cytokine storm » triggered by the SARS-CoV2 and which is potentially implicated in the severity of the symptoms <sup>3</sup> .
32380026,We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes.
32380051,Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19.
32380051,The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research.
32380051,With regard to infected patients with different stages and syndrome, the preferable potentials and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs were addressed through the comprehensive collection of relevant literatures and on-going clinical trials.
32380051,This study could provide an insight into clinical application and underlying mechanism of recommended CPMs against COVID-19, with the aim to share the Chinese experience in clinical practice and facilitate scientific development of TCM, especially CPMs in the fierce battle of COVID-19.
32380337,Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%).
32380430,In addition, we retrieved clinical data on patients with cancer and with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution.
32380430,None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
32380430,Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as 'One Community' working for 'One Health's.
32380474,They should know hyponatraemia symptoms.
32380475,• Clinical evaluation should guide those needing investigation • Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary • Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used • Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged • Patients with moderate and severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management • Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and social shielding is recommended • In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at three and six months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased • Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce investigations • When extensive differential diagnostic testing is not feasible, it should be deferred, and medical treatment should be initiated • Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery may be avoided during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence • Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients.
32380501,With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemia, routine clinical work was immediately, deeply, and sustainably impacted in Germany and worldwide.
32380501,In parallel, routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured.
32380501,This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research.
32380510,Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against Pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
32380803,We hereby discuss the challenges faced while approaching any case of shortness of breath, or other common upper respiratory symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic era.
32380908,Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) increase of 192% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32381057,The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected.
32381057,Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.05).
32381073,Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults.
32381073,The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms.
32381073,The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild.
32381073,The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms.
32381073,This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.
32381140,Examples include universal masking of providers and patients; decreasing thresholds to test asymptomatic patients; using face shields and N95 respirators regardless of symptoms and test results; novel additions to the list of aerosol-generating procedures; and more comprehensive personal protective equipment including hair, shoe, and leg covers.
32381147,Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed.
32381147,Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a &quot;respiratory surveillance ward&quot; (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done.
32381426,The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
32381430,However, overall similarities in the clinical presentation of these dermatological manifestations have not yet been summarized.
32381430,Studies written in the English language that mentioned cutaneous symptoms and COVID-19 were included.
32381430,Skin lesion development occurred before the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days.
32381430,Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.
32381642,Acute diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is critically dependent on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs).
32381642,While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays.
32381642,Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting.
32381642,Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens.
32381643,Taken together, these data imply both platforms can be considered comparable in terms of their clinical performance.
32382001,Pregnant women seem to had no serious symptoms.
32382146,Precaution is necessary to prevent possible SARS-CoV-2 infection through ocular surface in clinical practice.
32382213,Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32382259,This report describes measures that can be adopted by oral healthcare personnel to minimize the risk of cross-contamination in clinical practice during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32382449,This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan.
32382449,The SEIR<sup>+Q</sup> dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan.
32382449,Effective reproductive number <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward.
32382449,The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.
32382463,However, patients may present with atypical symptoms that pose a diagnostic challenge.
32382743,Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively.
32382746,This paper also reports narrative information on the spectrum of symptoms collected directly from the patients.
32382746,It would be difficult to triage patients with COVID-19 based on the typical symptoms of fever and/or cough, although PCR and CT are definitive in diagnosis.
32382748,Our review summarizes the current knowledge of pediatric clinical disease, role in transmission, risks for severe disease, protective immunity, as well as novel therapies and vaccine trials for children.
32382873,Clinical trials for future therapies are still ongoing.
32383125,Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection.
32383125,We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19.
32383125,We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days.
32383179,We evaluated the concordance between the Roche Diagnostics cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test and a laboratory-developed test (LDT) real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples submitted to the Clinical Laboratories of the Mount Sinai Health System.
32383179,A total of 1006 nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium from persons under investigation were tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine clinical care using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test with subsequent evaluation by the LDT.
32383183,The convalescent plasma containing a high level of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China.
32383234,Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis were also carefully summarized.
32383239,The Covid-19 pandemic confronted us with unknown clinical pictures, also in diabetology and endocrinology.
32383239,Sharing clinical experiences is therefore of enormous importance.
32383254,Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.
32383264,If proven true, this may explain frequent neurological symptoms associated with severe COVID-19 diseases.
32383284,A 48-year-old woman with a past medical history of migraines and hyperlipidemia presented due to severe retrosternal chest pain with no other associated signs or symptoms.
32383284,To our knowledge, this case is the first in which SCAD has been reported in the LAD in a patient with COVID-19 with no other symptoms of respiratory illness or symptoms classically associated with the novel coronavirus.
32383370,Initially, acute loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) was not considered important symptoms for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32383370,To determine the prevalence of these symptoms and to evaluate their diagnostic significance, we (approximately 150 physicians of the Daegu Medical Association) prospectively collected data of cases of anosmia and ageusia from March 8, 2020, via telephone interview among 3,191 patients in Daegu, Korea.
32383370,The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms.
32383370,Anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of the disease.
32383530,Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered.
32383530,A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods.
32383624,The hypothesis has been proposed that patients COVID-19 positive, under anti-hypertensive treatment with angiotensin enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blockers, might have a worse or a better clinical prognosis.
32383624,However, no solid clinical data are available at the present moment to support or disprove such hypotheses.
32383624,We hope that our letter will encourage other clinical centres, even outside Italy, to join our study.
32383638,The prolonged persistence of virus RNA in various body fluids may guide the clinical diagnosis and prevention of onward virus transmission.
32383763,To compare demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes of patients with and without concomitant cardiac disease, hospitalized for COVID-19 in Brescia, Lombardy, Italy.
32383778,Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32383778,A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever.
32383778,Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.
32383809,Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID-19, were retrospectively reviewed.
32383809,Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (ie, P &lt; .05) between discharged and deceased patients.
32383963,The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.
32384004,These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring.
32384078,Limited data are available for clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outside Wuhan.
32384078,This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and identify the risk factors for severe illness of COVID-19 in Jiangsu province, China.
32384078,Clinical data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected in 8 hospitals from 8 cities of Jiangsu province, China.
32384078,Clinical findings of COVID-19 patients were described and risk factors for severe illness of COVID-19 were analyzed.
32384078,At the onset of illness, the common symptoms were fever (156 [77.2%]) and cough (120 [59.4%]).
32384078,In this case series in Jiangsu Province, COVID-19 patients had less severe symptoms and had better outcomes than the initial COVID-19 patients in Wuhan.
32384153,The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance.
32384159,We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing.
32384180,Clinical characterization of skin findings was conducted by dermatologists.
32384180,Out of all, 19 patients (79.2%) presented the skin rash after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.
32384180,This monocentric study shows the clinical characteristics of vesicular skin rashes in COVID-19 patients.
32384251,Monitoring can be used in particular to gather pandemic data and obtain real-time clinical feedback.
32384397,Little is known about the risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in children.
32384397,For cases with severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19, the most common symptoms were dyspnea (87.5%), fever (62.5%) and cough (62.5%).
32384412,The familiarity of radiologists with clinical and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia and their prognostic implications is essential to provide optimal care to patients.
32384516,While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections.
32384798,Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2.
32384798,(3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-κ B/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1β expression.
32384798,Controlled clinical trials are needed.
32384917,While still little is known on the true efficacy of ECMO in this setting, the natural resemblance of seasonal influenza's characteristics with respect to acute onset, initial symptoms, and some complications prompt to ECMO implantation in most severe, pulmonary decompensated patients.
32385130,However, there is limited information about the clinical characteristics of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 or about interventions to control COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers.
32385130,We reviewed epidemiologic and clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 10, 2020.
32385130,After initiating comprehensive interventions-including entrance screening of body temperature and symptoms, universal chest CT and blood tests, and other measures-new patients presenting with COVID-19 peaked at 10 per day on January 30, decreasing to 4 per day on February 11.
32385132,Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed.
32385568,Surgeons have had to immediately react to this unprecedented clinical challenge by systematically repurposing surgical wards.
32385568,Strictly segregating patient groups in emergency rooms, non-intensive care wards and operating areas prevents viral spread while adequately training and carefully selecting hospital staff allow them to confidently and successfully undertake their respective clinical duties.
32385614,At many institutions, the number of telemedicine visits dramatically increased within days following the institution of novel coronavirus pandemic restrictions on in-person clinical encounters.
32385628,Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found.
32385648,To analyse clinical and radiological changes from disease onset to exacerbation in coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) patients.
32385648,We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia.
32385648,Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p &lt; 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p &lt; 0.01).
32385648,There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation.
32385648,An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes.
32385648,Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis.
32385648,• An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome.
32385648,• Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.
32385672,To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately.
32385672,Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy.
32385672,In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.
32385712,While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on &quot;anti-viral&quot; and &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue.
32385712,Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression.
32385829,In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use.
32385829,There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice.
32385829,Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational.
32385858,The mean time period between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the appearance of cutaneous lesions was 19.5 days (range 16 - 24).
32385858,The remaining 3 patients had been previously discharged after clinical, analytical and radiologic improvement, and negativization of COVID-19 PCR test.
32385858,However, none of the patients presented recurrence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19.
32385859,Psoriasis treatment relies on immunosuppression, and although most experts agree that the benefit-to risk-ratio is in favor of maintaining selective biologic therapies, and small molecules such as apremilast, they recommend dismission if severe COVID-19 symptoms occur.
32385891,In this quick review we have analyzed the mechanisms of action and related infective risk of drugs used for the treatment of immune-mediated and oncologic skin conditions during the daily clinical practice.
32385900,IJED recognizes the disruptive impacts that COVID-19 has on all activities in our field, including clinical work, teaching, and advocacy, and is committed to supporting authors during this difficult time while striving to publish high-quality research.
32386011,This document summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging examination procedure, imaging findings, CT staging, the value of imaging examination, and the methods for control and prevention of nosocomial infection for COVID-19 during imaging examination.
32386011,Furthermore, it extends the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 in children.
32386012,To design a standardized imaging diagnostic reporting mode for screening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to prospectively verify its effectiveness in clinical practice.
32386012,After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features.
32386013,To describe the CT features and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32386013,Clinical history, laboratory examination, and detailed CT imaging features were analyzed.
32386013,Two children presented other symptoms like sore throat and stuffy nose.
32386013,One child showed no clinical symptom.
32386013,Pediatric COVID-19 patients have certain imaging and clinical features as well as disease prognosis.
32386014,These characteristics are of great value in assisting clinical diagnosis and dynamically observing changes undersuch condition. <b>目的</b>: 分析2019冠状病毒病不同时期的影像学表现特点，并总结其演变特征。
32386015,The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed.
32386015,The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (<i>P</i>&lt; 0.01).
32386015,The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT.
32386015,Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes.
32386015,Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient. <b>目的</b>: 通过多阶段观察2019冠状病毒病(coronavirus disease 2019，COVID-19)患者的CT影像学表现，研究COVID-19各期CT影像学特征，为临床早期诊断和治疗提供依据。
32386016,The clinical data and imaging findings of the first nucleic acid-negative COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared with the first nucleic acid-positive patients.
32386016,There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the clinical data and radiological findings between the 2 groups (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32386017,Imaging data of the first chest CT examination and clinical data (age, sex, clinical history, epidemiological history, and laboratory tests) of 163 patients with COVID-19 from 2 hospitals were collected for retrospective analysis.
32386019,We reported a group of family cluster outbreak cases confirmed in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, China, and their clinical and image characteristics have been analyzed in order to provide reference for the prevention and early diagnosis of this disease.
32386019,Four adult patients showed different symptoms, including cough, fever, pharyngeal pain, and dyspnea, while the child patient had no symptoms.
32386285,The systematic literature search returned 31 articles eligible for inclusion in the study and informed our recommendations for clinical assessment and management.
32386433,While most patients will have mild to moderate symptoms, a subset will become severely ill, with possible complications including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32386459,Since the beginning of the pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) an increasing number of skin manifestations have been reported.<sup>1,2</sup> Most reports concern adult patients and describe various patterns of skin eruptions, in most of cases with low specificity and no univocal temporal association with the onset of systemic symptoms of COVID-19.<sup>1-3</sup>.
32386460,Pruritus and mild pain were the only skin symptoms elicited, and only 10 had mild respiratory and/or GI symptoms.
32386460,One out of 16 tested cases had elevated D-dimer results, but without systemic symptoms or other laboratory anomalies.
32386464,COVID-19 symptoms and mortality are disproportionately more severe in people with obesity and obesity related comorbidities (2, 3).
32386514,Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway.
32386514,We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials.
32386514,We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an &quot;active&quot; comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or &quot;active placebo&quot;) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386514,Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).
32386514,This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.
32386567,The traditional weight-centric patient-selection criteria do not favour cases based on actual clinical needs.
32386671,This article summarises the clinical and surgical experience of Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of &quot;Magna Graecia&quot; University (Catanzaro -Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic and would like to provide a number of recommendations that should facilitate the scheduling process of surgical activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the risk of infection among healthcare professionals.
32386675,We did a comprehensive exploration of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing which was adjacent to the west of Hubei province.
32386675,Data of patients included demographic, epidemiological, clinical features, chest radiographs of imported cases, local cases, second-generation cases and third-generation cases.
32386675,The median age was 47 years and common symptoms of illness were cough (50.7%), fever (47.1%) and fatigue (14.0%).
32386675,We concluded the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases andsuggested to take more comprehensive measures for screening patients, especially for elderly person, avoid family gatherings, and implement more closely surveillance of suspect patients and their close contacts.
32386804,Upon admission to the hospital, his clinical condition deteriorates requiring ventilatory support.
32386911,An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials.
32386911,In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable.
32386911,Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained.
32386966,Additionally, all the elective surgeries and non-urgent clinical interventions have also been deferred during this time.
32387014,Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses.
32387014,In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19.
32387014,At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial.
32387014,Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria.
32387014,Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI).
32387014,The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g.
32387014,Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions.
32387014,The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations.
32387040,Sofosbuvir active metabolite, however, shows an extremely high intracellular stability So, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could also be susceptible to sofosbuvir and we were convinced to design and run a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (in combination with velpatasvir 100 mg, as add-on treatment, in addition to standard of care) on the COVID-19.
32387041,This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment).
32387041,Underlying this ethical double standard in some multinational clinical trials is a moral imperialism and persistent colonialist thinking that must be rejected.
32387057,The initial clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 may be appendicular syndrome.
32387082,Abdominal pain is one of the known symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019.
32387138,The COVID-19 pandemic requires health care teams to rethink how they can continue to provide high-quality care for all patients, whether they are suffering from a COVID-19 infection or other diseases with clinical uncertainty.
32387139,Overall, the cohort reflects previously described experiences, with increased frailty (median Clinical Frailty Scale score of 5) and extensive comorbidity burden.
32387238,Covid-19 is characterized by weak symptoms in most affected patients whilst severe clinical complications, with frequent fatal issues, occur in others.
32387246,The clinical findings include changes in ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function.
32387301,COVID-19 is a medical emergency, with 20 % of patients presenting with severe clinical manifestations.
32387333,In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects.
32387384,The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used to estimate the contact rates, infectious periods and mortality rate using both confirmed cases (by date of symptoms initiation), and daily mortality.
32387409,Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and &gt;10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (&gt;10 days).
32387409,Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%).
32387409,A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74-95 years old).
32387409,A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision).
32387456,Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females.
32387470,The severe form of COVID-19 share several clinical and laboratory features with four entities gathered under the term &quot;hyperferritinemic syndromes&quot; and including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS) and septic shock.
32387575,The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation and delirium.
32387682,No special factors were found accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms.
32387694,While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary.
32387694,Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rationalise the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.
32387756,The novel coronavirus Covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses.
32387756,Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.
32387778,Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations.
32387786,Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of the ongoing scientific and clinical findings.
32387786,Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons have also been provided.
32387924,The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45 %).
32387968,We evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32388117,Nursing campus courses have also been suspended, and there may be a learning gap between hand hygiene theory and clinical training for nursing students.
32388117,A virtual classroom education approach may help address the learning gap by providing ongoing theoretical strengthening of hand hygiene during clinical nursing training.
32388326,The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections.
32388333,IoT implementation impacts on reducing healthcare cost and improve treatment outcome of the infected patient.
32388333,IoT is helpful for an infected patient of COVID-19 to identify symptoms and provides better treatment rapidly.
32388390,Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but the factors affecting the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well described.
32388451,After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms.
32388458,All of them had two-week quarantine since documented exposure and none of them developed clinical manifestations of infectious disease.
32388469,The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is often delayed compared to that of respiratory symptoms.
32388470,So far, one of the major drawbacks of the available molecular assays for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the need for viral nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens.
32388470,Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay.
32388470,Clinical performances of Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method.
32388471,Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab.
32388471,The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay.
32388471,Due to its random-access workflow concept and rapid time-to-result of about 80 min, the system is very well suited for providing fast-tracked SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting.
32388472,To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020.
32388472,These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)].
32388472,The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area.
32388472,For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results.
32388486,The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapy-one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 &quot;Spanish influenza&quot; pandemic.
32388486,These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder.
32388698,These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology.
32388698,Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.
32388722,Moreover, child's will must not be forced.Conclusion: On the basis of clinical findings, we think that the universal use of facial masks seems necessary when people have to go out in their everyday lives.
32388805,Although these historical reports are of low-level evidence per se, hampering recommendations for decision-making in the clinical setting, they indicate effectiveness in the dose range between 0.3 and 1 Gy, similar to more recent dose concepts in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory/degenerative benign diseases with, e.g., a single dose per fraction of 0.5 Gy.
32388805,This concise review aims to critically review the evidence for low-dose radiation treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy and discuss whether it is worth investigating in the present clinical situation.
32388880,We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 3 weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms.
32388880,She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste.
32388880,The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins.
32388880,Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms.
32388880,It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms.
32388937,<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 in the real world. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 21 to February 9, 2020.
32388937,There was also no significant difference in the rate of negative conversion rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the improvement ration in clinical symptoms, and the improvement ration of pulmonary infection in the lung CT imaging (<i>P</i>&gt; 0.05).
32388937,Moreover, the frequency of adverse reactions in the three groups receiving antiviral drugs was significantly higher than that in the conventional treatment group (<i>χ(2)</i> = 14.875, <i>P</i> = 0.002). <b>Conclusions:</b> No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.
32388947,The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed.
32389027,This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020.
32389148,We aimed to assess outbreak-related psychological distress and symptoms of acute stress reaction (ASR) in health professional students and to characterize individuals with potential need for interventions.
32389148,Our findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students.
32389195,Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants).
32389195,For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5·80 [95% CI 3·91-8·61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2·65 [1·67-4·20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers.
32389373,The clinical characteristics and radiological findings (chest radiography and chest computed tomography [CT]) of nine children infected with the 2019-nCoV were reviewed in this retrospective case series.
32389373,The clinical manifestations and radiological findings of the 2019-nCoV-infected children were mild and lacked a typical pattern.
32389499,The aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and by acquired immune system impairment (immune senescence).
32389499,Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging.
32389518,It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes.
32389518,Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient.
32389518,Symptoms are similar to the general population.
32389615,Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence.
32389615,Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging.
32389615,Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted.
32389720,The clinical significance of this observation is unclear; however, the magnitude of this mechanism of drug accumulation via ion-trapping in lysosomes could be an important factor for the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug combination.
32389847,The clinical picture of COVID-19 suggests a role of ACE2 blockade, rather than its overexpression, in causing the pathogenesis.
32389847,Unfortunately, these agonists have not been tested in clinical studies.
32389849,In the review, we draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis for further understand the features of COVID-19.
32389849,Children started with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe condition and newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications.
32389999,CONCLUSIONS There are psychological symptoms and sleep symptoms in front-line medical staff who participate in the fight against COVID-19, and they affect each other.
32389999,Hospitals should improve emergency management measures, strengthen psychological counseling for clinical front-line medical staff, strengthen exercise intervention, and improve their sleep quality and mental health.
32390064,Here we attempt to coalesce the key knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology to the disease and clinical care concepts in the context of older adults.
32390091,We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of 194 cases coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Huanggang, Hubei and Taian, Shandong.
32390091,We retrospectively investigated the clinical, laboratory characteristics and CT imaging of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 22 to February 28, 2020 in Huanggang Central Hospital and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University.
32390091,The average preclinical period was 7.44 day.
32390091,Except for 37 severe or critically ill patients, the rest of the 157 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms.
32390091,The main clinical symptom of the patients were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 30 patients (15.46%) showed liver dysfunction.
32390091,Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and CT imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19.
32390279,With the increasing involvement of dermatologist in management of this crisis, cutaneous symptoms gained more and more attention.
32390279,In this review, we will describe cutaneous symptoms of patients of all ages in association with COVID-19.
32390279,Although more systematic investigations are warranted, it becomes clear that some symptoms are clinical signs of a milder COVID-19 course, while others are a red flag for a more severe course.
32390285,International studies describing COVID-19 in children have shown low proportions of paediatric cases and generally a mild clinical course.
32390285,We recorded epidemiological and clinical data.
32390367,Although some information on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a few selected cases has been reported, data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized therewith in South Korea are lacking.
32390367,Here, we report the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients in South Korea up to March 29, 2020.
32390368,This article mainly summarized the causes, clinical manifestations and preventive measures of COVID-19 impact on psychology of Chinese people, and presented two representative cases at the same time.
32390495,At the end of the day, vascular access creation is the lifeline of haemodialysis patients and the indication for surgery warrants patient-specific clinical judgement rather than 'group labelling'.
32390694,Informed consent has become a challenging issue when surgery at the time of novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is to be performed, in view of increased risk of the need of intensive care unit (ICU) in the post-operative period and the associated high mortality if a patient exhibits COVID-19 symptoms in the post-operative period.
32390971,Multiple ongoing clinical trials for vaccines and antivirals against CoVs showcase the availability of medical interventions to both prevent and treat the future emergence of highly pathogenic CoVs in human.
32391234,We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment.
32391242,To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management.
32391242,Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.
32391282,Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment.
32391282,Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.
32391309,Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required.
32391369,Two studies reported negative findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, i.e., corticosteroids had a detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
32391369,One study reported no significant association between the use of corticosteroids and clinical outcomes.
32391441,Second, multi-sectoral efforts to offer incentives for those with no or minor symptoms to seek care and to quarantine themselves are critical, which would need concerted efforts from payers, providers, and public health.
32391444,Our institution and radiation oncology department have used telemedicine services for many years; we would like to report on our departmental experience to guide other radiation oncology practices on its long-term use for clinical evaluation and patient care.
32391444,Our institution's telemedicine program provides clinical services for a number of remote locations and represents the largest telehealth network in the world, with over 300 sites and 60,000 patient encounters a year.
32391518,Hospitalized infants were also assessed for clinical signs and symptoms, including fever, cough, and nasal congestion.
32391518,None of the infants tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on days of life 1 through 5, and none demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
32391518,While there were no clinical signs of vertical transmission, our findings raise the possibility of intrapartum viral exposure.
32391519,To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2.
32391519,The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms.
32391519,Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 ±6 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 ±6 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms.
32391651,Others do not show any symptoms, but can still contribute to transmission of the virus.
32391657,The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples.
32391657,The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infections.
32391657,Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
32391658,As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province.
32391658,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
32391658,The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making.
32391663,The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32391664,To investigate the CT findings of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391664,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were collected and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical stages based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 6)</i>.
32391664,The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types.
32391664,CT images of patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
32391665,To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis.
32391665,Their clinical baseline data were collected.
32391666,The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32391667,We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-naïve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.
32391667,This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and registered online (NCT04261517).
32391668,In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.
32391669,To observe the clinical effect of plasma exchange and tocilizumab in treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391671,To analyze the clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of pregnant women complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391671,The clinical data of 3 pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 19 to February 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32391672,The management and clinical outcome of a sigmoid cancer patient with COVID-19 were analyzed.
32391676,To investigate the clinical outcome of patients with moderate type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge by retesting viral nucleic acid.
32391676,During the quarantined period, the symptoms and signs were documented, and sputum or nasal swab and feces samples were collected to test SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR method.
32391676,There was no symptoms and signs during the quarantine period in all 7 patients.
32391719,Given the crucial importance of this issue for clinical cardiologists and all specialists dealing with coronavirus disease 19, we tried to recapitulate the current evidence and provide some practical recommendations.
32391741,Purpose To investigate patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent abdomen/pelvis or cervical spine/neck CT with unsuspected findings highly suspicious for pulmonary COVID-19.
32391741,Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency room (ER) with primary non-respiratory [gastrointestinal (GI) or neurological] symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 on a non-chest CT but no concurrent chest CT and had COVID-19 testing in the ER.
32391741,Cough and fever were more common in group 1 (37/62, 60%, 29/62, 47%) than group 2 (9/57, 16%, 12/57, 21%) respectively, with no significant difference in the remaining symptoms.
32391741,Conclusion In a substantial percentage of patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent non-chest CT, the CT provided the first evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia.
32391742,Medical records were reviewed for clinical data.
32391746,Over a 16-week surveillance period, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs with ARI symptoms.
32391746,With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs.
32391746,Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.
32391877,To investigate the characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391877,Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and compared between patients who died and survivors.
32391997,At admission 61% of patients had fever and about 50% presented at day 6 or more after onset of symptoms.
32391998,Demographic characteristics of patients, clinical presentation and course of disease up to the moment of analysis showed similarity with what has been described in Chinese and Italian literature.
32391998,However the higher proportion of patients presenting with gastro-intestinal symptoms and the high number of patients with overweight and obesity stood out.
32392009,To describe disease presentation and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of Bernhoven hospital in Uden, the Netherlands.
32392009,The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections.
32392009,We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms.
32392009,Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th.
32392009,The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered.
32392009,The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine.
32392009,Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%).
32392009,Over 35% of patient did not have the typical symptoms of fever and respiratory complaints; atypical symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea are frequently seen.
32392009,COVID-19 patients can present with atypical symptoms, co-infections and distributed over various medical specialties.
32392017,Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email.
32392017,A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. &quot;First come, first served&quot; is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits.
32392017,Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one.
32392072,Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2.
32392125,Although 5 participants had no or mild symptoms, 6 had typical coronavirus disease, without dyspnea.
32392129,Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA from a throat+nose self-swab. 3% of HCWs in the <i>asymptomatic screening group</i> tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 17/30 (57%) were truly asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic. 12/30 (40%) had experienced symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) &gt;7 days prior to testing, most self-isolating, returning well.
32392129,Our data demonstrates the utility of comprehensive screening of HCWs with minimal or no symptoms.
32392280,To evaluate early lessons from a remote patient monitoring engagement and education technology solution for patients with COVID-19 symptoms.
32392280,A COVID-19-specific remote patient monitoring solution (GetWell Loop) was offered to patients with COVID-19 symptoms.
32392280,Between March 18 and April 20, 2020, 2,255 of 3,701 (60.93%) patients with COVID-19 symptoms enrolled resulting in over 2,303 alerts, 4,613 messages, 13 hospital admissions, and 91 emergency room visits.

32392331,Epidemiological, demographic and clinical data (when available) were collected.
32392334,Clinicians - eager to offer the best care in the absence of guiding data - have provided patients with COVID-19 diverse clinical interventions.
32392334,Moving forward, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are necessary to ensure that clinicians can treat patients effectively during this outbreak and the next.
32392337,We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures.
32392337,Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted.
32392351,In the current climate, we sought to develop a novel and entertaining online educational method for introducing pre-clerkship students to common clinical presentations in neurology.
32392354,COVID-19 has disrupted medical education on an international scale with clinical attachments cancelled, assessments and teaching moved online, and numerous universities graduating their final year medical students early to assist pressured health systems.
32392389,We studied the clinical course of COVID-19 in five hospitalized patients with autoimmune MG (four with acetylcholine receptor antibodies, one with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies) between April 1, 2020-April 30-2020.
32392389,Our findings suggest that the clinical course and outcomes in patients with MG and COVID-19 are highly variable.
32392431,Today, in the United States, we have a health care system that is designed to treat symptoms, not people-and to do so as cheaply as possible with the dual goals of minimizing costs and preventing hospital visits.
32392559,An important distinction is the prevalence of &quot;exposure&quot; versus &quot;clinical infectivity,&quot; which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia.
32392559,At present, the rate of clinical infection is &lt;1-2% worldwide.
32392562,Since the combination of MTX and baricitinib leads to outstanding clinical outcomes, the addition of baricitinib to MTX might be a potential strategy.

32393105,While some surgical cases of laryngotracheal stenosis may be deferred, patients with significant airway obstruction or progressing symptoms often require urgent surgical intervention.
32393325,To achieve sustainable ICU services, we propose the need to 1) prepare and implement rapid identification and isolation protocols, and a surge in ICU bed capacity; (2) provide a sustainable workforce with a focus on infection control; (3) ensure adequate supplies to equip ICUs and protect healthcare workers; and (4) maintain quality clinical management, as well as effective communication.
32393346,A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.
32393381,Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.
32393381,The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).

32393448,The evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently derived from open label trials and cell culture studies with no conclusive evidence available from randomised clinical trials.
32393482,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a severe international shortage of the nasopharyngeal swabs that are required for collection of optimal specimens, creating a critical bottleneck blocking clinical laboratories' ability to perform high-sensitivity virological testing for SARS-CoV-2.
32393482,We performed a multi-step preclinical evaluation on 160 swab designs and 48 materials from 24 companies, laboratories, and individuals, and shared results and other feedback via a public data repository (http://github.com/rarnaout/Covidswab/) We validated four prototypes through an institutional review board (IRB)-approved clinical trial that involved 276 outpatient volunteers who presented to our hospital's drive-through testing center with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19.
32393593,Based on existing clinical data and experience with similar viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV, the management approach in the context of COVID-19 should, ideally, take into consideration the overall presentation as well as the trajectory of illness.
32393594,Flu-like symptoms with dyspnea may distinguish COVID-19 infection from dyspnea due to a COPD-related exacerbation.
32393664,Because the therapeutic window for hydroxychloroquine in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine.
32393767,However, there is a paucity of further guidance for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who may not present with typical symptoms of COVID-19 due to altered physiology.
32393804,A total of 2,618,862 participants reported their potential symptoms of COVID-19 on a smartphone-based app.
32393804,A model combining symptoms to predict probable infection was applied to the data from all app users who reported symptoms (805,753) and predicted that 140,312 (17.42%) participants are likely to have COVID-19.
32393985,These primary predictive biotargets may potentially be used to treat sepsis in future clinical practice.
32394237,Interestingly, the patient had no symptoms or signs of infection and also had no risk factors for thromboembolism.

32395473,Expert members of NBS extra quality assessment in National Clinical Center of Laboratory (NCCL) give a brief consensus for NBS of IMDs in the COVID-2019 epidemic, hoping that the brief consensus could be reference for NBS of IMDs in the other epidemic areas or periods all over the world.
32395474,Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission.
32395474,There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B.
32395474,We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups.
32395474,These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.
32395487,The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency, but the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are not fully described.
32395487,We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city; and to develop a multivariate model to predict the risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital (ProLOS).
32395487,Medical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed.
32395487,Our study described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city and found that the illness was less severe than that in the core epidemic region.
32395542,Symptoms, such as fever and cough caused by cancer, and the therapeutic process (including chemotherapy and surgery) should be differentiated from some COVID-19 related characteristics.
32395542,Besides, clinical workers should not only consider the therapeutic strategy for cancer, but also emphasize COVID-19's prevention.
32395550,The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative.
32395550,After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.
32395567,Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms.
32395672,Recognizing the need to provide access to treatment and the anticipated toxicity of such treatment, we have developed and implemented guidelines for clinical care management with the hope of avoiding added risk to our patients.
32395673,We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.
32395720,We surveyed over 3,000 doctoral psychologists about the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on their clinical practices.
32395788,The purpose of our study was to report epidemiological, clinical, radiological and therapeutic features of patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted in the pneumology department.
32395788,Common symptoms included fever (100%), shortness of breath (70%) and cough (70%).

32395966,Clinical characteristics and outcomes among older patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection differ greatly from those seen in younger patients.
32395966,Here we highlight atypical presentations of this fulminant infectious disease COVID-19, based on a clinical case and a cohort of 19 patients admitted to a geriatric ward.
32395966,Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population.
32395966,As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32396101,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic with serious clinical manifestations including death.
32396101,The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.
32396137,Therefore, the aim of this document, prepared by the COVID-19 taskforce of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), is to provide a set of recommendations, adapted from official documents of international and national health agencies, on biosafety measures for routine clinical chemistry laboratories that operate at biosafety levels 1 (BSL-1; work with agents posing minimal threat to laboratory workers) and 2 (BSL-2; work with agents associated with human disease which pose moderate hazard).
32396137,We believe that the interim measures proposed in this document for best practice will help minimazing the risk of developing COVID-19 while working in clinical laboratories.
32396143,We aimed to consider clinical characteristics, laboratory data of COVID-19 that provided more information for the research of this novel virus.
32396143,We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19.
32396163,To develop and validate a clinical score at hospital admission for predicting which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness based on a nationwide cohort in China.
32396163,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-GRAM).
32396239,Studies have demonstrated that comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and endocrine diseases, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.
32396239,We extracted clinical data regarding 95 patients in Jin-yin tan hospital, Wuhan, China between January 26<sup>th</sup> , 2020 and February 21<sup>st</sup> .
32396239,Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, RSI score greater than 13, indicative of LPRD, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.
32396384,Besides mounting a massive response to the viral outbreak, healthcare systems needed to consider provision of clinical services to other patients in need.
32396384,Key determinants of robust thoracic surgery service provision included: preexisting plans for an epidemic response, aggressive early action to &quot;flatten the curve&quot;, ability to dedicate resources separately to COVID-19 and routine clinical services, prioritization of thoracic surgery, and the volume of COVID-19 cases in that region.
32396445,Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed.
32396491,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted all aspects of clinical care, including cancer clinical trials.
32396491,In March 2020, ASCO launched a survey of clinical programs represented on its Cancer Research Committee and Research Community Forum Steering Group and taskforces to learn about the types of changes and challenges that clinical trial programs were experiencing early in the pandemic.
32396491,Respondents indicated that COVID-19 is leading programs to halt or prioritize screening and/or enrollment for certain clinical trials and cease research-only visits.
32396491,Numerous challenges with conducting clinical trials were reported, including enrollment and protocol adherence difficulties with decreased patient visits, staffing constraints, and limited availability of ancillary services.
32396491,The changes in clinical trial procedures identified by the survey could serve as strategies for other programs attempting to maintain their clinical trial portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32396491,Additionally, many of the adaptations to trials made during the pandemic provide a long-term opportunity to improve and transform the clinical trial system.
32396491,Specific improvements could be expanded use of more pragmatic or streamlined trial designs, fewer clinical trial-related patient visits, and minimized sponsor and CRO visits to trial programs.
32396504,We report 3 clinical cases of patients in Italy with COVID-19 who developed abdominal viscera infarction, demonstrated by computed tomography.
32396505,Results from all 3 assays were highly correlated during clinical specimen testing.
32396670,Prior to testing, HCW were asked about the presence of 10 symptoms.
32396670,Dry cough, regardless of the presence or absence of other symptoms, was the most sensitive (74%) and the least specific (32%) symptom.
32396670,The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.67).
32396670,The derived testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of two symptoms (fever, loss of taste or smell) was 89% sensitive and 48% specific (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71 - 0.78).
32396670,The hybrid testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of four symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, loss of taste or smell) was 98% sensitive and 8% specific (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.73 - 0.80).
32396759,The emerging clinical reality is that methanol poisoning around the globe has claimed increasingly large numbers of deaths largely due to the press of poverty and the delay in suspecting and diagnosing methanol toxicity.
32396769,Current approved drugs or molecules under clinical trials can be a good pool for repurposing through <i>in-silico</i> techniques to quickly identify promising drug candidates.
32396771,We have also displayed the ongoing clinical trials, as well as a published study that was conducted on compassionate base.
32396877,In this article, we summarise the physiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the implications for breath testing (in both the clinical and research arena) as well as outlining methods to mitigate these risks.
32396947,Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status.
32396947,As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made.
32396947,Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).
32396948,Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care.
32396985,Children/young adults seem to have a less severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 (2), but data on disease susceptibility in pediatric transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy are limited (3, 4).
32396996,In this review, we aim to improve our understanding on the immune response and immunopathological changes in patients linked to detoriating clinical conditions such as, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autopsy findings and changes in acute phase reactants and serum biochemistry in COVID-19.
32396999,The clinical and histopathological features and relationship to COVID-19 have not been well described.
32396999,The objective of this case series is to describe the clinical features and determine the histopathologic findings and clinical implications of the clusters of acral perniosis cases identified in pediatric patients.
32396999,Affected patients had mild symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or contact with symptomatic persons 1-2 weeks preceding the rash.
32396999,While SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1-2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure.
32396999,We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent-phase cutaneous reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32397008,Further research is required before these devices can be considered safe for clinical use.
32397011,We analyzed 465 confirmed cases in Zhejiang province to determine the epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of COVID-19.
32397011,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management data from qRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 17, 2020, to January 31, 2020, were collected, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis for independent predictors of severe/critical-type COVID-19 and bioinformatic analysis for features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.
32397011,Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea/vomiting was reported in 58 (12.47%) patients.
32397011,SARS-CoV-2 showed virological mutations and more human transmission in Zhejiang province, indicating considerable epidemiological and clinical changes.
32397174,Typical manifestations consist of flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea.
32397174,However, such a use should follow a multidisciplinary approach, be accompanied by close monitoring, be tailored to patient's clinical and serological features, and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results.
32397182,Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed.
32397262,Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed.
32397399,Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. <b>Results:</b> There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years).
32397511,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a clinical outcome ranging from mild to severe, including death.
32397511,To date, it is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms.
32397515,Half of these cases developed symptoms before arrival, most of the remainder developed symptoms 1-13 days (mean 4.0 days) after arrival, and 3.4% never developed symptoms.
32397515,Three-quarters of the cases had respiratory symptoms, 44.9% had fever, 13.1% lost smell or taste, and 7.2% had diarrhoea.
32397530,While telemedicine has been able to solve some problems in clinical ophthalmology, the lack of adequate health and legal protection for surgeons and patients may result in an excessive reduction in the volume of surgical interventions during a pandemic era and the immediately following period, thus determining inability to ensure health care to all patients.
32397643,After molecular dynamics calculations of the stability of the binding modes of high-scoring nsp16/nsp10-drug complexes, we considered their pharmacological overlapping with functional modules of the virus-host interactome that is relevant to the viral lifecycle, and to the clinical features of COVID-19.
32397688,The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32397896,This study describes the pathology and clinical information on 20 placentas whose mother tested positive for the novel Coronovirus (2019-nCoV) cases.
32397906,A broad-spectrum of antiviral agents are being currently evaluated in clinical trials, and in this review, we specifically focus on the application of Remdesivir (RVD) as a potential anti-viral compound against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) -CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
32397906,Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective on the application of RDV either alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents against CoVs infection were surveyed to determine the efficiency of RDV in preclinical trials.
32397911,This review highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV.
32397911,Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation.
32397915,Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients.
32397940,In order to provide potential lead molecules against the Mpro for clinical use, we docked a set of 65 bioactive molecules of Tea plant followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by long term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (1.50 µs).
32397951,It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19.
32398026,The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim<sup>®</sup>) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine.
32398164,However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing.
32398164,Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use.
32398164,This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use.
32398268,There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19 in chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans; however, their availability to clinical staff in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised.
32398268,Clinical examination was unremarkable.
32398268,During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever).
32398268,We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.
32398322,Other than symptoms of the respiratory tract, many children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms.
32398343,There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection.
32398343,Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.
32398569,In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease.
32398569,In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date.
32398569,The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%).
32398569,Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue.
32398954,We summarized epidemiology, virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.

32399449,The most common symptoms are fever and cough, which can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or end-organ failure.
32399449,Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis does not decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 pneumonia.In the presence of clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, compression ultrasound and echocardiography should be always performed, irrespective of disease stage.
32399450,During his hospitalization in an isolation ward, he had no respiratory distress or fever but developed symptoms consistent with anxiety and insomnia.
32399450,The COVID-19 pandemic requires social distancing, quarantine and isolation, which may precipitate new psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness or aggravate existing conditions.Mental health service providers, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers, should be available in every facility taking care of COVID-19 patients.Health workers treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and/or distress developing in their patients and colleagues.
32399453,We report the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32399455,The rapid clinical and biochemical improvement following TCZ administration suggests that treatment with immunotherapy can be life-saving in selected patients with COVID-19-induced CRS.
32399455,Cytokine release syndrome may cause sudden and potentially life-threatening clinical deterioration in COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in younger patients.Immunosuppressive therapy may provide important additional therapeutic benefit in these patients.Tocilizumab, a specific IL-6 inhibitor, led to dramatic clinical improvement in a young patient with severe COVID-19-associated cytokine release syndrome.
32399457,We describe the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with headache, hypertension and a single episode of fever with no other symptoms.
32399507,We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020.
32399507,Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5).
32399655,Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with severe disease.
32399655,Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed.

32399719,Case analysis indicated that the nervous system can be invaded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that 36.4% of COVID-19 patients had neurological symptoms.
32399719,Here, we discussed the symptoms and evidence of nervous system involvement (directly and indirectly) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible mechanisms.
32399719,CNS symptoms could be a potential indicator of poor prognosis; therefore, the prevention and treatment of CNS symptoms are also crucial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32399908,The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is sparse.
32399942,Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the COVID-19 crisis.
32399950,During Italian severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 outbreak, a woman presented with a rapidly progressive flaccid paralysis with unilateral facial neuropathy after a few days of mild respiratory symptoms.
32399950,Despite immunoglobulin infusions and intensive supportive care, her clinical picture worsened simultaneously both from the respiratory and neurological point of view, as if reflecting different aspects of the same systemic inflammatory response.
32399995,There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.
32400017,At the same time, in the near future, clinical trials in COVID-19 patients will produce an enormous quantity of clinical and translational data on the control of inflammation, and complement/microthrombosis activation.
32400044,This case emphasizes the risks of discharge location in the COVID-19 era as well as the importance of clinical suspicion, early isolation practices for those presumed positive, and repeat testing, given the marginal sensitivity of available COVID-19 RT-PCR.
32400074,In this paper we report anamnestic data, clinical features and therapeutic management of two lung transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32400074,Both patients were in good clinical conditions prior to the infection and were on immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.
32400074,He was discharged with a satisfactory pulmonary function and a complete resolution of radiological and clinical findings.
32400074,The second patient required mechanical ventilation, had a progressive deterioration of his clinical conditions and had a fatal outcome.
32400087,The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from non-lung clinical specimens, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsy specimens, previous experience with the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the vast experience with other common RNA respiratory viruses are all addressed.
32400366,Diagnosing IV can be challenging, because its clinical features are subject to great variation, ranging from mild cases with slight xerosis to severe cases with marked scaling and formation of fissures.
32400371,This case report describes a physician in the early 30ies with subjective anosmia and ageusia as the major presenting symptoms of COVID-19.
32400371,Two weeks after normalisation of the mild sino-nasal symptoms, the patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and anosmia was verified with Sniffin' Sticks tests.

32400931,He was a permanent resident in Wuhan, China, and began having symptoms on January 29 (day 1 of illness).
32400965,Faced with this novel coronavirus, scientists have been trying to use drugs that have not been validated by rigorous clinical trials, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
32401064,Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for early recognition and treatment of infectious diseases, allowing timely implementation of infection control, improved clinical care and other public health measures to stop the spread of the disease.
32401079,The main areas of concern were: campus-based teaching and learning; clinical teaching; selection and assessment, and educator needs.
32401210,We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32401210,Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography.
32401211,Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag greater than 1 week compared to new daily cases, while searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19.
32401211,Although certain online search trends for this disease were influenced by media coverage, many search terms reflected clinical manifestations of the disease and showed strong correlations with real-world cases and deaths.
32401215,A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020.
32401215,Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms.
32401359,The clinical manifestations and clinical outcomes of these patients are not clear.
32401359,We described the clinical characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatments and clinical outcomes of both patients.
32401359,The experience of these two cases suggested that COVID-19 patients with HIV infection could still have satisfactory clinical outcomes following proper medical care.
32401360,During the COVID-19 pandemic: In patients with cancer with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, consider causes in addition to COVID-19, including other infections and therapy-related pneumonitis.
32401360,Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group; Australasian Lung Cancer Trials Group; Australian and New Zealand Children's Haematology/Oncology Group; Australia and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine; Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases; Bone Marrow Transplantation Society of Australia and New Zealand; Cancer Council Australia; Cancer Nurses Society of Australia; Cancer Society of New Zealand; Clinical Oncology Society of Australia; Haematology Society of Australia and New Zealand; National Centre for Infections in Cancer; New Zealand Cancer Control Agency; New Zealand Society for Oncology; and Palliative Care Australia.
32401361,This study aims to observe the clinical characteristics of recovered patients from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) with positive in RT-PCR or serum antibody.
32401361,The profile, clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and radiologic assessments were extracted on 11 patients, who tested positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR or serum antibody after discharged and was admitted to Hubei No.
32401361,The main symptoms were cough (54.5%), fever (27.3%) and feeble (27.3%) in the second hospitalization.
32401361,Compared with the first hospitalization, there were significant decreases in gastrointestinal symptoms (5 vs.
32401361,Additionally, 6 patients' chest CT exhibited notable improvements in acute exudative lesions CONCLUSION: There could be the positive results for RT-PCR analysis or serum IgM-IgG in discharged patients, even with mild clinical symptoms, however, their laboratory outcomes and chest CT images would not indicate the on-going development in those patients.
32401550,While important and effective innovations are appearing almost daily, there are also some worrying trends towards hobbyists attempting manufacture of complex medical devices with little understanding of the clinical or scientific rationale behind their design.
32401630,Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications.
32401630,We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. <b> <i>Patients and Methods:</i> </b> We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19.
32401630,In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.
32401670,Corticosteroids, through their suppressive effects on type 2 inflammation, are thus likely to restore impaired anti-viral immunity in asthma and, in contrast to non-asthmatic subjects, have beneficial clinical effects in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32401673,We argue for inhibition of the TRPV4 calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema, and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome.
32401673,A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema.
32401673,We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in Covid-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema.
32401715,Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.
32401715,Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.
32401844,Its symptoms include fever, cough, and headache, but the main one is shortness of breath.
32401931,In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities).
32401931,Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
32401989,Most of the infected patients present with mild symptoms, not requiring hospitalization.
32402061,However, little is known about their clinical performance.
32402061,However, diagnostic sensitivity was poor in both assays during the first 14 days of symptoms.

32406369,Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia.
32406369,Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals.
32406374,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache.
32406420,To discuss the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients among different clinical types on initial and follow-up CT.
32406420,The main CT features and semi-quantitative score which represent disease severity among different clinical types were evaluated.
32406420,CT scanning can accurately assess the severity of COVID-19, and help to monitor disease transformation during follow-up among different clinical conditions.
32406522,Currently affecting more than 3,000,000 individuals worldwide, COVID-19 is most commonly associated with symptoms caused by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32406522,The gastrointestinal symptoms, like for example diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, or abdominal pain are frequent in patients with COVID-19.
32406522,Moreover, alimentary tract symptoms may precede the respiratory presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32406522,Here, we aim to provide an update on the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 presenting the symptoms that can be encountered in infected patients.
32406536,In this Perspective, we provide evidence, where available, regarding the general care of patients with osteoporosis in the COVID-19 era and provide clinical recommendations based primarily on expert opinion when data are absent.
32406536,It is hoped that these recommendations can be used to safely guide care for patients with osteoporosis until a return to routine clinical care standards is available.
32406551,To compare the number of patients attending the Urology ED of Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto (CHUP), as well as their demographic characteristics, the reasons for admission, the clinical severity under the Manchester triage system (MTS), and the need for emergency surgery or hospitalization, during the pandemic and the equivalent period in 2019.
32406551,No significant differences were noted between different clinical severity groups under the MTS.
32406594,Clinical characteristics and outcomes (as of April 4, 2020) were compared among control (group 1), secondary hyperglycaemia (group 2: no diabetes history, FPG levels ≥7.0 mmol/L once and HbA1c values &lt;6.5%) and diabetic (group 3) patients.
32406606,More eye swabs should be collected from COVID-19 patients, especially from those immunocompromised, those with eye symptoms and those had a history of ocular diseases.
32406637,Here the clinical data are summarized of the first 236 patients that have been admitted to hospitals in Uden, Breda and Tilburg which were all at the centre of the initial outbreak in the Netherlands.
32406637,This commentary focusses on the clinical characteristics of the patients that are currently being treated on the Dutch clinical corona units, their medical management and the first clinical outcomes.
32406638,Patients with fever with no apparent cause and patients with recently developed respiratory symptoms, whether or not in combination with fever, were routinely given a PCR test, blood tests (lymphocyte count and LDH levels) and a chest CT scan.
32406638,In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans.
32406852,The vast majority were aware of the main symptoms, mode of transmission, high risk groups, and aware of how to use personal protective equipment.
32406927,We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.
32406927,Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support) Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline.
32406927,All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants.
32406927,We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence).
32406952,Most of the literature show that the elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 are of little clinical significance.
32407051,The endpoints are the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of these patients.
32407051,The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of hyper- immune/convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
32407142,Consumers, clinicians, and policymakers need balanced information that is free of commercial influence to make decisions about the best ways to prevent the spread and manage the symptoms and clinical consequences of COVID-19.
32407151,These include the need to embrace telemedicine, advice on surgical prioritization, planning of clinical area flow plans, advice on pre-/peri- and postoperative care as well as recommendations on training for residents and well-being for surgeons.
32407255,Clinical and laboratory variables were collected.
32407255,Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, CXR scores, and patient outcomes.
32407284,Limited data are available on the clinical presentation and outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients in the United States hospitalized under normal-caseload or nonsurge conditions.
32407289,This viewpoint suggested different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations contribution.
32407303,Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms.
32407411,Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten-day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11-20) to 14.4% (Jan 21-31) to 8.7% (Feb 1-11).
32407411,The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID-19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.
32407459,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies up to March 15, 2020 which reported COVID-19 clinical features and/or treatment outcomes. 45 studies reporting 4203 patients were included.
32407464,We also aim to draw parallels between the clinical/chemosensory symptomology reported in association to past coronavirus pandemics (such as SARS and MERS) and the novel COVID-19.
32407467,Little is known about the clinical outcomes of HIV patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32407491,ACE2 binding compounds and 7 antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under clinical trial for COVID-19. iBioProVis and its carefully filtered dataset are available at https://ibpv.kansil.org/ for public use.
32407539,Yet, generating clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of these candidate treatments may be frustrated by the absence of comprehensive trial coordination mechanisms.
32407539,We here discuss actions that all stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem need to take to ensure that the window of opportunity during this pandemic will not shut, both for patients in need of treatment and for researchers to conduct decision-relevant clinical trials.
32407561,Recent news stories have explicitly stated that patients with symptoms of COVID-19 were &quot;turned away&quot; from emergency departments.
32407564,Many clinical manifestations of the virus are described, and new symptoms are emerging, only few cases of patients with skin manifestation were described since the pandemic was announced by the WHO on March.
32407564,Common clinical features of COVID-19 reported include fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath and diarrhea.
32407609,Patient 2 had COVID-19 pneumonia, and fluctuating mental status that raised the suspicion of subclinical SE.
32407719,To describe the clinical profiles and risk factors for critical illness in hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19.
32407719,Demographic and clinical data were collected. 67 children tested positive for COVID-19; 21 (31.3%) were managed as outpatients.
32407799,Whilst there has been a growing literature base describing the early clinical course of COVID-19 and on aspects of critical care related to treating these patients, there has been a dearth of evidence on how this pandemic will affect surgical practice.
32407808,Multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well liver enzyme abnormalities have been variably reported in patients with COVID-19.
32407808,The AGA) Institute Clinical Guideline Committee and Clinical Practice Updates Committee performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19.
32407808,Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms was diarrhea 7.7% (95% CI 7.2-8.2), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI 7.1-8.5), abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI 2.0-3.4).
32407808,Isolated GI symptoms were rarely reported.
32407808,We also summarized of the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID19 CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in less than 10% of patients.
32407808,Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and LFT checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19.

32407959,Our data suggest that remdesivir can benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalised outside ICU where clinical outcome was better and adverse events are less frequently observed.
32408043,However, there exists limited statistical method to estimate a comprehensive risk for a case in which a patient has several characteristics and symptoms concurrently.
32408043,We applied Boolean Monte Carlo method (BMCM) to the Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset to determine interrelation of patient's characteristics and symptoms.
32408047,Research and clinical observations suggest that during times of pandemic many people exhibit stress- or anxiety-related responses that include fear of becoming infected, fear of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces, fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection (i.e., disease-related xenophobia), fear of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking regarding possible pandemic-related threats, and traumatic stress symptoms about the pandemic (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts).
32408047,A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking and reassurance seeking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19.
32408070,The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being tested in several clinical studies as potential candidates to limit SARS-CoV-2-mediated morbidity and mortality.
32408070,Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.
32408119,The objectives were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
32408119,The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%).

32409150,Two outcomes were sudden cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmias (SCA/VA) and cardiac symptoms.
32409150,The adjusted incidence of cardiac symptoms among azithromycin and amoxicillin users was 276 vs 254 per 10,000 person-years with an adjusted HR of 1.10 (95%CI, 0.62-1.95).
32409163,None of the nursing/medical staff presented signs or symptoms of COVID-19 within 15 days after the procedure.
32409210,The patients had all commonly reported symptoms of Covid-19.
32409210,In particular, elder patients with prothrombotic risk factors should also be considered for the signs of cerebrovascular events in addition to infectious symptoms.
32409328,We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews.
32409432,This novel, team-based approach to caring for patients with COVID-19 incorporates a self-monitoring app for patient engagement, monitors symptoms for early intervention, and promotes a holistic view of care.
32409434,At this time, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors should be discontinued in stable patients with COVID-19.
32409434,In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, decisions about these medications should be based on clinical condition, including hemodynamic status and renal function.
32409437,Rapid, sweeping changes for successful management are based on creating an educational platform to introduce and then further cement these concepts through a unified approach to clinical care.
32409438,A targeted combination of psychopharmacology (targeting acute anxiety and panic symptoms) and psychotherapy (relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and encouragement) is recommended.
32409439,The pandemic has created major ethical and practical questions about patient selection and nonapproved use vs use in the context of a randomized clinical trial.
32409440,Cardiac imaging has different utility in different clinical scenarios, and the importance of minimizing healthcare worker exposure should be considered.
32409441,Results of clinical trials and data from the Global Rheumatology Alliance registry are eagerly awaited to gain further insight into the impact of this novel infection on our vulnerable patient population.
32409498,Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 has been confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms), and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications.
32409498,In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications.
32409498,Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.
32409502,Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (<i>P</i> = 0.03) and fever (<i>P</i> = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese.
32409504,Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted.
32409625,We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are 'fit for reallocation' have been identified.
32409826,To assess the case fatality risk (CFR) of COVID-19 in mainland China, stratified by region and clinical category, and estimate key time-to-event intervals.
32409832,This Viewpoint summarizes the strong scientific arguments supporting the use of alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporine A with potent cyclophilin inhibition properties that has reached Phase 3 clinical development, for the treatment of COVID-19.
32409832,They include the strong cyclophilin dependency of the lifecycle of many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and preclinical data showing strong antiviral and cytoprotective properties of alisporivir in various models of coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
32409832,Alisporivir should be tested without delay on both virological and clinical endpoints in patients with or at-risk of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32410141,To analyze the expression profiles and clinical significances for this gene in humans, RNA-seq data representing 27 different tissues were analyzed using NCBI; total RNA was extracted from different tissues of mouse and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) was carried out.
32410141,Taken together, this study may not only provide potential clues for further medical pathogenesis of COVID-19 and male fertility, but also indicate the clinical significance of the role of the ACE2 gene in cancer.
32410196,Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures.
32410196,Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery.
32410196,Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management.
32410196,We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients.
32410196,New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed.
32410206,Background Clinical characteristics of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present differently within and outside the epicenter of Wuhan, China.
32410206,More clinical investigations are needed.
32410206,Objective The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapeutic methods of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, China.
32410206,The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32410206,Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments.
32410206,The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days.
32410206,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group.
32410206,Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.
32410234,Intravenous tocilizumab, an antirheumatic drug, seems to be promising in counteracting cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection with associated clinical improvements.
32410234,We report herein a case series of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were treated with tocilizumab administrated, for the first time, subcutaneously with good clinical and radiological outcomes.
32410245,In our study, we did a retrospective review of medical records from COVID-19 patients admitted to one ward of Tongji Hospital of Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology from 10 February to 13 April 2020.
32410245,On the second admission, they had no symptoms and their chest CT was almost normal.
32410266,If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented.
32410266,The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID-19.
32410285,To explore epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 in Chongqing and establish early warning system that provides a feasible protocol for clinical assessment of COVID-19.
32410285,Prediction model has a high sensitivity and is easy to use, which provides a strong basis for the early clinical evaluation on the severity of COVID-19.
32410319,Without active screening, little will be known about the clinical and epidemiological manifestations which could negatively impact public health efforts.
32410333,The most common symptoms reported include dry cough, fever and fatigue with ground-glass opacification bilaterally in the lungs on imaging and lymphopenia on haematological analysis.
32410333,Current evidence shows an incubation period of up to 14 days post exposure to the virus, and on average most patients first display symptoms on day five after initial exposure.
32410347,In the context of Covid-19, key issues include providing support to clinical trials in low- and middle-income countries, without taking needed resources away from other critical clinical and public health needs; designing recruitment strategies likely to generate sufficient enrollment from groups that have been disproportionately burdened by the virus, such as African Americans; supporting studies designed to improve outcomes in high-risk environments, such as nursing homes and group homes for the developmentally disabled; and ensuring that the medical products resulting from research are made available throughout the world at an affordable price.
32410347,If clinical trials are not designed with equity considerations consciously in mind, the response to the pandemic may further exacerbate disparities in health status between population groups.
32410386,Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD.
32410412,To identify the initial chest computed tomography (CT) findings and clinical characteristics associated with the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.
32410412,Baseline CT scans and clinical and laboratory data of 72 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia (39 men, 46.2 ± 15.9 years) were retrospectively analyzed.
32410412,Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values &lt; 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge.
32410413,To identify predictors of pulmonary fibrosis development by combining follow-up thin-section CT findings and clinical features in patients discharged after treatment for COVID-19.
32410413,Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison.
32410413,Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators.
32410714,The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries.
32410714,The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied.
32410714,The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5-17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24-36) days.
32410714,Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000030164.
32410765,The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to the need for changes in clinical practice, with new strategies to enable integrated care for patients with headache and neuralgia.
32410788,We present a case of facial diplegia after 10 days of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection symptoms in a 61 year old patient without prior clinically relevant background.
32410788,There are few known cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) related to SARS-CoV-2 infection; we propose this case as a rare variant of GBS in COVID-19 infection context, due to Its chronology, clinical manifestations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings.
32410808,The observations at our tertiary care corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms.
32410823,•Waiting for atleast a period of 2 weeks would a prudent solution to rule out coexistence of COVID 19 infection in low risk cases without any symptoms.
32411034,It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions.
32411034,A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms.
32411034,The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively.
32411034,History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression.
32411034,The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.
32411034,History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.
32411034,The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.
32411271,&quot; Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation.
32411313,These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore and support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.
32411359,The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics.
32411359,In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and &quot;non-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms&quot; can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law.
32411552,Anecdotal experiences have shown that imaging characteristics are crucial to diagnosis as radiological evidence of disease appears prior to clinical manifestations and tends to evolve over time, which can be useful in predicting the stage of the disease.
32411566,Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are typically used agents in the clinical management of hypertension.
32411566,The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included.
32411566,Further clinical studies are warranted.
32411619,Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis.
32411770,However, the clinical characteristics of discharged patients remain little known.
32411770,Here, we attempt to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment experiences of discharged cases from Taizhou, China.
32411943,Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality.
32412101,However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32412101,Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications.
32412125,The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection.
32412125,In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms.
32412159,We performed a multicenter nationwide observational study within the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes of the first microbiologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among SOT recipients.
32412159,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (76%), dry cough (57%), nausea (33%) and diarrhea (33%).
32412159,These data suggest that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged SOT recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications.
32412303,Since its origin in China in December 2019, there is compelling evidence that novel SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus, and it is associated to a broad clinical spectrum going from subclinical presentation to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure.
32412509,For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown.
32412510,Main manifestations of the disease include a febrile syndrome accompanied by respiratory symptoms; however, cases of systemic involvement are increasingly being reported, including cardiac and central nervous system compromise.
32412512,In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.
32412515,Except for pregnant women, the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic includes the standard procedures that are used for any patient that requires to be attended to at the intensive care unit, as well as limited administration of crystalloid solutions, orotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation in the event of patient clinical deterioration, and muscle relaxants continuous infusion only if necessary.
32412679,Despite many neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still unclear whether these symptoms results from direct neural injury or due to some other reason.
32412679,Currently, it appears that most of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are nonspecific and secondary to the systemic illness.
32412693,The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics.
32412693,This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.
32412790,This review aimed to assess these reports and found chest CT to have a clinical utility that is limited, particularly for patients who show no symptoms and patients who are screened early in disease progression. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32412790,Chest CT should be considered a supplemental diagnostic tool, particularly for patients who show symptoms.
32412913,While &quot;Live&quot; patient contact is an irreplaceable tenet of clinical teaching, these extraordinary times demand exceptional measures.
32412913,Since the medical educators have been pushed inevitably to rely on technology-based learning, they should not only embrace it but also develop and evaluate its sustainability and application in preclinical and clinical setting.
32412914,Telemedicine is the delivery of health care services using information or communication technology.
32412918,An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases.
32412918,Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time.
32412931,The rapid transition away from in-person examination, dosing and group therapy in an era of social isolation calls for adjustments to clinical practice, including emphasizing patient-provider communication, favoring new inductees on buprenorphine and leveraging technology to optimize safety of medication treatment.
32413201,The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and antibody responses in a large sample of health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak.
32413201,A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA.
32413201,Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively.
32413201,While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases.
32413201,Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms.
32413554,Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated.
32413554,To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders.

32413736,There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death.
32413736,Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels.
32414407,We hope that our experiences will serve as pearls for otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel working in institutes that serve large numbers of patients every day, particularly with regard to the sharing of clinical and administrative tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32414522,Both patients had no respiratory symptoms, they only complained of generalized weakness and were found to have elevated CK.
32414594,To illustrate the clinical course and difficulties in early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients after thoracic surgery.
32414594,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of the first 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after thoracic surgery in early January 2020.
32414594,Postoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records and the time line of clinical course were summarized.
32414711,We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials.
32414757,An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects.
32414757,Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks.
32414781,Measurement of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will improve disease management if used correctly.
32414990,As coronavirus changes the way we live our lives, clinical psychologists <b>Matthew Whalley</b> and <b>Hardeep Kaur</b> advise on managing wellbeing.
32415419,Interestingly, some reports indicate that this wonder drug may be also beneficial for COVID-19 and accordingly, many clinical trials have begun.
32415472,Stereotactic body radiotherapy for early prostate cancer reported safe toxicity profile and a good clinical outcome at the median follow-up of 5 years.
32415473,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a troubling health emergency but also a main challenge for the clinical governance of the system.

32415473,A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms.
32415481,The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
32415548,Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms.
32415723,General recommendations include those to minimise patient exposure to COVID-19, including the use of telehealth, avoidance of non-essential visits and minimisation of time spent by patients in infusion suites and other clinical areas.
32415727,An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to (a) epidemiology, (b) pathogenesis, (c) clinical symptoms, (d) preventive measures, and (e) attitudes.
32415733,The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after one-month stressful suffering.
32415733,HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyper-arousal symptoms (hazard ratio= 4.026, 95% CI= 1.233-13.140).
32415870,Communication between all members of a research team is key to adapting the development of clinical trials to the context of the epidemiological crisis of coronavirus.
32415876,The current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the more widespread use of telemedicine technology for clinical care, and has prompted consideration of its increased use for clinical trials.
32415876,In this opinion piece, we describe the current state of telemedicine for recruitment, consenting and screening of participants for clinical trials.
32415888,As we know, the likelihood of a favourable outcome in this disease relies heavily on patients presenting promptly after symptoms onset and on hospitals providing immediate access to optimized stroke care.
32415891,With judicious risk stratification of patients based on clinical features of their OPMD and with consideration of ongoing mitigation efforts and regional pandemic impact, providers are able to safely care for their patients.
32415891,The COVID-19 pandemic has required health care practitioners to make novel decisions that are new to us with development of creative pathways of care that focused on patient safety, mitigation efforts, and clinical management of disease processes.
32415914,The objective of this study was to examine associations between exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) news, risk perceptions, and depressive symptoms.
32415914,After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms β = .11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02-0.20.
32415914,Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 can serve as a pathway through which exposure to COVID-19 news on mainstream media may be associated with depressive symptoms.
32415915,We discuss possible effects on clinical birth defect diagnoses, routine birth defects surveillance system activities, and epidemiologic considerations, as well as opportunities for mitigating the impact of COVID-19.
32416017,For example, faculty have had to move in-person classes online; conceptualize and offer alternative clinical experiences; and re-define how student performance is evaluated and graded.
32416028,Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified manuscripts and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice.
32416028,Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease.
32416028,Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs.
32416028,The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms.
32416069,Significantly, our AI system identified important clinical markers that correlated with the NCP lesion properties.
32416069,Together with the clinical data, our AI system was able to provide accurate clinical prognosis that can aid clinicians to consider appropriate early clinical management and allocate resources appropriately.
32416121,Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed.
32416154,Using these principles, we then review management of gynecologic patients during the COVID-19 epidemic in the outpatient and operative and non-operative inpatient settings, as well as in clinical trials.
32416232,The organization evaluated its pediatric clinical and wrap-around hospice services and rapidly migrated them to a virtual environment.
32416259,Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.
32416289,The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.
32416289,These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease.
32416290,Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative.
32416290,The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey.
32416290,Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P &lt; 0.001), anxiety (P &lt; 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P &lt; 0.001).
32416290,Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = .37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression.
32416290,Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms.
32416290,Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.
32416370,The COVID-19 pandemics required several changes in stroke management and it may have influenced some clinical or functional characteristics.
32416370,We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019.
32416370,Similar 'symptoms alert-to-admission' and 'door-to-treatment' times were observed.
32416370,In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms.
32416370,Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset.
32416412,Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has a bad clinical outcome, and some reports emphasized the role of cytokine storm and dysfunctions of multiple organs.
32416412,I hypothesized that the damage induced by free DNA is a reason for severe COVID-19, which can explain many symptoms of this disease, such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and muscus plug, acute injuries of heart, liver and kidney, and some special symptoms of COVID-19.
32416415,Numerous pathological, clinical and laboratory findings rise the similarity between moderate to severe COVID-19 and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
32416433,Every single Hospital and Department was forced to radically modify clinical practice decreasing or stopping daily activities.
32416567,While seizures and status epilepticus have not been widely reported in the past five months since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with COVID-19 may have hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and severe metabolic and electrolyte disarrangements; hence, it is plausible to expect clinical or subclinical acute symptomatic seizures to happen in these patients.
32416600,The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene).
32416600,Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity.
32416600,Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity.
32416600,Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits.
32416769,Most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but about 5% develop severe symptoms, which can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.
32416769,Kidney involvement is frequent, with clinical presentation ranging from mild proteinuria to progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT).
32416769,Current approaches to prevention and management of AKI, and identification of potential indications for use of RRT and sequential extracorporeal therapies, are based mainly on clinical experience, and AKI strategies are adapted empirically to patients with COVID-19.
32416769,International collaborative and cross-disciplinary research is needed to obtain adequate evidence to support current clinical approaches and to develop new approaches to management.
32416785,We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls.
32417070,Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%-99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P &lt; 0.001; pandemic training p &lt; 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046).
32417123,In line with this concept, some methodological aspects of the use of the UVC sterilization of FFP/ cryoprecipitate-depleted FFP or immunoglobulins containing neutralizing antibodies for clinical use against COVID-19 are highlighted.
32417123,Moreover, as some of these donors have already been in an induced-hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and DVT, this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of DVT.

32422078,Detailed clinical data of those pregnancies with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Twenty-seven laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) and 24 neonates born to the 23 late pregnant mothers were analyzed.
32422078,On admission, 46.2% (13/27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11/27), cough (9/27) and vomiting (1/27).
32422081,Case reports and case series depicting the clinical effects of the causative virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been published, yet few demonstrate the cytopathologic alterations of this disease.
32422081,We present a clinical-pathological correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis.
32422081,Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intraalveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphological alterations suspicious for viral cytopathic effect.
32422081,However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation.
32422081,This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.
32422178,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are diverse, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32422201,Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts).
32422201,High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms.
32422201,We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms.
32422201,Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations.
32422201,Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.
32422204,We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network.
32422233,The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission.
32422233,Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 17.2%, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 34.8%, p = 0.03).
32422280,A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept.
32422287,Presenting symptoms, patient's comorbidities, and postoperative course complicated with cardiac and respiratory failure leading to adverse outcome are discussed in this case report.
32422320,Interestingly, a prior preclinical study showed protective effects of p38 inhibition in a SARS-CoV mouse model.
32422320,A number of p38 inhibitors are in the clinical stage and should be considered for clinical trials in serious COVID-19 infection.
32422341,The search strategy included clinical date published until May 9, 2020.
32422349,Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.
32422376,We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.
32422384,Based on the clinical data, approved cases are divided into four classes including mild, moderate, severe, and critical.
32422384,This review focuses on currently available information on the etiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and mechanism of action of COVID-19.
32422410,To evaluate the performance of an ultra-fast single-tube nucleic acid isothermal amplification detection assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using clinical samples from multiple centers.
32422410,The clinical performance of RT-RAA assay was evaluated using 947 clinical samples from five institutions in four regions of China, and the approved commercial real-time fluorescent RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) kits were used for parallel detection.
32422426,All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.
32422501,Our objective was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on somatic symptoms among Chinese college and primary school students, to provide reference data pertaining to the mental health of this population in the context of a public health emergency.
32422501,In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively.
32422501,The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%).
32422501,The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild).
32422501,Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms.
32422501,Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures.
32422501,Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.
32422545,Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness.
32422662,This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS).
32422693,In France, COVID-19 wasn't known to cause cutaneous manifestations before April 6<sup>th</sup> 2020, when an alert about possible associated skin symptoms was raised to the general public and the professional social network<sup>2-4</sup> .
32422983,Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools.
32423024,COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies.
32423024,Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies.
32423024,This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32423024,All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.
32423027,Results recently published on the clinical evaluation of those drugs are compiled in this brief report, although complete data are still impatiently awaited.
32423059,Accumulating clinical observations raised hypotheses to explain why some patients develop more severe disease while others only manifest mild or no symptoms.
32423250,Databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on 20 March 2020.
32423285,Understanding these less well-characterized symptoms may help develop measures for estimating early markers of disease prevalence and/or resolution.
32423292,Retrospective assessment was performed to the response and management strategy developed to transform the clinical and academic enterprise.
32423292,The departmental structure was reorganized along new clinical teams to effectively meet the system directives for provision of otolaryngology care and support for inpatient cases of COVID-19.
32423292,A surge deployment schedule was developed to assist frontline colleagues with clinical support as needed.
32423292,Educational and research efforts were redirected to focus on otolaryngology care in the clinical context of the COVID-19 crisis.
32423293,Professional otolaryngologic societies across the world have proposed limiting patient care to time-sensitive and urgent matters; however, limited literature is available to describe how this transient change in philosophy may translate to clinical practice.
32423296,This evidence-based clinical consensus is designed to guide practitioners of pediatric otolaryngology for common scenarios during this time.
32423296,A clinical consensus on 6 common scenarios in pediatric otolaryngology developed with evidence-based strategies.
32423297,Contemporary medical practice is grounded in rigorous scientific evidence in concert with best clinical practices and informed shared decision making with patients.
32423297,It becomes especially important that we continue to use reasonable, informed clinical judgment in discussing the various options with patients.
32423298,Since March 10, the first day of the lockdown in Italy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergency and oncology cases, while outpatient procedures and clinical examinations were temporarily suspended to limit virus diffusion and to reallocate personnel into wards dedicated to COVID-19.
32423324,However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections.
32423324,Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.
32423324,We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.
32423357,We sought to better determine prevalence, severity, and timing of OD in COVID-19 relative to other sinonasal and pulmonary symptoms.
32423359,Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, many individuals have noted acute loss of smell and/or taste, although not all patients with these symptoms are tested for COVID-19.
32423359,To better characterize all patients with these rare symptoms, a national survey was created.
32423359,Most but not all patients had other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 at the time of chemosensory loss.
32423359,Despite its inclusion as a major symptom of COVID-19 by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), respondents with additional CDC-defined symptoms associated with COVID-19 were statistically more likely to be tested/diagnosed than those without.
32423368,We evaluated sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with intubation and prolonged intubation for acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 infection.
32423368,In addition to clinical signs of respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 who are older, male, or diabetic are at higher risk of requiring intubation.
32423435,Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children.
32423435,From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected.

32423584,The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first.
32423584,Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]).
32423584,Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]).
32423584,In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits.
32423584,However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.
32423664,In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.
32423700,We recommend establishing an alternative feasible system, such as self-isolation by contact history in non-endemic community and by symptoms in endemic community, not relying on the PCR examination, to minimize this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
32423700,Further rapid accumulation of knowledge including incubation period, clinical course and types of transmission is warranted to control this outbreak.
32423833,However, several important clinical considerations have been discussed to inform oncology nursing care and practice.
32423888,The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT features in the first three weeks in the common type fo COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Jiangsu Province. 307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan.

32424063,The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an imbalance between the clinical needs of the population and the effective availability of advanced life support (ALS) resources.
32424063,Lacking national guidance or public coordination, each hospital has been forced to put forth independent and autonomous triage protocols, most of which were, nonetheless, based on common ethical principles and clinical criteria.
32424063,However, controversial, non-clinical criteria have also been defended by Spanish scientific societies and public institutions, including setting an age cut-off value for unilaterally withholding ALS, using 'social utility' criteria, prioritising healthcare professionals or using 'first come, first served' policies.
32424063,The problems posed by subjective, non-clinical criteria will also be discussed.
32424327,We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) from December 20, 2019 to April 6, 2020, providing information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, and tears.

32425007,Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19.
32425008,Recent articles have uncovered genomic characteristics and clinical features of COVID-19 (Chan et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), while our understanding of COVID-19 is still limited.
32425008,Here, we examined two cases in which nucleic acid test results were inconsistent with clinical and radiological findings, leading to suboptimal care.
32425010,In accordance with the national standard &quot;Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016),&quot; we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.
32425013,Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy.
32425014,In some cases, cardiovascular symptoms can also be the first and only manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32425152,We review the most promising candidate medicines, including available evidence, clinical recommendations and current options for access.

32425429,On the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, it has been acknowledged by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) emergency COVID-19 and the National Health Service England (NHSE) guidelines to manage urgent orthopaedic and trauma conditions pragmatically balancing optimum treatment of patients against clinical safety with resource utilization .
32425470,The virus, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (2-SARS-CoV-2), is particularly virulent in the elderly who can develop symptoms and become mortally ill within days of contracting the virus.
32425470,To date, most of the medical literature, including Center for Disease Control guidelines, has relied on three necessary symptoms in making the diagnosis of COVID-19: fever, cough and shortness of breath.
32425470,We present four cases of elderly patients who developed altered mental status as their presenting symptom without associated fever or respiratory symptoms.
32425487,Stress, sleep disorders and depressive symptoms stand out.
32425491,The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.
32425636,Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved.
32425636,The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21).
32425638,With no specific treatments being available for treating COVID-19 patients, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical on a range of antiviral drug regimens, biologics, repurposed drugs in various combinations.
32425646,We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection.
32425646,Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed.
32425646,Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded.
32425646,Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status.
32425646,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization.
32425648,The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed.
32425648,However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased.
32425648,Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection.
32425649,However, the clinical characteristics and co-infection with other respiratory pathogens of patients with COVID-19 and the factors associated with severity of COVID-19 are still limited.
32425651,Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.
32425653,There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases.
32425653,This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility.
32425657,In response, many EUA assays have become available for clinical laboratories, and more recently, the point of care device, Abbott ID NOW.
32425712,This paper presents an evidence-based strategy for improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19.
32425712,These two aspects of the disease suggest two different patterns of clinical emphasis that seem on the surface to be not entirely concordant.
32425712,Thus, one clinical strategy involves supporting patient innate and adaptive immune responses early in the time course of illness, with the goal of improving the timeliness, readiness, and robustness of both the innate and adaptive immune responses.
32425712,Thus, the second clinical strategy is to prevent or mitigate excessive inflammatory response to prevent the cytokine storm associated with high mortality risk.
32425712,Clinical support for immune system pathogen clearance mechanisms involves obligate activation of immune response components that are inherently inflammatory.
32425712,This puts the goals of the first clinical strategy (immune activation) potentially at odds with the goals of the second strategy(mitigation of proinflammatory effects).
32425713,Therefore, in response to the estimated potential impact of COVID-19 on Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Johns Hopkins Medicine International), several initiatives were taken by the hospital's inpatient pharmacy department with focus on infection control, staffing, meeting clinical operational challenges, ethics, increased utilization of automation, and maintenance of employee wellness to prepare for this challenge.
32425713,The key focus areas include development of an institutionalized COVID-19 protocol, measures to improve infection control when handling and dispensing medications, modified staffing plan, system changes in peri-operative areas, keeping pharmacy professionals updated about new and scientific researches, increased utilization of automation, clinical interventions by pharmacist ensuring appropriate utilization of medications while monitoring for drug-drug interactions, adverse drug event prevention, and preparing for handling drug shortages.
32425950,Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than 800/μL may still require urgent intervention, even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.
32425996,However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others.
32426001,Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here.
32426001,The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
32426001,Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died.
32426066,Concerns regarding conferences/networking opportunities (63%), clinical experience (59%), and board exam scores (42%) were most frequently cited. 76% of M3s reported at least one cancelled/postponed neurosurgery rotation.
32426089,This compact overview of recommendations by the EUFOREA expert teams on allergic airway diseases and AIT is based on investigation of the current COVID-19 literature in association with the key words above and shared clinical experience of the experts involved.
32426090,A registry of cases of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma, including those treated with biologics, will help to address a clinical challenge where we have more questions than answers.
32426099,This tool aims to help behavior analysts make thoughtful clinical decisions to maintain continuity of care for the vulnerable population with autism spectrum disorders, while adhering to safety measures that provide protection to society.
32426111,This document will highlight some of the issues facing providers, patients, and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in real-time as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and is intended to share expected common clinical scenarios and best clinical practices to help the community at-large.
32426200,We noted a correlation between cytokine release, encephalopathy, and the onset of stroke symptoms.
32426209,However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis.
32426209,Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. : In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. : Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia.
32426209,He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms. : This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients.
32426220,Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention.
32426220,Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: 1) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), 2) Chronic Venous Disease (CVD), 3) Vascular anomalies, 4) Venous trauma 5) Venous compression and 6) Lymphatic disease.
32426220,VELTAS aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency.
32426303,Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV2 infection.
32426303,Patients with COVID 19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET-CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET-CT studies.
32426374,We reviewed the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of COVID-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in previous clinical trials with positive outcomes.
32426374,We recommend to take the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy as references in the management of COVID-19 and conduct related clinical trials, while the clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or <i>in vitro</i> drug screening should proceed with caution due to unguaranteed efficacy and safety profiles.
32426441,Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient's wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition.
32426556,We synthesized information from clinical evidence, existing recommendations from the NCCN, and variations in practice between multiple academic tertiary cancer centers to develop the proposed guidance.
32426560,The patient displayed no fever or upper respiratory tract signs or symptoms.
32426560,Patient was tested positive for Covid 19 virus and later during hospitalization developed more typical fever and respiratory symptoms that were managed medically.
32426575,•The risk of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 is substantial•Pulmonary embolism should be considered in cases of clinical deterioration•Management of clot in transit is controversial.
32426576,Furthermore, anaesthesiologic, surgical and clinical data were evaluated in both groups.
32426653,Several case series from Italy and China have highlighted the lung ultrasound findings of this disease process and may demonstrate its clinical utility during the current pandemic.
32426653,A multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) evaluation was used on the return visit and assisted clinical decision-making.
32426653,We believe that when applied efficiently and safely a POCUS exam can reduce clinical uncertainty and potentially limit the use of other imaging modalities when treating patients with COVID-19.
32426749,Data selection included preclinical and clinical studies detailing neurologic manifestations of viral respiratory infections.
32426749,Having an understanding of the direct neurotropism of such viruses is imperative to understanding pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and potential treatment paradigms aimed at improving morbidity and mortality.
32426751,This review will briefly examine the clinical presentation and important immunology of viral pneumonia with a focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019).
32426751,Given the rapidly emerging pandemic associated with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing coronavirus disease 2019, it is important to review the clinical presentation and immunologic changes associated with viral pneumonia.
32426751,Symptoms of viral pneumonia include common respiratory tract infection symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
32426751,Coronavirus disease 2019 clinical presentation is typical of viral pneumonia with an increased prevalence of early pulmonary infiltrates and lymphopenia.
32426755,We propose that this dynamic situation calls for a parallel &quot;Clinical Distancing&quot; in which we as a medical culture go against many of our fundamental instincts and, at least in the short term, begin to reduce unnecessary patient-care contacts for the benefit of our patients and our ability to continue to provide care to those who need it most.
32426755,In this commentary, we provide specific recommendations for the rapid implementation of clinical distancing techniques.
32426897,A prominent clinical feature of severe Covid-19 infection is respiratory failure associated with pulmonary coagulopathy.
32426957,The paper reviews aspects of COVID-19 that pertain to rheumatology, including symptoms and signs akin to those observed in rheumatic disorders, risk of infection or severe course of the disease in patients with a pre-existing rheumatic disease and those receiving antirheumatic or immunosuppressive medication as well as potential applications of antirheumatic or anticytokine therapeutic strategies that are already applied in rheumatology (including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, baricitinib, and others) for patients with COVID-19.
32427000,<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> The aim of this study was to provide recommendations for improving the design of subsequent studies through analysis of the registered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical trials.<b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> A retrospective analysis of 189 trials retrievals achieved on February 20, 2020.<b> <i>Results:</i> </b> A total of 189 trials are included in the study.
32427000,Primary outcome type most used: 45.8% with clinical characteristics and 21.4% with virological.
32427000,Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.
32427134,It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms.
32427166,The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials.
32427166,Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment.
32427171,This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients.
32427173,A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) causing acute illness with severe symptoms has been isolated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32427184,Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation.
32427184,In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the advanced pharmacy practice experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia.
32427216,All patients undergo a clinical and virologic diagnostic process before admittance and receive psychosomatic psychotherapeutic inpatient care, possibly beginning under quarantine conditions.
32427279,An early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.
32427334,Analysis of daily samples from six patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike antibodies appearing between day 8 and day 14 after initial symptoms.
32427361,The clinical severity ranged from mild to requiring hospitalization.
32427403,Clinical features of patients, ventilator withdrawal after tracheostomy, surgical complications, and nosocomial infection of the health care workers associated with the tracheostomy were analyzed.
32427529,<i>In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering routine clinical care.
32427569,Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with 12% of total coronavirus cases confirmed among them recently. 80% of the infected persons show only mild, moderate symptoms or stay asymptomatic.
32427582,This study addressed the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19.
32427582,Sixty-nine COVID-19 patients were classified into as severe and non-severe groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics.
32427582,A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions.
32427613,This study is to summarize the clinical features, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics, and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32427613,Clinical records, laboratory results, ventilator parameters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related data were abstracted from the medical records.
32427637,In addition, COVID-19 has many cardiovascular complications that affect the clinical course of patients.
32427773,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented stresses on modern medical systems, overwhelming the resource infrastructure in numerous countries while presenting a unique series of pathophysiologic clinical findings.
32427773,All five patients appeared to have an improved respiratory status following tPA administration: one patient had an initial marked improvement that partially regressed after several hours, one patient had transient improvements that were not sustained, and three patients had sustained clinical improvements following tPA administration.
32427774,Clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy would further serve to underscore the efficacy and utility of this therapy.
32427809,These patients may have compromised physiological reserve to withstand the insult of surgical intervention before reaching clinical instability.
32427924,In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19.
32427924,When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.
32428080,Given the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited tools for orienting interventions in surveillance, control, and clinical care, the current article aims to identify areas with greater vulnerability to severe cases of the disease in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a city characterized by huge social and spatial heterogeneity.
32428085,We also make suggestions for immunocompromised patients' support in this new emerging context of clinical dental practice.
32428085,Cross infection control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for immunocompetent ones.
32428085,However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room.
32428112,Multidisciplinary teams must be attentive to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 so that decision-making is oriented and assertive for the management of the mother and newborn in both the hospital setting and at hospital discharge.
32428113,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases.
32428144,A presentation can be divided into mild (fever, fatigue, cough, myalgia, and sputum) and severe (cyanosis, dyspnoea, tachypnea, chest pain, hypoxemia and need for clinical measurement) and has an estimated estimate of 2%.allows the detection of viral load in CRP-TR of patients with high clinical suspicion.
32428290,This article presents a case of a pregnant woman from Wuhan infected with SARS-CoV-2, including her symptoms, pregnancy outcome, and treatment strategy.
32428291,Most patients have mild influenza-like symptoms.
32428835,In this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.
32428864,Further clinical trials in this regard can reveal a more definite conclusion against the COVID-19 disaster.
32428865,We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
32428865,We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as &quot;Remdesivir&quot; or 'GS-5734″ AND &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
32428957,For seven days now, the man has fever, dry cough und physical weakness and the wife has similar symptoms of a milder form.
32428957,The clinical examination shows fine crackles over both lungs and a respiratory failure of the husband.
32428964,Initially, nasopharyngeal testing was performed only on women with a positive screen (symptoms or exposure) but subsequently, testing was universally performed on all women admitted to labor and delivery.
32428964,Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [<i>n</i> = 60] or exposure only [<i>n</i> = 21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic).
32428964,Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women.
32428964,It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms.
32428964,· Respiratory support is often needed for women who present with symptoms..
32428964,· Low rate of severe disease in women who present without symptoms..
32428965,Pregnant women have been historically excluded from clinical trials for nonobstetric conditions, even during prior epidemics.
32428965,Among 621,370 trials in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, 927 (0.15%) were COVID-19 related.
32429038,We retrieved data on the clinical features and primary composite end point of COVID-19 patients from Medline and Embase which had been released from inception by the April 16, 2020.
32429038,This will lead to better clinical management and inform the process of implementing more stringent preventative measures for this group of patients.
32429041,Our early understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 has been based on case series emerging from the first outbreak in Wuhan.
32429041,Gastrointestinal symptoms were rarely reported as a key feature.
32429041,We present a case report of a 74-year-old male who presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.
32429099,Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia.
32429099,In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.
32429101,With the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays, saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis, disease management, and control of Covid-19.
32429193,The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice.
32429193,Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms.
32429193,Almost 85% of the dentists reported being worried of contracting the infection during clinical activity.
32429235,By addressing this, we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential, by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise, in part, to known associations between metabolic disease, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, sleep-disordered breathing, pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32429249,We searched for and summarised clinically relevant topics that could help making clinical decisions.
32429249,This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
32429249,While respective guidelines on these topics will serve clinicians in clinical practice, regularly updating all guidelines concerning COVID-19 will be a necessary, although challenging task in the upcoming weeks and months.
32429580,Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that is currently undergoing extensive clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.
32429714,The simulation training objective of this study was to enhance the neonatal, maternity, and anesthetics teams' preparedness for the management of the emergency delivery of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.<b>Methods:</b> Three clinical simulation training sessions were conducted in March 2020 at the University Hospital Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.
32429714,The neonatal, maternity, and anesthetics clinical teams participated in these joint training sessions in the obstetric emergency theater.<b>Results:</b> Each session lasted for around an hour.
32429714,The key changes were: first, floor plan adjustment, increase of the clinical area by converting some offices to clinical spaces, and standard operating procedures for transporting patients; second, enhancement of the efficiency of the communication and coordination between the clinical teams; third, availability of extra support for the staff in the Central Delivery Suite (CDS); and fourth, introduction of a neonatal care pathway to manage neonatal resuscitation in such an emergency.<b>Conclusions:</b> Collaboration and joint training between the different clinical teams involved in the care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients was proven to be one of the most effective ways of improving performance.
32429769,<b> <i>Introduction:</i> </b> <i>During the current pandemic, measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus exposure has severely impacted the delivery of outpatient clinical care to patients with a chronic neurological condition.
32429774,This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19.
32429774,COVID-19 patients present special challenges due to rapidly changing clinical status.
32429780,<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 is a novel type of the coronavirus family with an incompletely described clinical course.
32429780,While the clinical evidence was growing rapidly, this data may guide obstetricians and midwives to perceive what accurate information should be provided to the pregnant women.
32429786,Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.
32430088,In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases.
32430154,Development of hypolipidemia begins in patients with mild symptoms.
32430286,Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease.
32430286,Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32430286,Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course.
32430428,We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without.
32430617,Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them.
32430617,COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations.
32430621,We report here the description of a multicenter retrospective-prospective observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN), involving the Italian Neurological Departments, who will consecutively recruit patients with neurological symptoms and/or signs, occurred at the onset or as a complication of COVID-19.
32430621,Outpatients with clinical signs of COVID and neurological manifestations will be also referred to participating neurologists from primary care physicians.
32430621,A comprehensive data collection, in the form of electronic case report form (eCRF), will register all possible neurological manifestations involving central nervous systems, peripheral nerves, and muscles, together with clinical, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid, if available), imaging, neurological, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological data.
32430627,Furthermore, patients with existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease, have a worse clinical outcome following contraction of the viral illness.
32430627,We will finally discuss the impact of clinically available CV drugs on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients.
32430637,The coronavirus pandemic that started in December 2019 is mainly related to clinical pictures consistent with respiratory symptoms; nevertheless, reports about neurological complications have recently appeared in the medical literature.
32430637,We describe a case of a 36-year-old coronavirus-positive patient that was admitted on emergency basis; his clinical presentation included neurological symptoms such as drowsiness and mild confusion.
32430651,In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
32430651,Yet, it has been claimed that both ARBs and ACE-Is could result potentially useful in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
32430651,Older COVID-19-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or ACE-Is.
32430651,Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies.
32430651,Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.
32430840,We employed a multivariate prediction model, based on up-to-date transmission and clinical parameters, to simulate outbreak trajectories in 16 countries, from diverse regions and economic categories.
32430840,Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.
32430957,Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient being pregnant on admission and availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcome.
32430957,The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath, fatigue and myalgia.
32430964,Data on viral loads were scarce, but indicated that children may have lower levels than adults, partly because they often have fewer symptoms, and this should decrease the transmission risk.
32430996,The main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is the presence of respiratory symptoms, but some patients develop severe cardiovascular and renal complications.
32430996,This review provides a basis for further research and development of clinical applications of curcumin for the treatment of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.
32431118,The disease is more severe in the older population, whereas in children lower infection rates and milder symptoms are more common.
32431118,Severe symptoms in the pediatric population, although uncommon, have been reported mainly in infants younger than 1 year of age.
32431120,Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one's medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma.
32431134,Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs.
32431217,Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.
32431755,The low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (LMWF5A), a novel biologic in development for osteoarthritis, demonstrates beneficial in vitro immunomodulatory effects complimentary to addressing inflammation, thus, we hypothesize that LMWF5A could improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 by attenuating hyperinflammation and the potential development of a cytokine storm.
32431992,We present a case of a 41-year-old female, with no significant medical history and no recent history of exposure to sick contacts, presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, severe shortness of breath, and flu-like symptoms with a positive COVID-19 test.
32432121,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical characteristics and dynamic follow-up changes of high resolution CT (HRCT) in 270 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 146 males and 124 females, with median age of 51 (9,89).
32432121,The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive.
32432121,During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.
32432217,To date the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to 48 COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and 21 high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests, as well as implemented policies that give broad authority to clinical laboratories and commercial manufacturers in the development, distribution, and use of COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
32432389,In this work, we review its major impacts on procedures and workflow of clinical physics tasks, and suggest alternate pathways to avoid major disruption or discontinuity of physics tasks in the context of small, medium, and large radiation oncology clinics.
32432389,Three models of facilities characterized by the number of clinical physicists, daily patient throughput, and equipment were identified for this purpose.
32432389,For identical objectives of continuity of clinical operations, with constraints such as social distancing and unavailability of staff due to system strain, however with the possibility of remote operations, the performance of these models was investigated.
32432389,General clinical tasks requiring on-site personnel presence or otherwise were evaluated to determine the scalability of the three models at this point in the course of disease spread within their surroundings.
32432389,The clinical physics tasks within three models could be divided into two categories.
32432527,Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results.
32432953,I aim to share my thoughts as an unsettled 4th year medical student about to embark on my first set of clinical exams conducted in this format.
32432953,The luxury of reference will not be afforded in all clinical settings thus leading to concerns regarding students skimming over essential learning points.
32432996,However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.
32432996,We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls).
32433010,In this review, we summarize demographic data, clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes and finally prevention and control of this serious pandemic.
32433161,The patient was currently asymptomatic and without clinical evidence of active pneumonia.
32433162,Meanwhile, the patient's symptoms worsened, and a blood test later confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32433168,A retrospective review of her clinical and laboratory data was strongly suggestive for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
32433216,Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated.
32433217,Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
32433226,HCoVs detected in children with acute gastroenteritis have included 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in children.
32433226,Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases.
32433226,It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.
32433251,Plan adoption is, however, challenged by the need to coordinate with institutional efforts, a rapidly expanding number of patients, and the diversity of clinical and administrative functions in the department.
32433260,In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas.
32433342,Here we provide a review of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system to assist clinical cardiologists to better understand the disease and being capable of providing comprehensive medical support.
32433345,To date, several direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have demonstrated promising in vitro and clinical efficacy.
32433364,These cases highlight an important opportunity to provide access to life-saving OUD treatment for vulnerable patients in the setting of a pandemic that mandates reduced face-to-face clinical interactions.
32433453,To investigate the clinical evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized pregnant women and potential factors associated with severe maternal outcomes.
32433453,Clinical records, laboratory and radiologic examinations, and pregnancy outcomes were collected.
32433465,We have previously engineered a synthetic DNA vaccine targeting the MERS coronavirus Spike (S) protein, the major surface antigen of coronaviruses, which is currently in clinical study.
32433778,Several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties (tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, anakinra, among others) have been suggested as adjuncts to supportive care in the management of COVID-19, and several clinical trials are underway (NCT04315298, NCT04317092, NCT04306705).
32433799,SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the disease, is a single-stranded RNA virus which can cause a wide clinical spectrum of symptoms.
32434058,The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management.
32434093,Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia.
32434108,The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screened for COVID-19 infection.
32434211,Here we analyzed the clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai.
32434211,Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes.
32434254,Combined action for basic research, chemistry, pharmacognosy, virology, and clinical studies, but also supply chain, sustainable sourcing, and economic aspects have to be considered.
32434272,However, clinical research is rapidly progressing, as shown by the hundreds of registered clinical trials on candidate drugs for COVID-19.
32434272,All this makes data sharing and secondary analysis difficult.At last, small single centre studies and the use of drugs on a compassionate basis should be replaced by highly powered, multi-centre, multi-arm clinical trials, in orderto provide the required evidence of safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed candidate drugs.
32434272,Hopefully, the efforts of clinical researchers in the fight against the SARS Cov-2 will result into the identification of effective treatments.
32434272,To make this possible, clinical research should be oriented by guidelines for more harmonized high-quality studies and by a united commitment of the scientific community to share personal knowledge and data.
32434272,Allergists and clinical immunologists should have a leading role in this unprecedent challenge.
32434277,These patients do not normally present with clinical manifestations linked to COVID-19, and their PCR and serological tests are usually negative for specific IgM and IgG.
32434289,A 66-years-old man presented to the hospital and his recent travel history, infective symptoms and CXR made him a possible COVID-19 suspect.
32434310,The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical features and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and to compare the characteristics of patients diagnosed in Wuhan and in other areas of China by integrating the findings reported in previous studies.
32434310,Fever (84.8%; 95% CI, 78.5% to 90.1%) was identified as the most common clinical manifestation in all COVID-19 patients, and signs of respiratory infection were also frequently present in these patients.
32434310,When comparing the clinical features according to the location of diagnosis, fever and dyspnea were less frequent in patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan (fever: 78.1%; 95% CI, 73.2% to 82.7%; dyspnea: 3.80%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 12.22%) than in patients diagnosed in Wuhan (fever: 91.7%; 95% CI, 88.0% to 94.8%; dyspnea: 21.1%; 95% CI, 13.2% to 30.3%).
32434314,A group of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services.
32434314,We analyze all these consequences and propose some practical treatment options, based on current evidence and clinical experience, as well as several suggestions for management of rehabilitation services and patients with suspected or confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2.
32434337,The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath.
32434339,Diagnostic approaches to COVID-19 include clinical history, PCR tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and detection of antibodies.
32434339,We used a questionnaire to ascertain travel history and clinical signs of any respiratory tract infection.
32434339,The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 from Euroimmun (Germany) was used to analyse immunoglobulin levels. 17 % of the tested cohort reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 35.8 % reported history of international travel.
32434400,The risk/benefit assessment and the main infection control policies in the clinical practices are also looked at.
32434402,Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.
32434402,Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32434518,The NLR had an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.707 to 0.991) in the derivation cohort and 0.867 (95% CI 0.747 to 0.944) in the validation cohort, the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision and clinical impact curves showed that the NLR had high standardized net benefit.
32434597,Service provision is an ongoing challenge due to the increasing need for services given the increased mental health burden of COVID-19 but also the restrictions in place in clinical areas to achieve social distancing.
32434605,We present the case of a lady in her thirties with a history of well controlled contamination OCD who presented acutely with a significant exacerbation of OCD symptoms precipitated by media reports of COVID-19.
32434615,Management of the high rates of medical and psychiatric complications, including self-harm and suicide, associated with Anorexia Nervosa require regular clinical review.
32434615,However, during the current pandemic, face to face clinical assessments carry the risk of infection and transmission in this vulnerable cohort already compromised by low weight and lowered immunity.
32434632,Wuchang PFTH is the first one to put into clinical practice and the last one suspended in Wuhan.
32434633,To study the clinical and epidemiological features of children with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32434633,The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed.
32434633,All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2.
32434634,To study the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged &lt;18 years.
32434634,COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results.
32434634,Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.
32434635,Case 2 was a boy aged 13 years and 8 months and had no clinical symptoms; chest CT showed no abnormality, while the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 yielded a positive result.
32434708,A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data.
32434788,Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients.
32434788,Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported.
32434788,These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy.
32434790,One important clinical question is how to manage patients who need anticancer therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during these conditions.
32434790,In particular, we consider the impact of ICI on COVID-19 severity, decisions surrounding continuing or interrupting therapy, diagnostic measures in patients with symptoms or manifestations potentially consistent with either COVID-19 or ICI toxicity, and resumption of therapy in infected patients.
32434790,While more robust data are needed to guide clinicians on management of patients with cancer who may be affected by COVID-19, we hope this commentary provides useful insights for the clinical community.
32434798,Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with covid-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.
32434963,Epidemic impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to SARS CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) by MERS CoV has engraved their place in the scientific literature.<sup>2</sup> In general, CoV is known to cause respiratory diseases in humans and accounts for one-third of common cold infections.<sup>3</sup> The current outbreak by 2019 nCoV in the Chinese city of Wuhan began in December 2019, has infected nearly 102,188 with 3,491 deaths reported as of March 7, 2020, and has spread to nearly 92 countries.<sup>1,4</sup> An assumed incubation period between 2 and 14 days, with flu-like symptoms, may progress into severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome which may be the reason for mortality.<sup>5,6</sup>.
32435065,In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 - 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy.
32435173,This paper reports clinical recommendations and scientific studies to assist clinicians in this field.
32435268,In view of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is fundamental to stress that the behavior and hygiene rules adopted by children with cancer must be respected and implemented in order to continue to safeguard their health for the current pandemic.
32435272,Cancer patients are a special group, the immunity of them will be suppressed because of various anti-tumor treatments, and the risk of infection will be greatly increased, so we will report clinical features of 9 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 (56%) patients were ordinary type, 3 (33%) were severe type, and 1 (11%) was critical type.
32435272,From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method.
32435272,D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT(computed tomography) progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients, in our study, more 50% of patients had elevated levels of these indicators, but only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. 5 (56%) ordinary type patients had been discharged, while the 1 (11%) critical type patient died 3 days after admission.
32435867,In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes.
32435870,Therefore, healthcare providers need to be familiar with the clinical presentation of infected patients and measures to quickly isolate them.
32435879,The severity of symptoms was mild in all the patients, with little radiological involvement.
32435879,Fever and upper respiratory symptoms were the most frequent findings.
32435879,COVID-19 disease appears to have a similar clinical course in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies, even in immunosuppressed cases, as in healthy children of the same age; however, special attention must be paid to fluid management and drug dose adjustment.
32435882,These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.
32435920,The present review aims to present most of the pre-clinical and clinical evidence about lithium's ability to inhibit DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae, as well as the possible pathways and mechanisms involved in such antiviral activity.
32435920,Despite a broad number of in vitro studies, the rationale for the antiviral activity of lithium failed to translate into methodologically sound clinical studies demonstrating its antiviral efficacy.
32435920,Lithium presents a clear antiviral activity demonstrated at preclinical level, but that remains to be confirmed in clinical settings.
32435925,• CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.
32436029,Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the large numbers of hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support, clinical use of inhaled nitric oxide may become an alternate rescue therapy before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32436101,While the epidemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, more and more evidences are collected about the presence of neurological manifestations and symptoms associated with it.
32436101,Neurological manifestations, or NeuroCOVID, are part of the COVID-19 clinical picture, but questions remain regarding the frequency and severity of CNS symptoms, the mechanism of action underlying neurological symptoms, and the relationship of symptoms with the course and severity of COVID-19.
32436101,Further clinical, epidemiological, and basic science research is urgently needed to understand and address neurological sequalae of COVID-19.
32436105,The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit admission.
32436105,A retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, who developed clinical and neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32436355,The pandemic of new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has stressed the importance of effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of clinical worsening and mortality.
32436355,Epidemiological data showing a differential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on women and men has suggested a potential role for testosterone (T) in determining gender-disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes.
32436355,To estimate the association between T level and SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes (defined as conditions requiring transfer to higher or lower intensity of care or death) in a cohort of patients admitted in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 31 male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and recovered in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the &quot;Carlo Poma&quot; Hospital in Mantua were analyzed.
32436441,Based on observations described in our letter, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) anosmia must imperatively be added to the list of specific symptoms of COVID-19 infection, (2) anosmia can serve as a free and specific diagnostic tool for developing countries currently affected by the pandemic, (3) the mechanisms of COVID-19 anosmia seem not to directly involve nasal obstruction but rather seem to be related to damage the olfactory neuroepithelium.
32436445,The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
32436460,Given the similarities of clinical features and pathogenesis between toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and COVID-19, we hypothesize that the application of etanercept, an inhibitor of TNFα, could attenuate disease progression in severe group COVID-19 patients by suppressing systemic auto-inflammatory responses. <i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.</i>
32436581,There is significant evidence that osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) can alleviate pulmonary symptoms and aid in quicker recoveries from various respiratory ailments.
32436617,While it is unclear whether the patients on ISAs for skin conditions are more prone to develop COVID 19, and what impact the ISA may have on the clinical outcome if a patient does get infected, rationalizations based on the specific immune effects of each drug, and existing literature on incidence of various infections with each, are possible.
32436617,In this review, we provide the readers with practically useful insights into these aspects, related to the conventional ISAs, and briefly mention the clinical outcome data available on related scenarios from other patient groups so far.
32436948,We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who came to our attention for fever, neck pain radiated to the jaw, and palpitations occurring 15 days after a SARS-CoV-2-positive oropharyngeal swab.
32436948,Neck pain and fever recovered within 2 days and the remaining symptoms within 1 week.
32436948,We alert clinicians to additional and unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.
32436994,We extracted and analyzed individual level data on baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes.
32436994,Recent data indicate that severe COVID 19 causes cytokine release storm and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and IL-6 plays an important role.
32436994,However, to our knowledge, there is no individual patient data systematic review performed to summarize baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID 19 patients who received tocilizumab.
32436996,To study the relationship between clinical indexes and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to explore its role in predicting the severity of COVID-19.
32436996,Clinical data of 443 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital were retrospectively analyzed, which were divided into non-severe group (n=304) and severe group (n=139) according to their condition.
32436996,Clinical indicators were compared between different groups.
32436996,NLR, CRP and platelets can effectively assess the severity of COVID-19, among which NLR is the best predictor of severe COVID-19, and the combination of three clinical indicators can further predict severe COVID-19.
32437000,This case demonstrates an atypical clinical presentation of COVID - 19 in an HIV infected patient without other co-morbidity.
32437004,COVID-19 is highly contagious and has a variety of clinical manifestations, it can affect a number of other organs in addition to the lungs, and liver injury may occur.
32437004,Clinical studies have found that liver injury in COVID-19 patients mainly manifests as abnormal liver biochemical indicators, but there have been no reports of liver failure caused by this disease.
32437014,The results showed that ozone therapy may promote recovery of clinical condition and improvement of chest CT images, shorten the duration of viral shedding and length of hospital stay.
32437017,We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of all confirmed cases in Qinghai, a province at high altitude.
32437022,No significant correlations were found between the presence and severity of chemosensitive disorders and the severity of the clinical course.
32437022,On the contrary, there is a significant correlation between the duration of the olfactory and gustatory symptoms and the development of severe COVID-19.
32437022,Contrary to recent reports, such objective testing refutes the proposal that the presence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may predict a milder course, but instead suggests that those with more severe disease neglect such symptoms in the setting of severe respiratory disease.
32437033,Epidemiological and clinical data were collected.
32437033,The most common symptoms were fatigue (72.9%), headache (60.0%), nasal obstruction (58.6%), and postnasal drip (48.6%).
32437077,By examining the clinical data available in the public domain, the present work clarifies the clinical presentations in children with COVID-19 in China.
32437077,SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared similar clinical features.
32437077,Similar to SARS, younger children had a less aggressive clinical course, compared with adolescents.
32437077,While fewer symptoms were observed in children compared to adults, there is not yet sufficient evidence to conclude shorter hospital stay in children.
32437181,Finally, clinical and research implications are discussed.
32437232,In many clinical settings, this requires tools that can be broadly used to identify pathology and risks.
32437242,The questions covered items on patients, healthcare workers, risk reduction measure and clinical trials. <b>Results:</b> A total of 12 centers involving 861 healthcare members joined the survey.
32437242,The measures applied to patients and health workers partially converged in all the departments while major divergences were found in the clinical trials domain.
32437338,The couple (the index cases) attended church-related events during March 6-8, and developed nonspecific respiratory symptoms and fever on March 10 (wife) and 11 (husband).
32437338,Before his symptoms had developed, the husband attended a Bible study group on March 11.
32437432,Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19.
32437513,In this review, we focus on the genomic, transmission and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for SARS-CoV-2.
32437513,SARS-CoV-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects, including the design of primers, the selection of specimens and testing strategies at different disease stages.
32437547,To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community.
32437547,SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days.
32437575,However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited.
32437575,To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures.
32437575,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records.
32437575,A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population.
32437575,The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs.
32437575,The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]).
32437576,To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms.
32437576,Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32437576,Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19.
32437576,Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested.
32437576,Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms.
32437576,Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread.
32437576,The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.
32437586,This hyper-responsiveness has been suggested to be the predominant aetiology for clinical deterioration and mortality in patients with this infection [2].
32437596,The universality and clinical implications of our observations require further research to define.
32437665,The aim of the present study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China.
32437665,The internationally recommended EPDS was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.
32437665,Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of COVID-19 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=0.02) than women assess pre-epidemic announcement.
32437665,Pregnant women who were underweight pre-pregnancy, primiparous, &lt; 35 years old, employed full-time, middle income, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk to develop depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.
32437679,Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment.
32437679,The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5-36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7-40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6-44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2-42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5-50·5] of 129).
32437696,To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals.
32437696,Whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms remains unknown.
32437696,We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9th to March 5th, 2020.
32437696,Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes.
32437696,The outcome was recovery and hospital discharge in 86% of patients, while 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital.
32437696,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%), while 5.2% showed no obvious symptoms.
32437696,Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, and provide an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32437706,On day 11, his respiratory symptoms worsened.
32437740,Immunologic dysfunction due to COVID-19 is closely related to clinical prognosis, and the inflammatory response of pregnant women may affect the directional differentiation and function of fetal immune cells.
32437740,Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we also recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns.
32437740,One (1.96%) infant with an extremely elevated IL-6 concentration developed necrotizing enterocolitis in the third week after birth, and the remaining 50 infants did not show abnormal symptoms through the end of the follow-up period.
32437770,In this retrospective observational single-center study we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of all MHD patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 12<sup>th</sup> to April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020 as confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction.
32437770,Baseline features, clinical course, laboratory data, and different therapies were compared between survivors and non-survivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality.
32437770,Clinical and radiological evolution during the first week of admission were predictive of mortality.
32437770,Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as defined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 Liters/minute and radiological worsening.
32437770,However, a longer time on hemodialysis (hazard ratio 1.008(95% confidence interval 1.001-1.015) per year), increased LDH levels (1.006(1.001-1.011), and lower lymphocyte count (0.996 (0.992-1.000) one week after clinical onset were all significantly associated with higher mortality risk.
32437797,This virus associated symptoms and infectious respiratory illness is designated as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
32437797,In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity.
32437830,Here we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormality.
32437830,We received 156 patients diagnosed of COVID-19 from two designated centers in China, and compared clinical features between patients with elevated aminotransferase or not.
32437877,The abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients are not always like those of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can change over time.
32437915,A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively.
32437930,We considered outbreak information where the first case registered in Marche with onset symptoms (26 February 2020) to the present date (20 April 2020).
32437932,To report a clinical case of a patient with a compatible HRCT scan and two negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA upper respiratory tract specimens but with a confirmed viral infection by BAL (19 days after symptom onset).
32437932,Revision of a patient's clinical charts with COVID-19 admitted at INMI L.
32437932,Spallanzani Hospital RESULTS: Two oropharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were performed at admission (17 days from symptoms onset) and a day apart and were found negative.
32437932,BAL fluid collected 19 days after symptoms onset was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32437932,This case highlights importance of clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in diagnosis and infectivity assessment.
32437933,Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs).
32437935,To describe the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32437936,Cutaneous manifestation is a newly reported clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection.
32437936,The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described.
32437942,Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision-making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers).
32437944,Survival data were supplemented by descriptions of best- and worst-case clinical scenarios.
32438005,Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility.
32438005,Despite not being a COVID-19 center, we consider all patients at the neurosurgical ward and staff members as asymptomatic carriers or infected in the preclinical period.
32438330,This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there is utmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy.
32438330,Hence, randomised clinical trials are recommended at the earliest to save the lives of infected individuals of COVID-19.
32438331,Clinical evidence exists that patients with diabetes are at higher risk for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32438331,We investigated the physiological origins of this clinical observation linking diabetes with severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19.
32438331,A deep network analysis has suggested clinical biomarkers predicting the higher risk: Hypertension, elevated serum Alanine aminotransferase, high Interleukin-6, and low Lymphocytes count.
32438331,The revealed biomarkers can be applied directly in clinical practice.
32438333,Studies published between December-2019 and March-2020 reporting demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases were identified.
32438340,Antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced neutropenia may favour the progression of COVID-19 and symptoms of infection may be confused with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32438425,Beginning March 22, 2020, all pregnant women from one large obstetrical practice in New York City were contacted regularly to inquire about symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, anosmia), or sick contacts.
32438425,For this report, we included every patient with suspected COVID-19 infection, which was defined as at least two symptoms, or a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test.
32438425,One woman had an unexplained fetal demise at 14 weeks' gestation around the time of her COVID-19 symptoms.
32438446,This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity.
32438446,Future studies should focus on EC<sub>90</sub> values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.
32438448,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) doctors were redeployed to unfamiliar clinical teams, where they would work at the level of a fully-registered Foundation doctor.
32438448,As undergraduate clinical teaching fellows, we were re-purposed to rapidly produce a training programme to refresh the medical knowledge of doctors who were from a wide variety of non-medical specialities and grades.
32438448,Building on our experience of facilitating medical students, wedevised medical ward-based scenarios in an informal Objective Structure Clinical Examination (OSCE) style to promote focused active learning and prompt further independent study.
32438450,Immunomodulatory drugs are hypothesised to abrogate the dysfunctional immune response in hyperinflammatory COVID-19 and are currently being investigated in clinical trials.
32438450,IL-1 blockage with anakinra has been shown to be safe and is associated with clinical improvement in patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (Cavalli, et al 2020).
32438453,The University of British Columbia (UBC) Faculty of Medicine suspended clinical rotations for medical students on March 14, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32438459,Among these treatments, the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic derivate of chloroquine, has become a common practice among clinicians, including pediatricians, despite lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy for this indication (especially for pediatric patients) at present time (2).
32438527,The clinical situation is complex, with children presenting different clinical features compared to adults.
32438579,This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of different types of family infections with COVID-19 and to share Taiwan's experience.
32438622,Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
32438677,IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms.
32438687,Extreme caution should be taken with diabetics with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
32438703,(6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur.
32438703,(8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.
32438806,The clinical performance of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 181 clinical samples.
32438806,Compared to the qRT-PCR kit, OSN-qRT-PCR assay revealed higher sensitivity and specificity hence better suited to clinical applications for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral load.
32438868,Quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.
32438868,We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from 77 clinical throat swabs, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey.
32438868,Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.
32438876,From 10 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, we continuously observed chest CT imaging of 14 patients with clinically suspected new coronavirus infection in the two weeks after onset of symptoms.
32438878,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major clinical as well as organisational impact on the national health-care system in Italy, particularly in high-volume hospitals which are usually active for many essential clinical needs, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
32438878,Here, we report major clinical and organisational challenges at a high-volume Italian IBD centre one month after the start of the Italian government's restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32438878,Everyone attending the centre (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrative personnel and patients) were advised to respect the general recommended rules for hand hygiene and social distancing, to disclose if they had a fever or cough or flu-like symptoms and to wear a surgical mask and gloves.
32438878,At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning.
32438878,At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in 'quarantine' for contact considered to be 'at risk' for the infection.
32438878,Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms.
32438895,We recorded all stroke admissions, and the adequacy of acute care measures, including the number of thrombectomies, workflow metrics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes.
32438941,The Central Clinical Committee analyzed that these re-positive cases after the COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the 'dead virus' remaining in the cured patients' body is amplified during the test process.
32438945,This study highlights the need at our clinical site for interventions to address the issues identified by staff.
32439197,Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients.
32439209,Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing.
32439237,Telemedicine can help in the triage of patients to screen for symptoms of COVID-19 before their regular appointment.
32439306,Although some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well controlled clinical trials.
32439389,To describe maternal disease and obstetrical outcomes associated with Covid-19 disease in pregnancy to rapidly inform clinical care.
32439389,Symptoms resolved in a median of 24 days (interquartile range 13-37).
32439651,Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients.
32439651,Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.
32439716,The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes.The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit.
32439716,The public health tools and schemes for priority setting in oncology have been used as models, aspiring to capture clinical urgency, value in healthcare, community goals and fairness, while respecting the principles of benevolence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice.We discuss the priority health interventions across the cancer continuum, giving a perspective on the role and meaning to maintain some services (undeferrable) while temporarily abrogate some others (deferrable).
32439716,Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine.The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.
32439731,Patients are presenting at emergency departments with symptoms of dyspnoea, dry cough and fever with varying severity.
32439731,This is assisted through clinical assessment and various imaging and laboratory investigations, including chest X-ray, blood analysis and identification of viral infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32439821,Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital &quot;12 de Octubre,&quot; Madrid, Spain.
32439821,Further investigation is required to clarify the full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms and its optimal treatment.
32440387,We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.
32440660,Results revealed that low-grade fever and cough were the principal symptoms in all patients.
32440660,Available data showed that pregnant patients in late pregnancy had clinical manifestations similar to non-pregnant adults.
32440661,Thus, it is necessary to clearly characterize clinical manifestations and management of COVID-19 infection in children to provide accurate information for healthcare workers.
32440661,Accordingly, the present study was designed to review articles published on clinical manifestations and characteristics of children and infants with COVID-19.
32440661,Clinical manifestation in children may be mild (72%), moderate (22%) or severe (6%), and the most common symptoms include dry cough (91%) and fever (96%).
32440661,Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared to infected adults.
32440663,Although the findings of some studies have been indicative of the direct relationship between the severity of clinical findings and imaging, reports have been published regarding inconsistency of clinical findings with imaging and laboratory evidence.
32440663,This letter aimed to draw attention to the role of pulmonary thromboembolism as a potential and possible cause of clinical deterioration in covid-19 patients.
32440666,The relationship of GGO score with age, sex, and symptoms at presentation was investigated.
32440692,However, how SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological or GI symptoms is not clear.
32440692,Many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations, caused by viral invasion, as the most likely reason for the GI and neurological symptoms; however, the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without neurological or GI symptoms indicate that this is not the case.
32440692,The gut-brain axis could explain the reason for why some with COVID-19 do not have these symptoms.
32440692,The temporal correlation between neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests the lymph vessels around the GI tract, the vascular system, or the gut-brain axis (enteric nervous system) as the most likely entry route for SARS-CoV-2 to the brain.
32440724,HCW were mostly physicians (74%), from high-prevalence regions (52%). 25% experienced typical symptoms during the last 14 days prior to survey completion, with only 45% of them being tested for COVID-19.
32440857,The clinical characteristics and disease course in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis has not been described so far.
32440887,The European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) launched the EPICENTRE (ESPNIC Covid pEdiatric Neonatal Registry) international, multicenter, and multidisciplinary initiative to study the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32440887,EPICENTRE is open to centers all over the world, and this will allow to provide a pragmatic picture of the epidemic, with a particular attention to pediatric and neonatal critical care issues.Conclusions: EPICENTRE will allow researchers to clarify the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and outcomes of pediatric and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, refining its clinical management and hopefully providing new insights for clinicians.What is Known:• COVID19 is the new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is spreading around the globe.
32440906,Pulmonary complications are the most common clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32440906,From recent clinical observation, two phenotypes have emerged: a low elastance or L-type and a high elastance or H-type.
32440906,Clinical presentation, pathophysiology, pulmonary mechanics, radiological and ultrasound findings of these two phenotypes are different.
32441229,With little warning, clinical rotations were cancelled and medical students were sent home.
32441229,While pre-clinical students transitioned to online curricula, clinical students were left without discreet educational goals.
32441243,Both infections can manifest as digestive symptoms and merit screening when assessing patients with diarrhea during the coronavirus disease pandemic.
32441299,Due to the lack of efficient therapeutic options and clinical trial limitations, the FDA approved drugs can be a good choice to handle Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32441330,The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life.
32441330,We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline.
32441330,We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life.
32441330,The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life.
32441330,We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression.
32441330,Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale.
32441330,The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants).
32441330,The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain.
32441332,The aim of this study is to report our clinical experience in the management of pregnant women infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first thirty days of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
32441332,We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from March 14<sup>th</sup> to April 14<sup>th</sup> , 2020.
32441332,Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected.
32441332,The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5%, each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%).
32441332,Most of the pregnant COVID-19 positive patients had a favorable clinical course.
32441332,However, one-third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status.
32441462,There is an opportunity, but more importantly, an obligation for the global clinical and quantitative pharmacology community to come together and use our state-of-the-art tools and expertise to help society accelerate therapeutics to fight COVID-19.
32441548,Social education about early recognition of symptoms of life-threatening cardiac conditions requiring appropriate care in a timely fashion may help to reduce this counter-productive phenomenon.
32441574,Since its outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province China, 2019-coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) had been widely spread all over the world, the control of which calls for a better understanding of its epidemiology and clinical characteristics.
32441574,We included 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University from 23 January 2020 to 11 February 2020, which were retrospectively analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features.
32441574,Clinical manifestations included fever (12/12), fatigue (10/12), cough (6/12), sore throat (4/12), headache (3/12), and diarrhea (2/12).
32441666,In the study, we aimed to dissect the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological findings in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32441680,The COVID-19 pandemic has required us to recognize a new normal and other additions to our general and clinical vocabulary.
32441744,Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes.
32441744,Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings.
32441744,Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance.
32441753,This report describes the clinical and virological characteristics of three children in a family cluster experiencing infection with SARS-CoV2.
32441753,The children were only briefly symptomatic with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms.
32441764,PARPi's can effectively decrease IL-6, IL-1 and TNFα levels (key interleukins in SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials.
32441773,The worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised many challenges and uncertainties regarding disease management and prognosis in immunocompromised patient populations.
32441773,Previous reports suggest the possibility of a protective factor from standard antiretroviral treatment for HIV patients that could have significant clinical benefits for these patients when co-infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32441773,HIV patients also generally present with atypical clinical presentation and have a less severe form of COVID-19 than the general population.
32441786,In most cases, application of methylprednisolone in severe and critical viral pneumonia patients can quickly alleviate the symptoms of dyspnea and prevent disease progression.
32441786,By comparing the clinical data we concluded that corticosteroids therapy can effectively release COVID-19 symptoms such as persistent fever and difficult breathing, improve oxygenation and prevent disease progression.
32441787,Here, a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was reported, whose laboratory data, clinical treatment and hospital outcome was described in this study.
32441788,Many critically ill patients with COVID-19 need specialty level palliative care to manage symptoms, conduct goals of care conversations, and facilitate medical decision making in ethically and emotionally charged situations.
32441935,In this study, we established two RT-RAA assays for the S and orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 using clinical specimens for validation.
32442030,Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020.
32442035,Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus.
32442082,Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known.
32442082,However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients.
32442082,Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2].
32442082,Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19.
32442082,Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6].
32442082,However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research.
32442082,It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10].
32442082,Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies.
32442210,The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
32442210,Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32442256,Infectivity of patients with Ct &gt;24 and duration of symptoms &gt;8 days may be low.
32442256,This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions.
32442265,Here, we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32442285,We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
32442285,Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers.
32442287,However, clinical benefits and mechanism of Tα1 supplement to COVID-19 are still unclear.
32442287,We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe cases with COVID-19 admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020.
32442308,To investigate clinical outcomes, distribution of quarantine locations, and the infection status of the contacts of COVID-19 patients after discharge.
32442308,Demographics, baseline characteristics of 131 COVID-19 patients discharged from February 3 to 21, 2020 in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed by reviewing the medical records retrospectively.
32442308,Post-hospitalization data related to clinical outcomes, quarantine locations and close contact history were obtained by following up the patients every week up to 4 weeks.
32442308,These symptoms constantly declined in 4 weeks post discharge.
32442308,Although no contacted infection observed, appropriate self-quarantine and regular reexamination are necessary, particularly for those who have recurred symptoms.
32442333,Although the risk is low, with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 and the appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and a high fatality rate, appropriate measures should be taken by health departments to ensure the safety of clinical blood.
32442437,The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting.
32442437,Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours.
32442437,According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.
32442528,Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.
32442528,We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.
32442528,Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.
32442528,The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.
32442528,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.
32442562,Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms.
32442684,In many places struck by the epidemic, clinical branches have prepared new guidelines for approaching the management of the disease in their area during the pandemic.
32442699,Of the 18 patients, 50.0% (n=9) experienced de novo psoriasis, 27.8% (n=5) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms and 22.2% (n=4) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration.
32442699,Monitoring for adverse effects of HCQ treatment is necessary, and clinical trials are essential in characterizing the safety profile of HCQ use in patients with a COVID-19 infection.
32442756,In addition, 220 clinical and laboratory observations/records were also collected.
32442756,Clinical indicators were associated with severe/critical symptoms were identified and a model for severe/critical symptom prediction was developed.
32442756,Totally, 36 clinical indicators significantly associated with severe/critical symptom were identified.
32442756,The clinical indicators are mainly thyroxine, immune related cells and products.
32442756,Cox multivariate regression and survival analyses revealed that the model significantly discriminated the severe/critical cases and used the information of the selected clinical indicators.
32442932,The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and course of illness of patients infected with Covid-19 that were hospitalized in a private clinical setting during March 2020.
32442932,We recorded data about epidemiological characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, in addition to comorbidities, laboratory and radiological studies were done.
32442932,Larger population studies are required in order to confirm these clinical findings.
32443023,Pediatric patients present a unique challenge as they may have minimal symptoms and yet transmit disease.
32443163,Furthermore, the data obtained with high-dosed native interferon beta in life-threatening acute viral diseases as well as the results of clinical pilot studies with high-dosed recombinant interferon beta-1a are provided because they serve as the rationale for the proposed therapeutic regimen to be applied in acute viral infections.
32443442,Here we evaluate clinical and imaging parameters for estimating the need of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment.
32443442,We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
32443459,We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.
32443712,A higher percentage of participants knew about &quot;Clinical and pathogen characteristics of COVID-19&quot;, compared to &quot;Regulations and policies related to COVID-19&quot;.
32443899,We described features of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and identified predictors of clinical deterioration.
32443899,We included patients consecutively admitted at Humanitas Research Hospital (Rozzano, Milan, Italy); retrospectively extracted demographic; clinical; laboratory and imaging findings at admission; used survival methods to identify factors associated with clinical deterioration (defined as intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death), and developed a prognostic index.
32443899,Clinical deterioration occurred in 70 patients (29.3%), including 41 (17.2%) ICU transfers and 36 (15.1%) deaths.
32443899,The most common symptoms and signs at admission were cough (77.8%) and elevated respiratory rate (34.1%), while 66.5% of patients had at least one coexisting medical condition.
32443899,Age; increased respiratory rate; abnormal blood gas parameters and imaging findings; coexisting coronary heart disease; leukocytosis; lymphocytopenia; and several laboratory parameters (elevated procalcitonin; interleukin-6; serum ferritin; C-reactive protein; aspartate aminotransferase; lactate dehydrogenase; creatinine; fibrinogen; troponin-I; and D-dimer) were significant predictors of clinical deterioration.
32444169,The most common symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, and fever.
32444358,Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington).
32444366,To describe outcomes of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with severity of illness.
32444382,Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials.
32444382,While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group.
32444382,To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug.
32444382,Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers.
32444382,Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect <i>in vivo</i> virus titers.
32444382,Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems.
32444382,While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi.
32444382,As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.
32444393,Our study aimed to investigate the clinical features of patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
32444393,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed.
32444393,In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]).
32444393,The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, including fever and cough, were less common in patients on hemodialysis.
32444412,Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.
32444415,The clinical features of rheumatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been reported.
32444415,This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients and provide information for handling this situation in clinical practice.
32444415,Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020.
32444415,Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively.
32444415,There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash.
32444460,To characterise the clinical features of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United Kingdom during the growth phase of the first wave of this outbreak who were enrolled in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, and to explore risk factors associated with mortality in hospital.
32444460,A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data.
32444460,The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8).
32444482,In March 2020, we searched international and Chinese biomedical literature databases, clinical trial registries and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies comparing patients receiving and not receiving convalescent plasma.
32444493,To report clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurologic diseases with and without COVID-19.
32444493,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period.
32444504,Though it is hoped that the actual acute phase of COVID-19 infection will be short lived, it is vital that important clinical research is continued, given the long-term benefits of ongoing clinical research for patients with long-term conditions, including CVD.
32444569,Rooming in of infected mothers and neonates, provided their good clinical conditions, is not contraindicated based on current knowledge.
32444743,There is potential for a determined revision of the current activity-driven clinical approach, with the adoption of the minimally invasive oral care philosophy into routine practice and use of technology to remotely support our patients.
32444743,These vital traits and bold clinical leadership, prepared to make timely choices and act fast, will underpin our successful transition towards the safe resumption of routine dental services.
32444797,Biobanks can be either integrated into healthcare, where preservation of the biological material is a fork in clinical routine diagnostics and medical treatment processes or they can also host prospective cohorts or material related to clinical trials.
32444866,The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances.
32444866,For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.
32444880,An understanding of the risk factors and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may provide guidance for management.
32444880,Most (63%) had symptoms for 5 days or longer prior to admission.
32444942,We describe the clinical course of 4 patients with Down syndrome during an outbreak of COVID-19.
32444993,Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors.
32445030,All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included.
32445030,Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.
32445105,Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent.
32445105,Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee.
32445105,Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate.
32445134,A review of the literature revealed that the results of some studies suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is possible to isolate the virus from the conjunctival sac of these patients.
32445165,Although COVID-19 lacks specific signs and symptoms, we believe internists should develop specific skills to recognize the disease, learning its 'semeiotic'.
32445165,In this review article, we summarize the key clinical features that may guide in differentiating a COVID-19 case, requiring specific testing, from upper respiratory and/or influenza-like illnesses of other aetiology.
32445165,We consider two different clinical settings, where availability of the different diagnostic strategies differs widely: outpatient and inpatient.
32445165,Our reasoning highlights how challenging a balanced approach to a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms can be.
32445165,At present, clinical workup of COVID-19 remains a hard task to accomplish.
32445165,However, knowledge of the natural history of the disease may aid the internist in putting common and unspecific symptoms into the correct clinical context.
32445195,COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical care and research in the United States.
32445195,Additionally, the pandemic has impacted ALS clinical trials by impairing the ability to obtain measurements for trial eligibility, to monitor safety and efficacy outcomes, and to dispense study drug since these also often rely on in-person visits.
32445249,We review recent coronavirus-related epidemics and distinguish clinical and molecular features of CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, and review the current status of vaccine trials.
32445484,Several drugs are being repurposed into clinical trials in COVID-19 patients, ranging from drugs already well established in other diseases, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ ritonavir, azithromycin and tocilizumab/sarilumab, to those such as remdesivir still in development for their initial indication (1).
32445484,The opportunities for clinical pharmacology to contribute to the development of new treatments have already been described by others in Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics (2).
32445579,Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020.
32445580,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described.
32445580,Laboratory data, demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records.
32445581,Notably, the flux between clinical decisions based on best interests towards decisions explicitly based on resource considerations should be underpinned by an authoritative public policy decision to preserve legitimacy and lawfulness.
32445583,All patients had an excellent outcome, and had minimal or no systemic symptoms.
32445710,However, in settings where the outbreak continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms).
32445839,As the number of cases increased the demand for tests multiplied, leading the CDC to utilize the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus.
32445839,As SARS-CoV-2 virus arrived in the USA causing the COVID-19 illness, one of the most talked about issues in the management of the disease and the resulting pandemic has been clinical testing.
32445839,In addition, multiple other tests were put in place under a separate authorization by a Presidential memorandum in early March allowing laboratories that carry Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification to put tests in place without an EUA from the FDA.
32445881,Of 141 COVID-19 patients, baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between combined group and monotherapy group, that 30% of the patients leucocytes counts were below the normal range and 36.4% of the patients experienced lymphocytopenia.
32445935,Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4,5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19.
32445956,In China, interventional therapies with traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 have achieved significant clinical efficacies, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear.
32445956,This article reviewed the etiology of COVID-19 and clinical efficacy.
32446167,A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with clinical outcomes.
32446287,Remdesivir (formerly GS-5734) is a nucleoside analogue pro-drug currently being evaluated in COVID-19 clinical trials.
32446287,In pre-clinical models, remdesivir has demonstrated potent antiviral activity against diverse human and zoonotic β-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
32446287,In this article we critically review available data on remdesivir with an emphasis on biochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and in vitro activity against coronaviruses as well as clinical experience and current progress in COVID-19 clinical trials.
32446305,The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever.
32446305,There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TB-HIV, and this will require unpicking.
32446312,The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed.
32446312,There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission.
32446594,Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies.
32446652,COVID-19 could cause a wide range of symptoms ranging from self-limiting fever, sore throat, and cough to more severe symptoms that could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32446778,There are still many unresolved questions regarding the pathogenesis of this disease and especially the reasons underlying the extremely different clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe manifestations, including the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
32446778,SARS-CoV-2 showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, and some of the clinical features are shared between COVID-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections.
32446778,Basic and clinical evidences obtained from previous SARS and MERS epidemics and available data from COVID-19 will be taken into account.
32446795,Diabetes is an established risk associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with COVID-19 has not been reported yet.
32446795,The clinical features, treatment strategies and prognosis data were collected and analyzed.
32446795,Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%).
32446813,However, currently, drugs specifically approved for clinical use are not available, except for vaccines against COVID-19 that are being evaluated.
32446813,Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is capable of performing syndrome differentiation and treatment according to the clinical manifestations of patients, and has a better ability of epidemic prevention and control.
32446978,The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020).
32447060,In 2020 both door-to-balloon and symptoms-to-PCI were longer and admission levels of hs-cTnI were higher.
32447102,These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.
32447193,Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and particularly data of all neurological symptoms were extracted from the imaging reports.
32447256,We sought to evaluate the prevalence and etiology of all community acquired viral respiratory infections requiring hospitalization during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on co-infection rates and clinical outcomes.
32447256,Over a 10-week period, all admissions to our institution, the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore, were screened for respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 as well as a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens were systematically tested for.
32447256,Information was collated on clinical outcomes, including requirement for mechanical ventilation and in hospital mortality.
32447256,One-fifth (19.3%, 736/3807) of hospitalized inpatients with respiratory symptoms had a PCR-proven viral respiratory infection; of which 58.5% (431/736) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 42.2% (311/736) tested positive for other common respiratory viruses.
32447274,Studies in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology, but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefit, cost-effectiveness and user satisfaction.
32447274,Incorporation of such services in routine clinical MS practice is expected to improve access to specialized care facilities for affected subjects.
32447328,This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation.
32447328,Methods A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG.
32447328,Results The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided &quot;real world&quot; analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit.
32447328,The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.
32447373,In an effort to curb the spread of the epidemic, the government has requisitioned a variety of venues and plant buildings and built more than 20 cabin hospitals to receive patients with mild symptoms within 48 hours.
32447429,The purpose of this review is to quantify the landscape of current clinical trials ongoing for therapies in the treatment of COVID-19.
32447429,A systematic search of clinicaltrials.gov was undertaken on April 22, 2020, to identify all currently registered clinical trials investigating potential therapies for patients with COVID-19.
32447429,Public interest in hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was plotted against the cumulative number of active clinical trials evaluating antimalarials as potential COVID-19 therapies over time.
32447429,There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies.
32447429,Moving forward, a concerted effort focused on implementing large, well-coordinated and carefully designed multi-armed clinical trials will help to ensure that the most promising therapeutic options are rigorously studied and clinically meaningful results produced.
32447629,Concern about the appropriate role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 speculate that NSAIDs, in particular ibuprofen, may upregulate the entry point for the virus, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors and increase susceptibility to the virus or worsen symptoms in existing disease.
32447721,In order to enhance scientific information interflow in the arena of liver diseases in Asia-Pacific region during this difficult time, Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) has taken the initiative to form the APASL COVID-19 Taskforce to formulate a clinical practice guidance in Hepatology, liver-related oncology, transplantation and conduct of clinical trials.
32447721,Based on scientific data and experiences, recommendations were made in the management of liver injury, liver transplantation, autoimmune diseases, chronic liver diseases, delivery of elective and emergency services and conduct of clinical trials.
32447721,This is the first consensus clinical guidance synthesized by APASL for our hepatologist and their allied medical personal.
32447742,The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea.
32447742,However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms.
32447742,It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32447742,Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32447742,Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32447746,Such central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms linked to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is often life threatening.
32447746,Health care providers currently evaluating patients with neurologic symptoms need consider COVID-19 in any differential diagnosis.
32447746,These considerations will facilitate prompt testing, isolation and prevention of viral transmission speeding best clinical outcomes.
32447801,We are here by suggesting that the clinical presentation of HZ at the time of the current pandemic even in patients giving mild or no suggestive history of upper respiratory symptoms should be considered as an alarming sign for a recent subclinical SARS CoV2 infection.
32447846,Eventually, the clinical therapeutic effect may be improved, the national resources be economized on and the COVID-19 epidemic be conquered early.
32447904,<b>Objective:</b> To estimate the infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 under different exposure conditions. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective study was used to conduct continuous quarantine medical observations of close contacts of people infected with COVID-19, collect epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and laboratory test data to estimate the infection rate of close contacts under different exposures. <b>Results:</b> The epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Ningbo showed persistent human-to-human characteristics.
32447934,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and coagulation characteristics in patients with critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and acro-ischemia. <b>Methods:</b> The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020.
32447934,The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men.
32447934,Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms.
32447934,Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administrated in 6 patients, which reduced D-dimer and FDP rather than improved clinical symptoms.
32447934,The timing and protocol of anticoagulation therapy are still under investigation based on more clinical data. <b>目的：</b> 总结合并肢端缺血的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者的临床和凝血功能特征。
32448041,We present several clinical studies related to the topic as well as a brief review of the potential pathophysiology of secondary infections that could present with Covid-19.
32448084,In our recent study, we explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for clinical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection compared with qRT-PCR using the same primer/probe sets issued by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) targeting viral ORF1ab or N gene, which showed that ddPCR could largely minimize the false negatives reports resulted by qRT-PCR [1].
32448084,Here, we further stringently compared the performance of qRT-PCR and ddPCR for 8 primer/probe sets with the same clinical samples and conditions.
32448085,Overall, it is highlighted an important strategy, some key residues, and chemical groups which may be considered on clinical trials for COVID-19 outbreak.
32448333,The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations.
32448345,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death.
32448345,There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections.
32448345,Adults (≥ 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenously administered remdesivir or placebo for 10 days.
32448345,The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital.
32448405,The most commonly presenting symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and fever.
32448490,This newly identified corona virus infection represents flu-like symptoms, but usually the first symptoms are fever and dry cough.
32448490,In the present article, we made an attempt to review the behavior of the virus around the world, epidemiology, a pathway for influx into the host cells, clinical presentation, as well as the treatments currently in use and future approaches; nitazoxanide may be our dream drug.
32448757,Consequently, diagnostic cardiovascular evaluations such as echocardiography are a crucial part of the disease management.
32448770,In this open-label prospective study we describe clinical characteristics and outcome of 51 patients hospitalized with confirmed and severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab intravenously.
32448770,Clinical outcomes, oxygen support, laboratory data and adverse events were collected over a follow-up of 30 days.
32448770,Over a median follow-up time of 34 days from tocilizumab, 34 patients (67%) showed an improvement in their clinical severity class; 31 were discharged; 17 (33%) showed a worsening of their clinical status, of these 14 died (27%).
32448770,Tocilizumab exerts a rapidly beneficial effect on fever and inflammatory markers, although no significant impact on the clinical outcome can be inferred by our results.
32448805,Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people.
32448818,These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations.
32449021,Among 175 household contacts not tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 67 (38.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 compatible symptoms, 39 (22.3%) had loss of smell or taste with 7 (4.0%) having loss of smell or taste in the absence of other symptoms.
32449022,A questionnaire-based evaluation of symptoms was performed after 15 days in both groups.
32449022,It appears that the number of patients treated with acetic acid (group 2) that experienced improvement in individual symptoms was double that of the other group of patients (group 1), although numbers are too small for robust statistical analysis.
32449034,However, since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool specimens much more attention has been paid to gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea.
32449043,In this study, the changes in clinical practice occurred in an orthopaedic center in Milan are described.
32449057,Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients' with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology.
32449057,The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease.
32449057,The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.
32449099,Patients presenting to the ED between March 12 and March 28, 2020, with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 and subsequent CXR and/or CT exam were selected.
32449100,Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure.
32449100,Patients were excluded if COVID-19 infection was suspected at the time of presentation, was the reason for imaging, or if any lower respiratory symptoms were present.
32449100,At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms.
32449100,Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation.
32449100,Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases.
32449100,The prevalence of disease in the population may be underestimated by the current paradigm of RT-PCR testing with the current clinical criteria of lower respiratory symptoms and exposure risk.
32449128,We reviewed 1069 medical records of all cancer patients admitted at Oncology department between Feb 1 and April 7, 2020.
32449128,We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors.
32449178,A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational age, household income, education and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms (Wilks' λ=0.68, F<sub>6,1400</sub> =108.50, p &lt; 0.001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.32).
32449178,According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES=0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES=0.22 and 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES=0.19), negative affectivity (ES = 0.96) and less positive affectivity (ES=0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort.
32449178,Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms [OR=1.94, χ2(1)=10.05, p=.002].
32449178,Multiple regression analyses indicated that COVID-19 pregnant women having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.
32449178,Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms.
32449178,Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.
32449187,Clinical nurses were conveniently recruited by an online link in three provinces out of Hubei, including Hunan (Central south), Chongqing (Southwest) and Xinjiang (Northwest) during 4-10 February 2020.
32449224,Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID-19.
32449224,The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized.
32449224,Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes.
32449235,Although immunosuppressed patients may be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection with atypical presentation, long-term immunosuppression therapy may provide some sort of protection for severe clinical complications of COVID-19.
32449329,Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can unknowingly spread the virus to several people during the early subclinical period.
32449523,We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system.
32449528,The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been poorly characterized so far.
32449528,Changes in clinical features in the period January-April 2020 were compared with those of 36 PD control subjects, matched for sex, age, and disease-duration, using the clinical impression of severity index for PD, the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale parts II and IV, and the non-motor symptoms scale.
32449528,Motor and nonmotor symptoms significantly worsened in the COVID-19 group, requiring therapy adjustment in one-third of cases.
32449528,Clinical deterioration was explained by both infection-related mechanisms and impaired pharmacokinetics of dopaminergic therapy.
32449614,The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32449663,This article interprets 3 works of art in light of Roch's story of illness and recovery and applies key insights of ethical, artistic, and clinical relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32449757,Caring for older patients with breast cancer presents unique clinical considerations due to preexisting and competing comorbidity, the potential for treatment-related toxicity, and the consequent impact on functional status.
32449766,After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms.
32449766,We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms.
32449766,As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms.
32449766,Informatics tools such as NLP and AI methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response.
32449770,Analysis found significantly greater odds of reporting symptoms of common mental health disorders (CMD), 2.49 (2.03-3.06), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 2.99 (2.11-4.24), poorer global health 2.09 (1.62-2.70) and emotional problems 1.69 (1.38-2.06) when individuals reported working with inadequate equipment.
32449770,An individual's perception of having inadequate equipment is significantly associated with symptoms of CMD, probable PTSD, poorer global health and increased reporting of emotional problems.
32449781,This internet survey study investigated the prevalence, intensity and clinical characteristics of itch related to the use of face masks by the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32449782,To determine long-term clinical outcomes in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections after hospitalization or intensive care unit admission.
32449782,Original studies reporting clinical outcomes of adult SARS and MERS survivors 3 months after admission or 2 months after discharge were included.
32449791,We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after five weeks of lockdown in Spain.
32449791,The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D were used to evaluate the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life of patients and caregivers.
32449791,The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms affected were apathy (4.15 (3.78) vs 5.75 (4.02); p=0.002) and anxiety (3.95 (3.73) vs 5.30 (4.01); p=0.006) in MCI patients and apathy (2.35 (2.70) vs 3.75 (3.78); p=0.036), agitation (0.45 (1.14) vs 1.50 (2.66); p=0.029) and aberrant motor behaviour (1.25 (2.86) vs 2.00 (2.93); p=0.044) in AD patients.
32449791,We have demonstrated the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5 weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.
32449792,In this brief report we describe, our first single-centre experience from a 58-year-old Caucasian male patient with HIV who developed a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, including clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.
32449851,Growing concerns for the safety of health care workers was raised when up to 80% of people with COVID-19 showed mild or no symptoms at all.
32449972,In this study, we described the clinical characteristics of patients with coinfection.
32449972,Common symptoms at the onset of illness included fever (six [100%] patients); five (83.3%) patients had a cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
32449972,The other symptoms were myalgia (66.6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (33.3%-50%), and altered mental status (16.7%).
32450087,We have therefore explored ACE2 receptor mRNA expression, and co-factors for Sars-CoV-2 infectivity (TMPRSS2 and furin) in bronchial brushes and biopsies from people with asthma and healthy controls, and looked for relationships between asthma severity, Th2- and IL-17 dependent gene signatures, and clinical demographics (age, sex).
32450165,Coronaviruses are associated with comorbidities, along with the symptoms of it.
32450197,Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms.
32450197,Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations.
32450197,Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses.
32450197,Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens.
32450198,While the World is finding expedited approvals for the development of vaccine, which is time dependent, being preventative and not possibly a cure, physicians and countries' leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that this age-old antimalarial drug, CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection.
32450198,Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.
32450198,There is still a need to find other innovative drug candidates as other possible candidate to go into clinical evaluation and testing.
32450265,To assess perceptions of occupational risk and changes to clinical practice of ophthalmology trainees in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32450265,Survey questions assessed policies guiding COVID-19 response, known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2, changes in clinical duties and volume, and methods to reduce occupational risk including availability of personal protective equipment.
32450265,Additional risk mitigation methods outside of PPE were: reduction in patient volume (n=62, 100%), limiting patient companions (n=59, 95.2%), use of a screening process (n=59, 95.2%), use of a slit lamp face shield (n=57, 91.9%), temperature screening of all persons entering clinical space (n=34, 54.84%), and placement of face mask on patients (n=33, 53.2%).
32450265,Overall, 16.1% reported additional clinical duties within the scope of ophthalmology, and 3.2% reported being re-deployed to non-ophthalmology services.
32450265,No respondents reported loss of employment or reduction in pay or benefits due to COVID-19. and Relevance: Suspected or confirmed clinical exposure to COVID-19 positive patients occurred in approximately one-fifth of trainee respondents.
32450312,Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32450314,The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between March 23, 2020 and April 20, 2020 was obtained from a prospectively maintained database.
32450314,Data of the control group was retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started.
32450344,Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability.
32450344,Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results.
32450409,The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.
32450416,There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts.
32450565,Given the current shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and high infectivity of this virus, we acknowledge the utility of this tool in obtaining important clinical information while minimizing exposure and PPE consumption.
32450718,At least 1 m of distance among people is recommended; however, some clinical practices cannot allow this distance.
32450718,In this context, we believe that the careful safety assessment of clinical settings, like ophthalmologic ones, may have a remarkable impact on the fight against SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32450727,The thin-section CT imaging findings and clinical and laboratory data of all the patients were evaluated.
32450727,There were no significant differences between the 12 confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2-positive) patients and 16 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients in epidemiology and most of the clinical features or laboratory data.
32450732,With encouraging signs of pandemic containment nationwide, the promise of return to a full range of clinical practice is on the horizon.
32450732,Since the COVID-19 pandemic is far from being over and the future may hold other highly communicable infectious threats that may require similar precautions, standard approaches to the clinical evaluation of common otolaryngology complaints will have to be modified.
32450752,Efforts aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and &quot;flattening the curve&quot; may be affecting clinical care delivery for non-COVID-19 cases that include otolaryngologic and orbital conditions.
32450752,We are witnessing changes in the manner that patients present, as well as modifications in clinical management strategies.
32450752,An improved understanding of these phenomena and the contributing factors is essential for otolaryngologists to provide sound clinical care during this unprecedented pandemic.
32450761,We performed a prospective analysis of a series of 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 comparing both tracheostomy techniques, safety, and prognosis clinical markers.
32450906,The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China.
32451162,Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers' safety, were included.
32451162,Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer.
32451271,The basics of the virus, the clinical manifestations, and the possible mechanisms of cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 are reviewed.
32451301,Up to date, there are no reported deaths in pregnant women with Covid-19, while in the cases that have presented pneumonia because of Covid-19, the symptoms have been moderate and with a good prognosis in recovery.
32451351,We agree with the authors that, despite conflicting clinical data to date, it is possible that HCQ may have a protective effect in the setting of COVID-19.
32451351,More importantly, we agree that optimal HCQ dosage and timing is a critical underpinning for clinical trials.
32451353,We would like to share ideas on the report on &quot;Hydroxychloroquine in Patients with Rheumatic Disease Complicated by COVID-19: Clarifying Target Exposures and the Need for Clinical Trials [1].&quot;Balevic noted that &quot;<i>well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine</i> [1].&quot;
32451358,The results of this study suggest a proper PCS algorithm which combines the COVID-19 screening and protection measures could decrease the impact of the disease on the clinical outcomes of EVT for AIS patients to the lowest extent possible during the pandemic.
32451359,Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed.
32451359,Patient clinical outcome was generally poor in this series of patients with COVID-19 large vessel occlusion.
32451362,The purpose of this study was to explore the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
32451362,Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations.
32451362,Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026).
32451366,The needed mitigation measures would significantly strain health system capacities, particularly for secondary and tertiary services, while many cases may pass undetected in primary care facilities due to weak diagnostic capacity and non-specific symptoms.
32451367,We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19.
32451367,While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic.
32451563,COVID-19 has a varied clinical presentation.
32451563,This study identifies specific symptoms and comorbidities predicting severe COVID-19 and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
32451563,Random effects meta-analysis identified symptoms and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 or ICU admission.
32451564,Loss of sense of smell and/or taste was reported by 26 of 63 COVID-19 patients (41%), whereas only 31% of the patients experiencing hyposmia had simultaneous symptoms of rhinitis.
32451564,The data imply that a) COVID-19 can lead to hyposmia in a relevant number of patients, the incidence was approximately 30% in this cohort; b) in most cases, the olfactory disturbance was not associated with nasal obstruction, thus indicating a possible neurogenic origin; and c) the olfactory disorder largely resolved within 1-3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.
32451597,These symptoms are associated with a cytokine storm syndrome.
32451729,In our clinical practice, we do not use corticosteroids routinely; only low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids were given to several severely ill patients prudently.
32451877,Suspected or established COVID-19 patients may also have concomitant cardiovascular symptoms and require further imaging investigations.
32452036,Participants self-reported onset of hand eczema and associated symptoms.
32452036,A high prevalence of symptoms associated with acute hand dermatitis was found in 90.4% across all HCWs, whereas hand eczema itself was underreported (14.9%).
32452050,In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases.
32452195,The diagnosis is based on the exposure history, clinical manifestation, laboratory test results, chest computed tomography (CT) findings and a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32452410,Since SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, data have been needed on the natural fluctuation of viral load and clinical indicators associated with it.
32452545,This can be done retrospectively, reporting on patients in the sample who have already been tested, or prospectively, performing the test on all available patients, regardless of whether they have symptoms.
32452545,The retrospective method has a significant risk of confounding bias: due to the scarcity of COVID-19 tests<sup>8</sup> , they are usually reserved for patients with COVID-19-related symptoms, who are obviously more likely to test positive.
32452644,The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic carries clinical, economic and social burdens that are currently being disclosed.
32452644,Importantly, major concerns derive from the androgen-dependent tissue-expression of both TMPRSS2 and ACE2, suggesting a differential clinical course of the infection between genders.
32452644,On these bases, gender-specific recommendations for the management of male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection are warmly suggested, in order to improve the clinical course of the disease.
32452731,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and chest CT findings in patients with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Thirty patients with diagnosed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection (group A) and 30 patients with diagnosed COVID-19 (group B) were retrospectively enrolled in the present study.
32452731,The clinical characteristics and chest CT findings of the two groups were compared. <b>RESULTS.</b> Fever, cough, expectoration, and dyspnea were the main symptoms in both groups with viral pneumonia, with cough and expectoration more frequently found in group A.
32452739,The objective of this investigation was to quantify airborne aerosol production under clinical and surgical conditions and examine efficacy of mask mitigation strategies.
32452739,Prospective quantification of airborne aerosol generation during surgical and clinical simulation.
32452739,Cadaver laboratory and clinical examination room.

32456064,Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.
32456286,Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.
32456368,Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by COVID-19 is similar to the ARDS caused by other diseases in terms of pathophysiological basis and clinical manifestations, they are also different in many aspects, which lead to different clinical therapies.
32456404,In response to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, clinical trial research assessing the efficacy and safety of experimental vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are emerging at an unprecedented rate.
32456404,The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the preliminary experiences and ongoing clinical trials of the major candidates and challenges of the vaccine strategies in humans.
32456404,Finally, we scrutinized the Cochrane COVID-19 study register and the COVID-19 section of ClinicalTrials.gov database for identifying relevant ongoing clinical trials.
32456404,Our search identified 1359 published papers, 478 pre-print articles and 367 ongoing clinical trials.
32456404,Finally, only ten ongoing clinical trials met the inclusion criteria.
32456404,Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19.

32456944,In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit.
32456944,We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing.
32456944,In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases.
32456944,Most cases are managed as outpatients, however severe symptoms are also appearing and mortality to date is 16.2%.
32456948,Medical records including demographic data, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT), and treatment measures were collected, analyzed, and compared between the two groups.
32456959,Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been linked to ocular signs and symptoms in several case reports.
32456959,All health care professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, and use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks by both the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.
32457027,To appraise the availability, quality, and inclusivity of clinical guidelines produced in the early stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic.
32457027,Clinical guidelines for the management of covid-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) produced by international and national scientific organisations and government and non-governmental organisations relating to global health were included, with no exclusions for language.
32457027,The quality and contents of early covid-19 guidelines were also compared with recent clinical guidelines for MERS and SARS. 2836 studies were identified, of which 2794 were excluded after screening.
32457027,Overall, the clinical guidelines lacked detail and covered a narrow range of topics.
32457027,A framework for development of clinical guidelines during public health emergencies is needed to ensure rigorous methods and the inclusion of vulnerable populations.
32457035,Recent studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 experience relevant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.
32457035,We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the GI symptoms of COVID-19.
32457035,A systematic review of GI symptoms and a meta-analysis comparing symptoms in severe and non-severe patients was performed using RevMan V.5.3.
32457035,Our study revealed that diarrhoea (7.8%) followed by nausea and/or vomiting (5.5 %) were the most common GI symptoms.
32457035,We performed a meta-analysis comparing the odds of having GI symptoms in severe versus non-severe COVID-19-positive patients. 4 studies for nausea and/or vomiting, 5 studies for diarrhoea and 3 studies for abdominal pain were used for the analyses.
32457035,Our study has reiterated that GI symptoms are an important clinical feature of COVID-19.
32457036,In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions.
32457038,Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in pre-clinical studies, without causing NP-C disease.
32457048,We examined differences in demographics, clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection.
32457048,Patients with and without rheumatic disease had similar symptoms and laboratory findings.
32457048,Patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 infection were more likely to require mechanical ventilation but had similar clinical features and hospitalisation rates as those without rheumatic disease.
32457086,Video consultations offer clinical assessment despite restricted movement of people.We undertook a rapid literature review to identify the highest currently available level of evidence to inform this major change in clinical practice.
32457086,For patient safety, it will be critical to follow the WHO guidance regarding: a standard operating procedure; clinical protocols for when video consultations can (and cannot) be used; policies to ensure equity of access in disadvantaged populations; adequate staff training; and administrative support to coordinate appointments.

32457924,Several reports on epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been published.
32457924,We examine the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients who died of COVID-19.
32457924,The clinical and laboratory parameters in the cohort of fatal cases may be incorporated into future clinical prognosis models and will be of help in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.
32457932,Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution.
32458019,There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the length of preoperative symptoms or surgery, need for postoperative peritoneal drainage or the distribution of complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis.
32458042,Virtual interactive tools are well known in different clinical and surgical specialties, and they are considered as a valid support, but it seems that in plastic surgery they are not so used.
32458121,In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.
32458125,To summarize the chest CT imaging and clinical features of the initial COVID-19 patients and provide a clinical diagnostic method that is more effective and can be performed earlier.
32458125,This retrospective study investigated the clinical, laboratory and imaging information of 25 patients in the Luoyang area.
32458125,The median time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 7 days.
32458125,Ninety-two percent of patients had respiratory symptoms, and 8% of them had digestive symptoms.
32458125,Fever (92%), cough (60%) and fatigue (56%) were the most common symptoms.
32458149,In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32458182,Healthcare services must adapt to effectively juggle between pandemic management and maintenance of business-as-usual services so that both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients receive appropriate clinical care.
32458193,COVID-19 patients have presented with a number of different neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, hyposmia, and hypogeusia during the course of illness.
32458197,While it mostly presents with respiratory symptoms, it has already been found that it could manifest with a series of neurological symptoms as well, either at presentation or during the course of the disease.
32458197,Symptoms vary from non-specific such as headache or dizziness to more specific such as convulsions and cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
32458197,Clinicians and especially internists, neurologists, and infectious disease specialists should be aware of these symptoms and able to recognize them early.
32458279,Based on our data analysis, however, remdesivir with IV administration alone is unlikely to achieve excellent clinical efficacy.
32458279,This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32458356,Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions.
32458356,Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms.
32458395,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), it became evident that a proportion of patients may present with gastrointestinal symptoms.
32458395,We report the case of a Covid-19-infected patient who, during recovery from the pulmonary pneumonia, had gastrointestinal symptoms followed by a diastasic right colon perforation due to acute over distension of the bowel.
32458395,This case highlights the importance of paying attention to initial gastrointestinal symptoms in order to prevent possible complications.
32458425,Both patients, including an 81-year-old man who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, showed clinical improvement.
32458502,SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and infection by this virus results in COVID-19, manifesting predominantly respiratory symptoms in the lower respiratory system.
32458502,Suspected COVID-19 patients who had a documented history of exposure and exhibited symptoms, but did not have positive PCR test results, were generally self-quarantined with prescriptions aiming to help attenuate their symptoms.
32458502,There is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help patients relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and to potentially help increase their chances of survival and recovery from the infection.
32458502,This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms.
32458550,This study aimed to estimate the association between anxiety associated with COVID-19 and somatic symptoms, using data from a large, representative sample (N = 2,025) of the UK adult population.
32458550,Results showed that moderate to high levels of anxiety associated with COVID-19 were significantly associated with general somatic symptoms and in particular with gastrointestinal and fatigue symptoms.
32458588,During remote-visits several interventions were conducted: triage for COVID-19 suspected symptoms, email check of clinical pictures and of laboratory examinations, advices for topical and systemic therapy continuation or discontinuation/switch and re-schedule of next appointment.
32458596,The increasing spread of COVID-19 presents challenges for the clinical care of patients with gynecological malignancies.

32458969,Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and outpatient trials results are not expected until September.
32458969,Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy.
32459003,Therefore adjuvants such as retinoids, capable of increasing IFN-I mediated anti-viral responses should be tested in combinations of IFN-I and anti-viral drugs in pre-clinical studies of SARS-CoV-2.
32459123,Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace.
32459123,In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients.
32459123,Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
32459186,The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale.
32459186,Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.
32459192,The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment.
32459192,Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.
32459192,In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
32459192,The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
32459192,This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.

32459675,In mid-March, medical schools suspended all clinical rotations for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year.
32459675,As such, third-year medical students may not be able to complete sufficient clinical experiences to make important career choices before they have to submit their residency applications.
32459675,While the decision to suspend clinical rotations was necessary to protect students, specialty organizations and residency programs must mitigate the deficits in students' clinical education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.In this Perspective, the authors identify potential challenges for third-year medical students and advocate for solutions to improve the residency application process for students and programs.
32459675,First, they propose delaying the date that programs can access applicant data through the Electronic Residency Application Service, thereby affording students more time to complete clinical experiences, solidify their specialty decision, and strengthen their residency application.

32460566,Students reported a basic level of COVID-19 knowledge, but few students (18%, <i>n</i> = 173/966) correctly identified all three signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19.
32460624,Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: &quot;mild&quot;,symbolized as a &quot;drizzle&quot; of cytokines, severe as a &quot;storm&quot;, and critical as a &quot;hurricane&quot;.
32460624,In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage.
32460632,Herpesvirus infections can occur as primary or nosocomial pathogens but clinical manifestations most commonly are re-activation of latent viral infection.
32460632,This is an area of active study, and further research is needed to better understand the risks, clinical manifestations, and attributable morbidity and mortality of viral infections. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients.

32461285,The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.
32461325,Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported as potential symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019.
32461325,This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32461325,Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire.
32461325,The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0-359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9-29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.6).
32461325,We found a strong association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
32461325,These symptoms should be considered as common and distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should serve as an indication for testing and possible retesting of people whose first test result is negative.
32461326,We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting.
32461415,Overall, 7,008 tele-calls were addressed, of which 2,805 (40.02%) patients where a clinical-related query was answered were included for analysis.

32462378,Common symptoms included fever (15 cases), cough (21 cases), and fatigue (7 cases).
32462412,Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known.
32462412,They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures.
32462412,Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies.
32462412,Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury.
32462412,Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy.
32462423,In Italy, from March 8, 2020, all the deferrable clinical activities have been suspended to increase the health care offer for COVID-19 patients.

32462990,CDT can be an additional therapeutic option in patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism that present with rapid clinical collapse.
32463026,Clinical studies have documented that potentially severe neurological symptoms are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby suggesting direct CNS penetration by the virus.
32463076,Viral load of asymptomatic carriers is comparable to symptomatic patients, viral shedding is highest before symptom onset suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms.
32463076,Extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients.
32463179,In the absence of clinical trial results, we analyzed epidemiological data to support or discard such hypothesis.
32463186,In this setting, pulmonary embolism may cause further respiratory distress and clinical deterioration.
32463186,We describe the clinical course of three patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress, where pulmonary embolism was detected during the course of the hospitalisation.
32463186,Further research is required to establish appropriate clinical management guidelines for prevention of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.
32463289,Data from a Veterans Affairs medical center's posttraumatic stress disorder clinical team suggest that not only are veterans interested in continuing with treatment but also that the treatments can be modified to accommodate the current climate.
32463308,In addition to flu-like respiratory symptoms, acute cardiac manifestations include cardiac injury, shock and arrhythmia.
32463308,How great the risk is relative to the benefit in critically ill COVID-19 patients will need to await the outcome of ongoing, controlled clinical trials.
32463348,Background Despite a lack of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected COVID-19.
32463367,People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods.
32463367,While relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements.
32463395,Clinical presentations and pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 are broad.
32463543,Moreover, evaluating and treating HF patients with comorbid COVID-19 represents a formidable clinical challenge as symptoms of both conditions may overlap and they may potentiate each other.
32463543,Therefore, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology and Chinese Heart Failure Association &amp; National Heart Failure Committee conducted web-based meetings to discuss these unique clinical challenges and reach a consensus opinion to help providers worldwide deliver better patient care.
32463545,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 run from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32463802,45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with an additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing.
32463803,We performed a flow cytometric characterization of immune cells subsets from 30 COVID-19 patients and correlated these data with clinical outcomes.
32463803,This study was supported by funds of Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine of University of Florence (ex-60%) derived from Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca (Italy).
32463809,During March 29-April 23, all SNF residents, regardless of symptoms, underwent serial (approximately weekly) nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, and positive results were communicated to the county health department.
32463809,All SNF clinical and nonclinical staff members were also screened for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR during March 29-April 10.
32463809,Among these residents, eight developed symptoms 1-5 days after specimen collection and were later classified as presymptomatic; one of these patients died.
32464084,The aim of this ongoing study is to present the current epidemiological and sociodemographic parameters of 380 COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (UCH Mostar) during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32464158,After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data.
32464271,Here, we suggest that this disparity in fatality rates may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 evolving mutations and urge the international community to begin addressing the phylogenetic clade classification of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to clinical outcomes.
32464297,Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, four primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment.
32464333,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250 ml of wastewaters collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data.
32464367,CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection.
32464579,Based on clinical signs, 71 (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively.
32464585,We report a para-infectious encephalitis patient with clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings during evolution and convalescence phase of coronavirus infection.

32464587,The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting.
32464662,We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population.
32464662,Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units.
32464685,Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a drastic reduction of routine clinical activities and a consequent risk of looser connections between LVAD patients and their referring center.
32464700,Preliminary clinical data fully support such initiatives.
32464700,The response to the COVID-19 epidemic highlights the importance of capacity building for an organized and sustainable national blood system while steps are taken to provide appropriately collected, tested and processed COVID-19 convalescent plasma for investigational clinical use.
32464707,We describe cases of patients in New York City presenting with stroke secondary to large vessel thrombosis without occlusion, incidentally found to have COVID-19 with only mild respiratory symptoms.
32466164,We evaluated the mental health burden of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on physical therapists, including their stress and anxiety levels, who were at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms.
32466164,Among the 65 physical therapists who completed our survey, 21 (32.3%) and 12 (18.5%) physical therapists reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively.
32466477,Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are under development, and clinical trials of several drugs are ongoing. international cooperation is an important way to accelerate research progress and achieve success.
32466623,We investigated whether lung function measurements at home were comparable to measurements during clinical visits.
32466623,Paired FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were included if the measurement on the home monitor was performed on the same day as the FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement on the pneumotachometer during a two monthly clinical visit.
32466623,The mean difference (home measurement was subtracted from clinical measurement) in FEV<sub>1</sub> was 0.18 L in CF (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.27 L; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and 0.12 L in asthma (95%CI 0.05-0.19 L; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
32466623,FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements at home were significantly lower than clinically obtained FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements, which has implications for the application of this technique in the daily clinical situation.
32466735,The aim of this study was to describe specific clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with a history of stroke.
32466735,Clinical data were analyzed and compared between patients with and without a history of stroke.

32466736,Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to stroke onset was 6 days.
32466736,All patients had brain imaging within 3 hours from symptoms onset.
32466738,Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed &gt;30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.
32466738,It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.
32466862,The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19.
32467007,The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion.
32467007,After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient.
32467101,The pandemic is the cause of significant mortality and with this the need for rapidly disseminated information for palliative care professionals regarding the prevalence of symptoms, their intensity, their resistance or susceptibility to symptom control and the mode of death for patients.
32467101,We undertook a systematic review of published evidence for symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (with a specific emphasis on symptoms at end of life) and on modes of death.
32467101,Cough, breathlessness, fatigue and myalgia are significant symptoms in people hospitalised with COVID-19.
32467101,Rapid data gathering on the mode of death and the profile of symptoms in the dying and their prevalence and severity in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent will provide important intelligence for clinicians.
32467101,This should be done urgently, within ethical norms and the practicalities of a public health, clinical and logistical emergency.
32467113,To examine presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with ESKD on dialysis, we retrospectively collected clinical data on 59 patients on dialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19.
32467113,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (49%) and cough (39%); initial radiographs most commonly showed multifocal or bilateral opacities (59%).
32467124,We present a case of a patient with minimal respiratory symptoms but prominent bilateral groundglass opacities in a 'crazy paving' pattern on chest CT imaging and a negative initial infectious workup.
32467124,This case illustrates the importance of clinical vigilance to retest patients for COVID-19, particularly in the absence of another compelling aetiology.

32468014,Despite the very fast and large flow of scientific data on possible treatment solutions, none have yet demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
32468014,Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, and target based methods are the most used strategies to advance therapeutic solutions into clinical practice.
32468052,The novel hypotheses that are stemming out of these data need to be further investigated and validated in large clinical studies.
32468193,However, it is assumed that these patients are at high risk, because of respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function.
32468196,We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for COVID-19.
32468196,In one trial, the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant (21 vs 23 days, HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87-1.75), although the study was underpowered.
32468196,Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe COVID-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation.
32468196,Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.
