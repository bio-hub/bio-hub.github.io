31967321,The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome.
31986261,Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold.
31986264,To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence.
31992388,Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus.
31995857,The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor.
31996437,Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.
31997390,Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019-nCoV cross-species transmission.
32004758,An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
32007145,Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.
32009128,No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.
32019669,In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.
32022275,Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.
32023682,From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020.
32023686,Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.
32027035,Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.
32027631,None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.
32027812,Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure.
32031570,They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset.
32031583,They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.
32033514,Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.
32035997,The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
32036774,Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
32046137,Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

32048815,A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32049687,We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
32050080,All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.
32051071,We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.
32053579,Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.
32054045,Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.
32054124,Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.
32056407,By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.
32060789,Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).
32064854,Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
32067043,One family cluster was found.
32070465,Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).
32074480,Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.
32074719,All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.
32074786,Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.
32075786,Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.
32077661,The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.
32077664,Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

32080990,A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in Wuhan, China.
32081428,Information on reported cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission.
32081636,While the overall severity profile among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%).
32086938,The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.
32087334,We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.
32087820,We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.
32088598,We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.
32088679,In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.
32091395,Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.
32092296,The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.
32093211,The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.
32098289,In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.
32098302,With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).
32099934,On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.
32100667,Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.
32100877,Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.
32104911,(Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.).
32104917,Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
32105680,Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.
32106216,Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV.
32107119,First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor.
32108495,Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection.
32110742,Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission.
32111262,Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections.
32112082,These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003.
32112886,Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.
32113198,One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.
32113704,Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.
32114744,This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.
32119825,To investigate the genetic diversity, time origin, and evolutionary history of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and Thailand, a total of 12 genome sequences of the virus with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (primarily Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, but also Bangkok, Thailand) were analyzed.
32119961,Phylogenetic and likelihood-mapping analyses of these genome sequences were performed.
32124000,On the basis of our results, the star-like signal and topology of 2019-nCoV may be indicative of potentially large &quot;first generation&quot; human-to-human virus transmission.
32125129,We estimated that 2019-nCoV likely originated in Wuhan on 9 November 2019 (95% credible interval: 25 September 2019 and 19 December 2019), and that Wuhan is the major hub for the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere.
32125269,Our results could be useful for designing effective prevention strategies for 2019-nCoV in China and beyond.
32125362,A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China.
32127123,Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.
32127517,Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.
32129580,Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences.
32129581,Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.
32129843,The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.
32131906,We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.
32131908,These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.
32133152,In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.
32133830,A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32133831,As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.
32134116,We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
32134381,Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.
32134861,Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.
32134909,Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.
32138488,Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.
32141058,The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.
32141279,Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).
32141619,Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.
32142651,Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.
32143990,Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.
32144116,Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.
32144890,The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

32145466,Pathogen transmission from a vertebrate animal to a human, also known as zoonotic spillover, represents a global public health burden, which while associated with multiple outbreaks, still remains a poorly understood phenomenon.
32145768,Coronaviruses, like influenza viruses, circulate in nature in various animal species.
32146245,Alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses can infect mammals and gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses tend to infect birds, but some of them can also be transmitted to mammals.
32146445,Although still preliminary, current data suggest that bats are the most probable initial source of the current 2019 novel CoV (2019nCoV) outbreak, that begun on December 2019 in Wuhan, China, apparently spreading from a &quot;wet market&quot; to multiple cities and provinces in China.
32146554,This epidemic of 2019nCoV, already reaching more than 6,000 cases to-day (end of January 2020) (&gt;90% in China), will not be the last one linked to zoonotic spillover events.
32146694,Since December 2019, China has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia.
32147731,We estimated the basic reproduction number <i>R0</i> of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.
32149037,Transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and pandemic influenza, indicating a risk of global spread.
32149043,A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy.
32149484,In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases.
32151335,A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank.
32152361,Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4.
32154135,The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy.
32154287,Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well.
32156101,In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission.
32156332,Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.
32156607,The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China's public health and clinical treatment.
32161092,The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia.
32161941,The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons.
32162212,According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV.
32163030,After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines.
32164400,The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network.
32165283,It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.
32165854,2019年岁末，在武汉暴发新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）引起的肺炎流行，给我国公共卫生和临床救治带来巨大挑战。
32166600,2019-nCoV属于冠状病毒科β冠状病毒属，与严重急性呼吸综合征相关冠状病毒（SARS-CoV）和中东呼吸综合征相关冠状病毒（MERS-CoV）近缘，都会导致严重肺炎症状。
32167146,该病毒经飞沫、接触等途径传播，潜伏期患者即具备传播性。
32168465,目前数据表明：2019-nCoV比SARS-CoV毒力弱，但传播力强；造成其能够跨种传播的受体可能与SARS-CoV一致，都是血管紧张素转化酶Ⅱ（ACE2）。
32169119,在此疾病暴发后，我国科技人员投入大量精力开展研究，快速开发出诊断试剂，初步确定了病原特性，并已筛选出可能抑制该病毒的临床药物，也正在加快研发疫苗。
32171059,2019-nCoV的出现再次提醒我们建立系统的冠状病毒监测网络的重要性；也给突发疫情防控和应急科研提出了新挑战。.
32171622,In December 2019, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) in wuhan, China, attracting attention worldwidely.
32173241,The novel coronavirus has the characteristics of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, and easy to affect both lungs, leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, as well as difficult to detection and assessment at early stage.
32174057,Fever, cough, myalgia, weakness, dyspnea and imagings may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32174096,At the same time, the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations, hypoxia degree, age, basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used to evaluate the severity of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32176808,2019年12月中国武汉爆发的新型冠状病毒肺炎（2019-novel coronavirus，2019-nCoV）引发了全球广泛关注，新型冠状病毒具有传播速度快，临床症状不典型、双肺易受累等特点，易导致漏诊误诊，早期识别及病情评估困难。
32178768,发热、咳嗽、肌痛、乏力、呼吸困难等症状及影像学表现可有助于新型冠状病毒肺炎的早期识别。
32178970,同时病情进展速度、发热情况、CT表现、缺氧程度、年龄、基础疾病、实验室指标等可作为新型冠状病毒肺炎病情程度的评估依据。.
32179150,To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed.
32179660,Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed.
32179701,On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts.
32180292,We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains.
32180426,The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 × 10<sup>-3</sup> to 1.8266 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year.
32181807,On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV transmission in real-time.
32182347,On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China.
32183901,On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1).
32185669,As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2).
32185921,Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2).
32187007,As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States.
32187887,On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.<sup>†</sup> On January 31, the U.S.
32188819,Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.<sup>§</sup> Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a &quot;Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,&quot; which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3).
32190290,CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5).
32190785,These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States.
32191173,These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States.
32191676,Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32192295,Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely.
32192580,As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.
32194239,This is the first epidemiological report of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory disease infections reported in Australia at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 1 February 2020.
32195704,It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week 26 January to 1 February 2020 and in the previous week (19 to 25 January 2020), the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV infection.
32195887,In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China.
32196410,The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
32196426,To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.
32196655,Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.
32198088,Documented NCIP.
32198190,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32198501,Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared.
32198708,Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.
32199943,Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.
32199996,Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]).
32200634,Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]).
32201335,Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%).
32202261,Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients.
32202343,Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]).
32202489,Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]).
32202911,The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.
32203711,Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]).
32205090,Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).
32205232,As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized.
32205269,Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).
32207679,In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.
32207910,A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease.
32208917,This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses.
32209164,The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China.
32210236,Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries.
32210421,Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission.
32210742,Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients.
32211911,We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome.
32212059,The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus.
32212103,These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls.
32213269,In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested.
32213270,Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction).
32213332,Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction.
32213647,All negative control samples were negative in the assays.
32213786,Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests.
32214086,The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.
32215622,Infection with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, airborne transmission and direct contact.
32215956,However, conducting bronchoscopy on patients with 2019-nCoV is a high-risk procedure in which health care workers are directly exposed to the virus, and the protection and operation procedures need to be strictly regulated.
32217113,According to the characteristics of bronchoscopy, it is necessary to formulate the procedure, requirements and precautions when conducting bronchoscopy in the current epidemic situation.
32217947,Relevant standards for preventing from infections should be strictly implemented in the operation of bronchoscopy.
32218527,It needs to emphasize that bronchoscopy should not be used as a routine means for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection sampling.
32219625,The indications for bronchoscopy for other diseases should be strictly mastered, and it is suggested that bronchoscopy should be postponed for those patients who is not in urgent situation.
32219626,2019新型冠状病毒（2019 novel coronavirus，2019-nCoV）感染感染主要通过呼吸道飞沫传播、空气传播及接触传播，结合支气管镜操作的特点，制订了当前疫情下支气管镜诊疗操作的流程、要求及注意事项。
32219674,进行支气管镜诊疗操作时须严格执行传染病防控相关标准，强调了支气管镜检查不作为诊断新冠感染采样的常规手段，在按要求做好防护的基础上，严格掌握支气管镜诊疗适应证，如非病情急需，建议暂缓检查。.
32219814,Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans.
32219845,Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces.
32220177,We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities.
32220275,The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.
32220650,Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.
32220655,As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.
32222988,Coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory, enteric and systemic infections in a wide range of hosts including man, mammals, fish, and avian.
32222992,The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV).
32222995,This decade's first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32223490,As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines).
32223774,In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries.
32224133,The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin.
32224151,The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus.
32224986,The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well.
32225175,The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.
32226285,Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries.
32226286,Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity.
32226291,A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures.
32227758,The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23).
32227799,Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value.
32228808,It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained.
32228809,Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value.
32228825,With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.
32229157,The global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high.
32229433,In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus.
32229706,A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank.
32231348,We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients.
32232217,The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the <i>Rhinolophus</i> bat family.
32232433,In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2019.
32232652,These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to <i>Betacoronavirus</i>.
32232915,Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of <i>Betacoronavirus</i> among animals and <i>Rhinolophus</i> of the bat family.
32233034,To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32233064,Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
32233562,The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues.
32233563,The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS.
32234115,It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility.
32234117,Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.
32234128,In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries).
32234250,The disease is officially named as the Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable communicable disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health.
32234343,SSCP is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%) mortality rate.
32234451,Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of stringent infection control or no proper personal protective equipment available.
32234468,Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under investigation.
32234805,To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of travel or contact history for patients with compatible symptoms.
32235085,This is the second epidemiological report for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), previously known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 8 February 2020.
32235945,It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week ending 19:00 AEDT 8 February 2020, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread of the COVID-19 infection.
32237160,Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been prevalent in China.
32237901,Due to immaturity of immune function and the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, neonates are particularly susceptible to 2019-nCoV.
32238084,The perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take integrated approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the emergency plan for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the optimal management and treatment of potential victims.
32238336,According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics puts forward recommendations for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection in neonates.
32238612,In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in central China's Hubei Province.
32238613,Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1).
32238615,As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3).
32238673,On January 17, CDC and the U.S.
32239127,Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4).
32240078,CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2).
32240079,As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection.
32240094,Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks.
32240128,Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.
32240285,Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission.
32240756,Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6).
32240973,Providers should consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the United States.
32241097,Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human transmission.
32241325,It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias.
32241328,To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market.
32241761,As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.
32241897,The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020.
32241899,The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA.
32242349,Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China.
32243068,Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries.
32243269,Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission.
32243296,Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]).
32243317,However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]).
32243599,This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.
32243607,Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been spreading from Wuhan, China.
32243668,The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China.
32243677,As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections.
32243678,The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Korea.
32243690,He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission.
32244041,This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission.
32244059,Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China.
32244166,Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.
32244260,Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first Disease X.
32244841,Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-nCoV, which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its potential bat origin.
32245814,With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics.
32246136,Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as &quot;transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)&quot; and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV.

32268381,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China.
32268634,Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease.
32268640,As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice.
32268643,For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP.
32268644,Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (&gt;37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days.
32269018,Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible.
32269087,Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC).
32269597,Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed.
32270184,For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority.
32270371,Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer).
32270498,Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms.
32271070,Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply.
32271208,For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery.
32271457,Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding.
32271461,However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail.
32271597,All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department.
32271601,All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area.
32271722,Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission.
32271724,Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery.
32271726,Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary.
32271728,Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP.
32271947,Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures.
32272080,We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.
32272089,当前，我国新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称&quot;新冠肺炎&quot;）的疫情形势严峻，全国医护人员都义不容辞地肩负起了抗击疫情的重任。
32273156,作为胃肠外科医师，我们应积极学习新冠肺炎的相关知识，科学应对，把防疫的意识渗透到临床工作的每个诊疗细节和临床操作中去。
32273245,对于胃肠肿瘤患者，首先应做好入院前筛查，肺部CT应作为常规检查项目。
32273490,经过严密筛查的患者入院后术前检查时需加强防护措施，包括医护人员的自我防护；诊疗过的器械或物品应妥善丢弃，或按规范流程进行消毒，严防交叉感染。
32275072,对于胃肠道良性肿瘤，如无合并明显出血或梗阻，不建议在这个非常时期进行手术治疗，可待疫情高峰期过后择期手术。
32275082,对于进展期胃肠恶性肿瘤患者，建议经过多学科联合会诊（MDT），如果符合新辅助治疗指征，应优先选择新辅助治疗而推迟手术。
32275257,胃肠道肿瘤合并梗阻或出血的病例可考虑通过内镜或介入治疗解除梗阻或止血；若肿瘤合并出血保守治疗及内镜治疗无效，可尝试于介入下进行选择性血管栓塞；合并梗阻但没有合并腹膜炎者，肠道支架置入具有较高的解除梗阻成功率，大部分患者可免于急诊手术。
32275260,对于胃窦肿瘤合并胃潴留、食管胃结合部肿瘤合并食管梗阻的患者，可留置胃管和空肠营养管，进行减压和营养支持以缓解症状，为限期手术创造更好的身体情况。
32275288,对于确实需要手术、且疑似或确诊新冠肺炎患者，在向医院、疾控中心进行报备的前提下，最好转至定点医院诊治，或于专门隔离病区进行术前准备、专门的通道进行转运以及专门的感染手术室进行手术；麻醉医师在三级预防的基础上注意配戴防护面罩进行气管插管及拔管，以防飞沫喷溅。
32275295,对于下消化道手术，应更积极行预防性肠造口。
32275978,术后对手术间进行彻底消毒。
32276139,对于手术后发热患者，应与新冠肺炎相鉴别，若伴咳嗽、咳痰者，应按疑似新冠肺炎病例的标准进行单间隔离和相关检查。
32276282,相信通过医患双方的共同努力，取得这场防疫战争的胜利将指日可待！.
32276755,To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).
32277021,Retrospective case series.
32277162,Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection.
32277203,Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.
32277486,Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period.
32277759,If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.
32277845,Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study.
32278065,According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission.
32278147,The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%).
32278168,Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission.
32278670,The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.
32278693,As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.
32278725,Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have been infected.
32278758,A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
32278764,As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32279064,Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9.
32279309,For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32279441,When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask.
32281124,(11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32281231,自首例新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊以来，已有大量人传人的病例，其中超过1700例医护人员遭受了感染。
32281368,对危重症患者进行呼吸治疗时有大量高危操作，例如气管插管、简易呼吸器辅助通气、无创正压通气、高流量鼻导管治疗、气管镜检查、吸痰以及转运等均可引起或加重患者气道内呼出病毒的大量传播。
32281391,因此，我们根据目前最佳证据以及国内现有条件制定了本防范建议，旨在降低医护人员感染风险的同时为患者提供最佳治疗。.
32281674,Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a new respiratory infectious disease, has become an important public health problem.
32281689,Inappropriate protection and disinfection measures are potential risk factors of transmission and outbreak of NCP in key places.
32283139,This theme issue is concerned with the prevention and control of NCP.
32283156,Comprehensive measures and suggestions for protection and disinfection are put forward from perspectives of functional areas in key places, such as hotels, mobile cabin hospitals, passenger transport stations and public transport facilities, environment and facilities, personal protection, operation management system, etc., so as to provide technical support for the prevention and control of new respiratory infectious diseases.
32283268,以新型冠状病毒肺炎为代表的新发呼吸道传染病传播与流行成为一个重要的公共卫生问题。
32283283,重点场所防护和消毒措施不当是新型冠状病毒肺炎传播和流行的潜在风险因素。
32283308,本期重点号以新型冠状病毒肺炎防控为着眼点，从宾馆、方舱医院、客运场站和公共交通工具等重点场所功能分区、环境与设施、个人防护、运行管理制度等多方面、多角度提出防护与消毒的综合措施与建议，期望为新发呼吸道传染病防控提供技术支持。.
32283498,An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019.
32283711,With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred.
32283878,At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020.
32284276,At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO.
32284613,It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought.
32285338,Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control.
32285380,More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina.
32286679,According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.
32286909,Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is found to cause a large outbreak started from Wuhan since December 2019 in China and SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported with epidemiological linkage to China in 25 countries until now.
32286910,We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the oropharyngeal sample obtained from the patient with the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea.
32288414,Cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vero cell cultures were confluent 3 days after the first blind passage of the sample.
32289090,Coronavirus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy.
32289868,Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 reported from Wuhan.
32290445,2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV.
32291278,We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells.
32292213,The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures.
32292252,However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV.
32292261,Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32292300,A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2.
32292527,ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals.
32292622,Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets.
32292627,However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible.
32292686,Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.
32292802,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue.
32292868,As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with &gt;99% of cases being detected in China.
32292880,On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern.
32292898,SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
32292902,It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58.
32292906,Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough.
32292914,Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest.
32293225,The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China.
32293910,Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used.
32294270,However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.
32294574,To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China.
32294617,Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19.
32294667,Comparisons between the viruses were made.
32294813,Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
32295323,Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.
32296168,Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.
32296777,The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.
32296808,We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.
32296884,Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.
32297593,At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the world.
32297723,To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections.
32298028,Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures.
32298029,Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.
32298036,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries.
32298055,Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation.
32298208,In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case.
32298227,The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity.
32298246,Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.
32298249,We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country.
32298250,We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index.
32298273,Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.
32298643,Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks.
32299205,Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability.
32299206,We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively.
32300018,Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations.
32300101,Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.
32300673,EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020, Agence Nationale de la Recherche.
32300968,The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in Wuhan, China.
32301390,Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020.
32301491,Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial.
32302058,Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals.
32302216,Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable.
32302257,To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures.
32302377,According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
32302399,Seafood tanks, air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from various sources.
32302953,The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited.
32303077,On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China.
32303395,The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019.
32303420,Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses.
32303480,As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with &gt; 100 known deaths.
32303575,As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare.
32304371,Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.
32304387,Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence.
32304508,While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant.
32304509,Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic.
32304512,There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission?
32304561,What is the animal reservoir?
32304643,Is there an intermediate animal reservoir?
32304928,Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV?
32304942,We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines.
32304970,We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.
32305046,Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/laboratory-diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus.
32305459,Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response.
32306118,Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015).
32306656,Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters.
32306853,Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people.
32307115,Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed.
32307322,Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.
32308494,These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.
32309267,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.
32310028,Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths.
32310715,Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea.
32311132,A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes.
32311303,The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP.
32311320,Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP.
32311350,Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members.
32311380,In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
32311771,A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease.
32312021,Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world.
32312163,As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities.
32312364,The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32312477,Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain.
32313361,The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis.
32313785,The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed.
32313806,No specific therapeutic drug has been found.
32313825,The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease.
32313879,Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.
32314249,The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government.
32314790,Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic's epicenter.
32315124,Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China.
32315244,Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports.
32315756,Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases.
32315808,Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang.
32316337,Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65-81 cases (upper bounds: 169-507) in Guangdong and an additional 44-354 (upper bounds: 141-875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020.
32316618,In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.
32316751,Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
32317235,This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans.
32317433,Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency.
32317810,Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February.
32319446,Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States.
32319519,Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection.
32320381,As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown.
32320516,The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection.
32320641,Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time.
32320687,In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.
32321662,The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population.
32321705,It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period.
32321903,With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate.
32322107,Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised.
32322401,By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th<sup>,</sup> 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions.
32322691,We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak.
32323279,Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation.
32323287,The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.
32323704,Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020.
32324530,The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries.
32324720,We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination.
32325096,We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32325426,We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk).
32325930,During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world.
32326274,The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97).
32326426,According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile.
32326509,Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case.
32326602,In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case.
32327608,In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected.
32327758,The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada).
32328338,Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries.
32328595,From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed the species barriers to infect humans, causing thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths, respectively.
32329337,Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has become the cause of the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was discovered.
32329522,Until 18 February 2020, there were 72 533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10 644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China.
32329971,SARS-CoV-2 is spreading among the public and causing substantial burden due to its human-to-human transmission.
32330209,However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear.
32330309,Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic.
32330313,In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32330332,The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that, other than pangolins and snakes, as previously suggested, turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
32330439,To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed.
32330458,To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we reanalyzed virome data sets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene.
32330531,We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes.
32330561,Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 and 1.19 to 1.31 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year, respectively.
32330565,Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378).
32330858,We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility.
32331259,Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif.
32331516,Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins.
32331980,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries.
32332334,Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-Cov-2]) nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations.
32332516,In addition, high false-negative rates were reported.
32333185,There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.
32333603,We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages.
32333619,With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses.
32333850,The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites.
32334115,The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%.
32334160,In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples.
32334163,The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood.
32334164,The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.
32335053,It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.
32335167,Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32335171,Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy.
32335334,Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death.
32335338,Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset.
32335340,Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2-14 days).
32335405,Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness.
32335407,Children have been rarely reported.
32335408,Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54-73%).
32335410,Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea.
32335585,Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
32335609,Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients.
32336042,Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate.
32336079,In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults.
32336150,Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases.
32336243,All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.
32336586,Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse.
32336594,For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%.
32336927,Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients.
32337113,Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women.
32337131,Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion.
32337143,Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm.
32337192,For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died.
32337386,Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm.
32337584,No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome.
32338017,Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
32338347,Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring.
32338533,Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations.
32338767,Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly.
32339250,Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).
32339382,An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the United States (1).
32340022,As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1).
32340089,There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States.
32340093,Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.
32340094,This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States.
32340097,These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission.
32340347,Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32340538,U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners.
32340546,Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html.
32340627,As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities.
32340912,With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world.
32341722,The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32342026,The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32342047,Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans.
32342112,All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses.
32342138,Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common.
32342164,Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products.
32342724,Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas.
32342873,In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.
32342926,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pulmonary illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, more than 79,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide.
32343122,The virus is rapidly spreading with human-to-human transmission despite imposed precautions.
32343222,Because similar pulmonary syndromes have been reported from other strains of the coronavirus family, our aim is to review the lessons from imaging studies obtained during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The review of experiences with the MERS and SARS outbreaks will help us better understand the role of the radiologist in combating the outbreak of COVID-19.
32343244,The known imaging manifestations of the novel coronavirus and the possible unknowns will also be discussed.
32343300,The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32343342,While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China.
32343747,The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day.
32343939,The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated.
32344422,We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei.
32344444,We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China.
32344679,Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.
32345392,Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409-7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128-1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.
32346544,Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588-13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.
32346593,Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th).
32346656,We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces.
32346664,Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.
32347054,As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020.
32347112,The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020.
32347198,This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus.
32347618,In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection.
32347772,Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model.
32347991,The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.
32348044,The value of R<sub>0</sub> was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.
32348046,Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.
32348048,A well 6-month-old infant with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had persistently positive nasopharyngeal swabs to day 16 of admission.
32348293,This case highlights the difficulties in establishing the true incidence of COVID-19 as asymptomatic individuals can excrete the virus.
32348405,These patients may play important roles in human-to-human transmission in the community.
32348581,Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing.
32348594,We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.

32354631,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.
32355131,Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19.
32355392,Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments.
32355837,Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak.
32355863,Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.
32355904,In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.
32356641,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical characteristics and placental pathology of 2019-nCoV infection in pregnancy, and to evaluate intrauterine vertical transmission potential of 2019-nCoV infection. <b>Methods:</b> The placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and retrospectively studied.

32360552,Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32360580,Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response.
32360770,Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.
32360780,We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak.
32360881,We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen.
32360960,We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections.
32361152,We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model.
32361161,Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total.
32361443,We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.
32361455,Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R<sub>0</sub> of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset.
32361460,Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R<sub>0</sub> of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced.
32361528,To control the majority of outbreaks, for R<sub>0</sub> of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R<sub>0</sub> of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.
32361598,The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R<sub>0</sub> was 1·5.
32361692,For R<sub>0</sub> values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.
32361714,In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.
32361738,The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.
32361996,This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

32362270,A newly emerged Human Coronavirus (HCoV) is reported two months ago in Wuhan, China (COVID-19).
32362424,Until today &gt;2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries.
32362505,Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago.
32362564,Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for &gt;8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths.
32362642,Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases.
32362645,The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
32362647,In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp.
32362682,Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin.
32362969,The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease.
32363205,The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs.
32363596,Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection.
32364890,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a global health threat.
32365045,The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients.
32365178,Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed.
32365180,The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts.
32366034,A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted.
32366173,First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill.
32366195,In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days.
32366488,Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided.
32367576,Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets.
32367793,All elective clinical services were suspended.
32367847,Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff.
32368429,Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented.
32368528,All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea.
32368532,Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted.
32368550,We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic.
32368850,In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.
32368884,Since December 2019, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) , an emerging infection disease occurred in Wuhan, has spread in the mainland China.
32369217,The epidemic factors on the basis of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 were discussed in this paper.
32369429,This puts a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care.
32369475,SARS-CoV-2 is a novel corona virus, the onset of COVID-19 is slow, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear and may lead to multiple organ damage.
32369975,These put a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care.
32370128,Source of infection including the patients, asymptomatic carrier and patients in the incubation period are contagious.
32370275,It is difficult to control source of infection.
32370924,Routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission are diversified and the main routes of transmission for COVID-19 are droplet transmission and close contact transmission.
32371150,All population have susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
32371331,Social factors such population movements and aggregation accelerated the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32371416,The Chinese government's adopted measures are positive and effective, and are accepted by the expert group from the World Health Organization.
32371560,However, it will be a long-term hard work in the future to seriously summarize and think deeply to achieve public health security in China.

32373189,但认真总结，深入思考，从全局和长远谋划、实现中国乃至全球公共卫生安全将是今后一个相当长期的艰苦工作。.
32373409,Since early January 2020, after the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, ≈365 confirmed cases have been reported in Shenzhen, China.
32373467,The mode of community and intrafamily transmission is threatening residents in Shenzhen.
32373705,Strategies to strengthen prevention and interruption of these transmissions should be urgently addressed.
32374001,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.
32374400,To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.
32374647,Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.
32374823,Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32375144,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool.
32375197,Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.
32375455,Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%).
32375884,Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care.
32376317,There were no deaths.
32377018,Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine.
32377462,Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir.
32377486,For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure.
32377559,Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.
32377932,Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection.
32378460,Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.
32378729,A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19.
32378762,Most cases and sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy.
32379015,Since the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.
32379199,A novel β-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries.
32379592,The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32379707,The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13.
32379731,The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route.
32379733,The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments.
32379909,Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV.
32380010,Here we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.
32380453,Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and close contact.
32381073,Pulmonary function testing procedures have been associated with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients/subjects and medical staffs.
32381147,Effective prevention and control strategies must be compulsorily implemented to prevent nosocomial infection.
32381375,This recommendation is intended to be followed by healthcare workers (HCWs) of pulmonary function testing laboratory when COVID-19 is in epidemic.
32382001,Based on the features of pulmonary function testing, precaution principles and strategies are developed in three aspects of management for HCWs, operating procedure, environment and equipment.
32382154,Indications of pulmonary function testing should be followed strictly.
32382259,It is strongly recommended to suspend the test for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative.
32382449,Medical personnel should mandatorily adhere to the standard stratification of precaution measures.
32382748,Patients/Subjects should be isolated in a separate area for testing.
32383125,Disposable in-line filters must be used during pulmonary function testing.
32383171,Cleaning and disinfection procedures for environment and equipment in pulmonary function testing laboratory should be paid more attention.

32384159,主要强调在疫情流行期间，必须严格掌握肺功能检查的适应证，强烈建议COVID-19确诊病例或疑似病例在传染期内暂缓检查，其他病患如非病情急需也暂缓检查；肺功能室医务人员应严格执行标准分级防护措施；受试者应在单独区域进行隔离检查；检查时必须使用一次性呼吸过滤器；并重视肺功能检查环境和设备的清洁消毒。.
32384228,Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan has spread rapidly due to population movement during the Spring Festival holidays.
32384377,Since January 23rd, 2020, the strategies of containment and contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation has been implemented extensively in mainland China, and the rates of detection and confirmation have been continuously increased, which have effectively suppressed the rapid spread of the epidemic.
32384412,In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is of great practical significance to analyze the transmission risk of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of prevention and control strategies by using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of real-time updated multi-source data.
32385067,On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data.
32385126,By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.
32385219,自2019年12月以来，武汉爆发的COVID-19疫情由于春节人口流动快速蔓延，自2020年1月23日起全国大范围实施围堵缓疫策略，并不断提高检测和检出率，有效地抑制了疫情快速蔓延的趋势。
32385225,在COVID-19爆发的早期，如何利用数学模型并结合少量和实时更新的多源数据，对疫情进行风险分析，评估防控策略的有效性和时效性等具有非常重要的现实意义。

32386433,A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 75,000 individuals and spread to over 20 countries.
32386435,It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung.
32386437,We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls.
32386473,The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples.
32386545,The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences).
32386898,However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data.
32387384,Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked.
32387564,The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.
32387617,SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility.
32387756,Although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.
32387794,Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) [1].
32388083,Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk while combating COVID-19 at the very frontline, and nosocomial outbreaks among HCWs are not unusual in similar settings; the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak led to over 966 HCW infections with 1.4% deaths in mainland China [2].
32388137,As of 11 February 2020, 3019 HCWs might have been infected with 2019-nCov in China, 1716 HCW cases were confirmed by nucleic acid testing[3], and at least 6 HCWs died, including the famous whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang.
32388138,In view of this severe situation, we are recommending urgent interventions to help to protect HCWs.
32388162,To describe the infection control preparedness measures undertaken for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus) in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on December 31, 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong.
32388417,A bundled approach of active and enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs) with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented.
32388469,Epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental samples, and air samples were collected and analyzed.
32388643,From day 1 to day 42, 42 of 1,275 patients (3.3%) fulfilling active (n = 29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n = 13) were confirmed to have the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32388698,The number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 of 13 confirmed cases (7.7%, day 22 to day 32) to 27 of 29 confirmed cases (93.1%, day 33 to day 42; P &lt; .001).
32388933,Among them, 28 patients (66.6%) came from 8 family clusters.
32388934,Of 413 HCWs caring for these confirmed cases, 11 (2.7%) had unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days.
32388948,None of these was infected, and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed.
32389195,Environmental surveillance was performed in the room of a patient with viral load of 3.3 × 106 copies/mL (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) and 5.9 × 106 copies/mL (saliva), respectively.
32389618,SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples (7.7%) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask.
32389849,Appropriate hospital infection control measures was able to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
32389891,An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019.
32390473,Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak.
32390691,After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed.
32390692,An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of <i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> .
32390786,In the first assumption, <i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> was assumed to maintain over 1.
32391022,The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with <i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1.
32391240,The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020.
32391308,In the second assumption, <i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (<i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (<i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention.
32391309,Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan.
32391409,The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393.
32391518,Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China.
32391519,Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce <i>R</i><sub> <i>t</i> </sub> to an ideal level and control the infection.
32391651,<b>Objective:</b> To describe the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of COVID-19 cases reported in Baodi district of Tianjin as of 18 February, 2020, which might be associated with the exposure in a local department store, and provide suggestions for prevention and control strategy development. <b>Methods:</b> The basic characteristics, time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store exposure were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases (53 cases) reported in Baodi district.
32391660,The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%).
32391661,The main clinical manifestations included fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%).
32391670,The proportion of confirmed severe cases was 32.50%.
32391746,The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred on 31 January, 2020.
32391908,Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 19(47.50%) were customers and 15(37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases).
32391912,The first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets.
32392125,The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. <b>Conclusion:</b> This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with the exposure in the department store.
32392331,By now, the current prevention and control measures have achieved satisfied effects. <b>目的：</b> 对截至2020年2月18日涉及天津市某百货大楼关联确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎病例流行病学特征进行描述性分析，为制定防控策略提供参考。

32395017,By 27 February 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively.
32395420,COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally.
32395541,Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).
32395550,Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days.
32395673,The basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS.
32396126,A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19.
32396455,Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem.
32396516,A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.
32396601,Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS.
32396710,We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions.
32396877,This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID-19 and enhance our control measures in the future.
32397008,A woman with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in her 35th week of pregnancy delivered an infant by cesarean section in a negative-pressure operating room.
32397011,The infant was negative for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2.
32397138,This case suggests that mother-to-child transmission is unlikely for this virus.
32397487,In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries).
32397515,The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020).
32397688,It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category.
32397697,COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate.
32397698,Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers.
32397699,Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation.
32398137,To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.
32398162,In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, began in Wuhan, China (1).
32398322,The disease spread widely in China, and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36 other countries and territories, including the United States.
32398569,Person-to-person transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have reported sustained person-to-person spread.
32398624,* On January 20, state and local health departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed from CDC, began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had close contact<sup>†</sup> with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2).
32399354,The aims of these efforts were to ensure rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further transmission, and better understand risk factors for transmission.
32399501,The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international significance.
32399507,There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management.
32400013,In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease.
32400044,Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades.
32400087,The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern.
32401085,There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock.
32401210,Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19.
32401226,Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age &gt;60 years (MuLBSTA score).
32401228,Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples.
32401360,Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation.
32401373,Role of steroids is still inconclusive.
32401931,Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed.
32401959,Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important.
32402910,Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended.
32403141,To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.
32403194,As of Feb 15, 2020, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China and across the world with more than 60,000 laboratory-confirmed cases.
32403261,Due to the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission during the viral incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV are both urgent and critical to global health.
32404302,In this article, we aim to highlight the necessity of implementing protective measures, and recommend how to set proper emergency management plans for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019-nCoV in dermatology departments.
32404416,COVID-19 is rapidly spreading.
32404436,Patients in incubation period and healthy carriers are possible sources for transmission.
32404623,However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identified due to the symptoms absent.
32404668,The research evidence is very lacking so far, although there are a few studies suggesting that presymptomatic or asymptomatic carrier may cause COVID-19 transmission.
32404711,Nearly half of the literature is in the state of preprint without peer review.
32405028,The question of &quot;the degree to which presymptomatic or asymptomatic infections can transmit&quot; is not fully understood.
32405103,There is an urgent need to screen infected carriers in larger close contacts or in the general population, and assess their risk for transmission.
32405115,新型冠状病毒肺炎正快速向人群传播，潜伏期患者和隐性感染者都有向体外排出病毒而成为传染源的可能，但是由于临床症状隐匿，这类传染源无法有效识别，容易形成防控措施的漏洞。
32405152,目前有研究提示该病潜伏期患者或隐性感染者可能造成疾病传播，但是研究仍然十分有限，而且近一半文献尚处于未经同行评审的预印本状态。
32405164,对于&quot;感染者能否在潜伏期传播病毒、无症状感染者是否可以传播病毒、效率如何&quot; ，尚无明确且公认的回答。
32405183,亟待在更大的密切接触者或者一般人群中筛选感染者，并且评估他们传播疾病的风险。.
32405236,2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has attracted the world's attention over the last month.
32405329,The Chinese government has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19).
32405641,However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility and still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such as whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to their infants.
32405905,Our research presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in China to better understand the transmission and diagnosis regarding this infectious disease.
32406084,The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.
32406140,Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.
32406305,Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.
32406395,Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
32406606,A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.
32406852,Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.
32407299,Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.
32407301,The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19.
32407303,This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state.
32407306,This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012.
32407507,While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death.
32407799,It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province.
32407826,Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32407893,Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident.
32408041,While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective.
32408119,Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy.
32408337,However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges.
32408338,The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally.
32408730,Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.
32408776,Motivated by the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic.
32408845,The model is calibrated based on internationally reported cases, and shows that at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers.
32408911,The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February.
32409192,Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.
32409243,Another animal to human transmission of a coronavirus occurred in December 2019 on a live animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan causing an epidemic in China, reaching now different continents.
32409328,This minireview summarizes the research literature on the virological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of this epidemic published until end of February 2020.
32409432,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012.
32410333,Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur.
32411271,Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths).
32411315,Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015.
32412064,MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures.
32412120,This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
32412403,To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.
32412415,We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports.
32412416,We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18).
32412512,In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.
32412918,Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9).
32413909,Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
32414076,The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period.
32414407,This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset.
32414708,The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.
32414996,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths.
32415348,SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine.
32415422,By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated.
32415519,By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths.
32415548,Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19.
32415723,COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread.
32415733,Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths.
32415753,Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.
32415918,Since the middle of December 2019, human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has occurred among close contacts.
32416146,At the same time, greater attention should be paid to psychological crisis intervention (PCI) among affected populations, for the timely prevention of inestimable damage from a secondary psychological crisis.
32416357,PCI has been initiated via remote (telephone and internet) and onsite medical services to help medical workers, patients, and others affected to overcome any psychological difficulties.
32416374,This paper outlines experiences based on the work of the Shanghai Medical Team.
32416534,As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions.
32416535,Travel-related cases were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current epidemic in Italy.
32417195,The month of February, however, has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local transmission the source of infections.
32417248,Contact tracing has failed to identify patient zero in one of the outbreaks.
32417675,As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of COVID-19 have died.
32417701,Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are identical at 2.3.
32417744,Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities.
32417768,It will be important to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.
32417802,The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
32418028,While most of the initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, person-to-person transmission has been verified.
32418146,Given that a vaccine cannot be developed and deployed for at least a year, preventing further transmission relies upon standard principles of containment, two of which are the isolation of known cases and the quarantine of persons believed at high risk of exposure.
32418213,This note presents probability models for assessing the effectiveness of case isolation and quarantine within a community during the initial phase of an outbreak with illustrations based on early observations from Wuhan.
32418216,Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission.
32418307,Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections.
32418481,This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.
32418559,Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community.
32418711,Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples.
32418804,Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed.
32419401,As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening.
32419544,Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization.
32419694,Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs.
32419769,The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization.
32419771,These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest.
32419887,None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died.
32420674,The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases).
32420863,Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32420953,Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization.
32421089,However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness.
32421494,These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests.
32421541,Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.
32421686,We report diagnosis and management of the first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized in Toronto, Canada.
32422057,No healthcare-associated transmission occurred.
32422180,In the face of a potential pandemic of COVID-19, we suggest sustainable and scalable control measures developed based on lessons learned from SARS.
32422201,The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020.
32422375,The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease.
32422545,The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team.
32422693,There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient).
32423283,The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache.
32423299,Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia.
32423338,Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients.
32423700,The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home.
32423996,COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases.
32424327,The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home.
32424329,Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease.
32425001,In the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease, investigating, classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease.
32425007,However, omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient.
32425244,To overcome these limitations, methods that can objectively verify the patient's claims (medical facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and closed-circuit television) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in South Korea.
32425279,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of a family clustering of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Field epidemiological survey was conducted. <b>Result:</b> Case 1 of the long-term residents from Hubei province was the source of infection of this family clustering.
32425485,There were 6 cases (from case 2 to case 7) infected in the whole incubation period.
32425486,The incubation period was more than 14 days for 3 of the second-generation cases.
32425489,Routes of transmission include respiratory droplets (from case 1 transmitted to case 6, from case 1 to her family members) and closecontact (from case 1 to other cases in her family).
32425491,All the age groups were generally susceptible, while elderly were easier to progress to critically ill.
32425637,Besides respiratory symptoms, there were also gastrointestinal symptoms, of which diarrhea was the most common one. <b>Conclusion:</b> Family clustering had been an important part for COVID-19 cases. <b>目的：</b> 通过对1起家庭聚集性新型冠状病毒肺炎8例病例的流行病学调查分析，探讨流行病学特征，为新型冠状病毒肺炎的防控提供依据。
32425658,<b>方法：</b> 采用描述性流行病学方法开展调查。
32425663,<b>结果：</b> 经调查来京湖北籍长居人员病例1为此次聚集病例的传染源，在整个潜伏期内共传染二代病例6人（病例2至病例7）。
32425714,出现三代疑似病例1例。
32426020,二代病例中有3例在暴露14 d后发病。
32426285,指示病例1传染到二代病例6的途径为近距离的呼吸道飞沫传播，指示病例1传染到家庭二代病例的途径包括呼吸道飞沫传播和密切接触传播两种方式。
32426529,青年、中年、老年等年龄段的人群普遍易感。
32426755,症状方面，老年人群病情较重，青年人群症状较轻。
32427171,除了呼吸道症状，腹泻等消化道症状、乏力肌肉酸痛头痛等其他症状也不容忽视。
32427202,<b>结论：</b> 家庭聚集性发病是新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控的重点。.
32427205,Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.
32427227,Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32427569,This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.
32427744,Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020.
32428031,Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.
32428085,Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.
32428112,All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.
32428286,Seven patients presented with a fever.
32428372,Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.
32428385,Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.
32429450,Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L).
32429786,Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.
32430840,None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020.
32430957,Nine livebirths were recorded.
32430964,No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.
32431085,All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10.
32431118,Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.
32431273,The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32431756,Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.
32432015,Hubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.
32432787,Network analysis to examine infectious contact relations provides an important means to uncover the topologies of individual infectious contact networks.
32432804,This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea.
32433010,We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment.
32433226,The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary.
32433285,Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths.
32433293,In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease.
32433343,Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.
32433799,The newly identified 2019-nCoV, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China, is spreading rapidly nationwide.
32433907,A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded.
32434058,However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates.
32434145,The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32434289,Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases.
32434337,In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea.
32434402,Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins.
32434615,Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90.
32434888,Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed.
32436578,Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition.
32436867,Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results.
32437017,Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death.
32437316,However, vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed.
32437338,Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in China.
32437432,Two cases of neonates with positive 2019-nCoV tests have been reported.
32437513,Due to the immature immune system and the possibility of vertical transmission from mother to infant, neonates have become a high-risk group susceptible to 2019-nCoV, which emphasize a close cooperation from both perinatal and neonatal pediatrics.
32437665,In neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), to prevent and control infection, there should be practical measures to ensure the optimal management of children potentially to be infected.
32437797,According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Chinese Neonatal 2019-nCoV expert working Group has put forward measures on the prevention and control of neonatal 2019-nCoV infection.
32437822,The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries.
32437930,Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries.
32437933,This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them.
32438328,More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms.
32438622,Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed.
32438824,Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR.
32438868,This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus.
32438898,The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars.
32439237,Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours.
32440660,We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine.
32441209,Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.
32441332,Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely.
32441360,We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic.
32442035,The EU/EEA is moving towards the 'limited sustained transmission' phase.
32442131,We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.
32442210,There's an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020.
32442265,Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events.
32442333,The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract.
32442427,Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages.
32442720,The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens.
32443022,Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates.
32443023,However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics.
32444358,Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.
32444569,Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32444876,The new decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (2020) started with the emergence of novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 that caused an epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.
32445134,It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans.
32445330,The source of origin, transmission to humans and mechanisms associated with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear yet, however, its resemblance with SARS-CoV and several other bat coronaviruses was recently confirmed through genome sequencing related studies.
32445421,The development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemics and cure infected people.
32445710,In this Review, we summarize current information about the emergence, origin, diversity, and epidemiology of three pathogenic coronaviruses with a specific focus on the current outbreak in Wuhan, China.
32445875,Furthermore, we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
32445904,In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and now has spread in many countries.
32446187,Pregnant women are susceptible population of COVID-19 which are more likely to have complications and even progresse to severe illness.
32446285,We report a case of neonatal COVID-19 infection in China with pharyngeal swabs tested positive by rRT-PCR assay 36 hours after birth.
32446538,However, whether the case is a vertical transmission from mother to child remains to be confirmed.
32446866,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been designated a public health emergency of international concern.
32447007,To prepare for a pandemic, hospitals need a strategy to manage their space, staff, and supplies so that optimum care is provided to patients.
32447742,In addition, infection prevention measures need to be implemented to reduce in-hospital transmission.
32447746,In the operating room, these preparations involve multiple stakeholders and can present a significant challenge.
32447777,Here, we describe the outbreak response measures of the anesthetic department staffing the largest (1,700-bed) academic tertiary level acute care hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital) and a smaller regional hospital (Sengkang General Hospital).
32447820,These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management.
32449022,Simulation was valuable in evaluating the feasibility of new operating room set-ups or workflow.
32449614,We also discuss how the hierarchy of controls can be used as a framework to plan the necessary measures during each phase of a pandemic, and review the evidence for the measures taken.
32449789,These containment measures are necessary to optimize the quality of care provided to COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of viral transmission to other patients or healthcare workers.
32449851,To determine possible modes of virus transmission, we investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases associated with a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China.
32450712,Data indicated that indirect transmission of the causative virus occurred, perhaps resulting from virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space, or spread from asymptomatic infected persons.
32450770,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 135 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical and epidemiological data of 135 cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin were collected, and the data were analyzed with descriptive method.
32451268,The factors influencing the severity of the illness were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 135 COVID-19 cases, 72 were males and 63 were females, the age of the cases was (48.62±16.83) years, and the case fatality rate was 2.22%.
32451366,Local transmission caused 74.81% of the cases.
32452050,A total of 33 clusters occurred, involving 85.92% of all COVID-19 cases.
32452195,The median of the incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.50 days, the average generation interval was 5 days, and the household secondary transmission rate was 20.46%.
32452539,Fever was the main symptom (78.63%), followed by cough (56.48%).
32452648,Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age (<i>OR</i>=1.038, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.010-1.167) and the number of chronic underlying diseases (<i>OR</i>=1.709, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.052-2.777) were the risk factors of severe illness. <b>Conclusions:</b> Fever was the main symptom at the early phase of COVID-19 in Tianjin, and the local cluster cases accounted for high proportion in confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Tianjin.
32452739,Severe illness was prone to occur in people with old age and multi underlying diseases.
32452819,Strict isolation of close contacts and intensive care of high-risk groups are the main measures to reduce the morbidity and case fatality of COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 探讨天津市135例新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）确诊病例临床及流行病学特征。
32452954,<b>方法：</b> 收集天津市135例COVID-19确诊病例的临床及流行病学资料，对数据进行描述性分析，并对病情严重程度影响因素进行分析。
32452978,<b>结果：</b> 135例病例中，男性72例，女性63例，年龄（48.62±16.83）岁，病死率为2.22%。
32453656,74.81%的病例感染来源为本地传播。
32453686,共发生33起聚集性疫情，涉及的病例占全部病例的85.92%。
32454253,疾病的中位潜伏期为6.50 d，代间距平均为5.00 d，家庭内续发率为20.46%。
32454456,发热的病例占比78.63%，其次为咳嗽56.48%；多因素回归分析显示年龄（<i>OR</i>＝1.038，95%<i>CI</i>：1.010～1.167）、慢性基础性疾病病种数（<i>OR</i>＝1.709，95%<i>CI</i>：1.052～2.777）是重症的危险因素。
32454574,<b>结论：</b> 天津市COVID-19病例早期以发热为主，本地聚集性疫情为确诊病例的主要构成，高年龄、有多种基础性疾病的人群容易转为重症，对密切接触者严格隔离及加强高危人群的救治是降低发病率和病死率的主要措施。.
32454575,Mass gathering (MG) medicine emerged against the backdrop of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries.
32454806,However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens.
32454807,The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics.
32455057,Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation.
32455859,It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics.
32456346,Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics.
32456560,As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.
32456959,COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were continued.
32458289,On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32458598,Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly.
32458712,On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources.
32458787,However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel.
32459061,On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19.
32459123,Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.
32459186,The COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus has been spreading rapidly since its onset in Wuhan, the capital city of central China's Hubei Province, in December 2019.
32459668,It is highly communicable through human-to-human transmission.
32460229,China has been making unprecedented efforts in treating the confirmed cases, identifying and isolating their close contacts and suspected cases to control the source of infection and cut the route of transmission.
32460383,China's devotion in handling this epidemic has effectively and efficiently curbed communication domestically and across the border.
32461062,Representative measures adopted by Wenzhou, the worst hit city out of Hubei Province, are examined to elucidate those massive undertakings with the aim of enhancing international understanding and building global rapport in fighting this evolving epidemic situation.
32461068,Despite multiple importations resulting in local chains of transmission, Singapore has been able to control the COVID-19 outbreak without major disruption to daily living.
32461231,In this article, we describe the combination of measures taken by Singapore to contain COVID-19 and share some early lessons learnt from the experience.
32462098,To determine the epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a remote region of China, far from Wuhan, we analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Gansu Province.
32462468,From January 23 through February 3, 2020, a total of 35 (64.8%) of 54 reported cases were imported from COVID-19-epidemic areas.
32462701,Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of transportation.
32462705,Time from infection to illness onset for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization.
32463076,Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers in Gansu Province.
32464297,As a result of adequate interventions, transmission of the COVID-19 virus in Gansu Province is decreasing.
32464409,An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.
32464670,On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.
32466392,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.
32468014,As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.
32468343,Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.
32468509,The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.
32470088,Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.
32470888,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
32471203,The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.
32471302,Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.
32471829,In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.
32471856,An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020.
32472043,Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.
32472347,Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020.
32472408,We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.
32472679,We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020.
32472685,Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.
32472745,To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.
32472897,The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020.
32472936,We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.
32472939,We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15-4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41-2·39) 1 week after.
32472974,Based on our estimates of R<sub>t</sub>, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.
32472991,Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.
32473015,As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.
32473049,Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.
32473082,Cases of 2019-nCoV are now being reported in different regions around the globe, concerning for a possible SARS like epidemic that infected for than 8000 people in 2002-03.
32473161,Though, major health authorities are still working on understanding the virus and its transmission, here we present a brief report regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak and what is known so far.
NA,Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide.
NA,Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern.
NA,The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia.
NA,Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible.
NA,The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement.
NA,Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases.
NA,Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19.
NA,To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.
NA,Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Recently, some global cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia have been caused by second- or third-generation transmission of the viral infection, resulting in no traceable epidemiological history.
NA,Owing to the complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, the first symptom and imaging features of patients can be very atypical and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections remains a challenge.
NA,It would aid radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the early atypical symptom and imaging features of the disease and contribute to the prevention of infected patients being missed.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in January 2020, and proposed management strategies for patients with gynecological tumors under risk of COVID19. <b>Results:</b> Three patients were treated COVID19 based on the national diagnosis and treatment protocol as well as research progress.
NA,Meanwhile, these patients were appropriately adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for gynecological tumors.
NA,Pneumonia was cured in 2 patients, and one patient died of COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with gynecological malignant tumors are high-risk groups prone to COVID-19 infection, and gynecological oncologists need to carry out education, prevention, control and treatment according to specific conditions.
NA,While actively preventing and controlling COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological malignant tumors should be carried out in an orderly and safe manner. <b>目的：</b> 在新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID-19)暴发和传播期间，探讨妇科恶性肿瘤患者的管理策略。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 对2020年1月武汉大学人民医院3例妇科恶性肿瘤伴发新型冠状病毒肺炎患者临床特点、处理方案和疾病转归进行回顾性分析，提出新型冠状病毒肺炎流行期间妇科恶性肿瘤患者的管理策略。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 3例患者在按照国家颁布的COVID-19诊治方案及研究进展给予针对性治疗的前提下，依照妇科肿瘤临床指南适当调整了治疗方案，对肿瘤进行了个性化的治疗。
NA,2例患者新型冠状病毒肺炎治愈，1例患者死于新型冠状病毒肺炎。
NA,<b>结论：</b> 妇科恶性肿瘤患者是感染COVID-19的高危人群，妇科肿瘤医师需根据具体情况做好宣教、防控及治疗等工作。
NA,在积极防控新型冠状病毒肺炎的同时，有序安全地开展妇科恶性肿瘤患者的诊治。.
NA,A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and 4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020).
NA,The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020.
NA,Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data.
NA,The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters.
NA,Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021.
NA,Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions.
NA,While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained.
NA,Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.
NA,The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019.
NA,In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.
NA,Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
NA,Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date.
NA,Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure.
NA,Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested.
NA,Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from China in mid-January, 2020.
NA,One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife.
NA,He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel.
NA,Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2.
NA,These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.
NA,Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.
NA,None.
NA,Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs.
NA,Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate.
NA,Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains.
NA,Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans.
NA,Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks, first in the Wuhan region of China and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency.
NA,Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution.
NA,Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro.
NA,Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells.
NA,This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.
NA,To identify the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of pediatric patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.
NA,Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included.
NA,The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis.
NA,Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates.
NA,There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases.
NA,The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2-13 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys.
NA,More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases.
NA,The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0-42 days).
NA,There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease.
NA,The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time.
NA,More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province.
NA,Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference.
NA,Although clinical manifestations of children's COVID-19 cases were generally less severe than those of adult patients, young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection.
NA,The distribution of children's COVID-19 cases varied with time and space, and most of the cases were concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas.
NA,Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence of human-to-human transmission.
NA,Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease.
NA,Here we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.
NA,We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to 23 January 2020 travel restrictions.
NA,Per person, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of documented infections ([46%-62%]), yet, due to their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
NA,These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.
NA,Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 in the UK has now been confirmed.
NA,There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronavirus during pregnancy.
NA,In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appeared higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women.
NA,We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy.
NA,Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy.
NA,Data were extracted from relevant papers.
NA,This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking.
NA,From 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 23 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified.
NA,From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
NA,No maternal deaths have been reported to date.
NA,Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm.
NA,There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death.
NA,In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery.
NA,Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively.
NA,SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester.
NA,Serious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care.
NA,Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition.
NA,Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized.
NA,Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies.
NA,We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19.
NA,The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem.
NA,Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death.
NA,This communication reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes.
NA,In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus.
NA,This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths.
NA,Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses.
NA,All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.
NA,Analysis of additional cases is necessary to determine if this remains true.
NA,Recent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei.
NA,To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China.
NA,Retrospective case series. 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.
NA,Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020.
NA,Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
NA,The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%.
NA,In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission.
NA,In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple.
NA,The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%).
NA,The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days.
NA,According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.
NA,Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.
NA,We presented two cases of COVID-19 associated SARS-CoV-2 infection during third trimester of pregnancy.
NA,Both mothers and newborns had excellent outcomes.
NA,We failed to identify SARS-CoV-2 in all the products of conception and the newborns.
NA,This report provided evidence of low risk of intrauterine infection by vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019.
NA,As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths.
NA,The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
NA,A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley.
NA,In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
NA,The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
NA,All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.
NA,Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%).
NA,The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars.
NA,Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control.
NA,Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed.
NA,Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea.
NA,Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission.
NA,To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.
NA,There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.
NA,Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.
NA,A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causes a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.
NA,It spread rapidly and globally.
NA,CT imaging is helpful for the evaluation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.
NA,Infection control inside the CT suites is also important to prevent hospital-related transmission of COVID-19.
NA,We present our experience with infection control protocol for COVID-19 inside the CT suites.
NA,Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious diseases.
NA,Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases imported into China every year.
NA,If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
NA,Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.
NA,This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019年底以来, 一种新型冠状病毒病肺炎 (COVID-19) 在我国大范围流行, 不仅严重威胁人民群众的生命安全和身体健康, 同时也给其他传染病防控带来了严峻挑战。

NA,本文分析新型冠状病毒肺炎流行对我国消除疟疾工作的挑战, 并探讨相应的应对策略和措施, 从而为医务工作者提供参考。.
NA,It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will continue to spread.
NA,Although we still have limited information on the epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages.
NA,Although SSEs appear to be difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs.
NA,To prevent and control of SSEs, speed is essential.
NA,Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends, first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events, particularly within healthcare settings.
NA,Better understanding transmission dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings, strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
NA,The pathogen in these cases is a new type of coronavirus.
NA,The World Health Organization confirmed this diagnosis and named the pathogen SARSCoV-2.
NA,The disease caused by SARSCoV-2 is called Corona Virus Disease (COVID-2019).
NA,The virus is highly infectious and pathogenic, causing human-to-human transmission.
NA,At present, SARSCoV-2 is still rampant in the world.
NA,Zhengzhou City in Henan Province serves as an example, 102 people have been confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV-2 (at 24:00 on February 5th, 2020), including three children, the youngest is 4 years old.
NA,From the perspective of clinical pediatricians as the first line fighting the epidemic, this paper will discuss the clinical characteristics, prevention and control measures, outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric cases.
NA,To assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings or crowded areas and to predict the spread of COVID-19 infections in Japan, we developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model with an additional modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas.
NA,The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed.
NA,Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area.
NA,The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there.
NA,The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly.
NA,This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone.
NA,On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours.
NA,In conclusions The infection spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency.
NA,Here we highlight nine most important research questions concerning virus transmission, asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, origin of virus and viral pathogenesis.
NA,An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020.
NA,Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak.
NA,Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7).
NA,Our findings suggest that <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control.
NA,Most recent estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.
NA,We estimate the distribution of serial intervals for 468 confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus disease reported in China as of February 8, 2020.
NA,The mean interval was 3.96 days (95% CI 3.53-4.39 days), SD 4.75 days (95% CI 4.46-5.07 days); 12.6% of case reports indicated presymptomatic transmission.
NA,Viral infectivity depends on interactions between components of the host cell plasma membrane and the virus envelope.
NA,Here we review strategies that could help stem the advance of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic.
NA,We focus on the role of lipid structures, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol, involved in the process, mediated by endocytosis, by which viruses attach to and infect cells.
NA,Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances, such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells.
NA,Certain molecules prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells.
NA,More research into these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis for new antiviral strategies.
NA,Pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV infection has been reported in Wuhan since December 2019, and spread rapidly across the country.
NA,The radical operation of colorectal cancer is semi-elective operation.
NA,Patients with colorectal cancer should receive operation as soon as possible after elective operation is resumed in each hospital. 2019-nCoV virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic infectors, and it has been confirmed to be transmitted by droplets and contact.
NA,However, fecal-oral transmission and aerosol transmission have not been excluded.
NA,Based on our experience with laparoscopic colorectal operation, we propose some surgery strategies for colorectal cancer patients under the corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) situation: the screening process should be strictly carried out before surgery to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection in the later stage; laparoscopic-assisted surgery is recommended for radical surgery for patients with colorectal cancer; strict aerosol management must be made during the operation; natural orifice specimen extraction surgery and transanal total mesorectal excision are should be performed prudently; scientific and reasonable prophylactic stoma should be done; personnel protection in surgical ward and operation room must be strengthened.
NA,自2019年12月以来，新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）在武汉暴发，并迅速向全国蔓延。
NA,新冠肺炎病毒可经由无症状感染者传播，并已被证实可经飞沫传播与接触传播，但粪口传播和气溶胶传播尚未除外。
NA,结直肠癌患者根治性手术属限期性手术，笔者根据本中心近期开展腹腔镜结直肠癌手术的经验，提出在新冠肺炎疫情条件下结直肠癌患者的手术策略。
NA,包括术前严格执行筛选流程、以减少后期院内传染风险；推荐对结直肠癌患者根治性手术采用腹腔镜辅助手术的方式进行治疗；严格进行术中气溶胶管理；慎重开展经自然腔道取标本手术和经肛全直肠系膜切除术；科学、合理进行预防性造口和严格切实加强病房及手术室人员防护。.
NA,Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.
NA,We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases.
NA,We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined.
NA,Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded.
NA,The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3-6).
NA,The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.
NA,Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.
NA,None.
NA,We report a familial cluster of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to evidence that a potential transmission of the COVID-19 during the incubation period.
NA,The first patient in this familial cluster was identified in presymptomatic period, as a close contact of a confirmed patient.
NA,Five family members had close contact with the first patient during his incubation period, four of them were confirmed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the subsequent sampling test.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019, named COVID-19 officially by the World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) on February 12, 2020, has spread at unprecedented speed.
NA,After the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, Chinese anesthesiologists encountered increasing numbers of infected patients since December 2019.
NA,Because the main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets and close contact, anesthesia providers are at a high risk when responding to the devastating mass emergency.
NA,So far, actions have been taken including but not limited to nationwide actions and online education regarding special procedures of airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic management, sedation, and analgesia.
NA,As the epidemic situation has lasted for months (thus far), special platforms have also been set up to provide free mental health care to all anesthesia providers participating in acute and critical caring for COVID-19 patients.
NA,The current article documents the actions taken, lesson learned, and future work needed.
NA,Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 cases of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from patients outside of Wuhan were reviewed.
NA,The human-to-human transmission of the virus may explain the infection of the disease outside of Wuhan.
NA,CT examination is important in the early detection and follow-up of the disease.
NA,With a history of exposure or travelling, symptoms of fever and cough, and the typical CT manifestation such as ground-glass opacity with a peripheral distribution, we should also think of the possibility of the COVID-19 pneumonia in patients outside of Wuhan.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the main means of transmission.
NA,Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide.
NA,Up to now, according to official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually being controlled.
NA,Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications.
NA,The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains unclear.
NA,Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no specific antiviral drug against the virus.
NA,This article reviews the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.
NA,The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate regions.
NA,Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months.
NA,The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years.
NA,The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior.
NA,Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates.
NA,More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract.
NA,Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections.
NA,We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.
NA,Expected final online publication date for the <i>Annual Review of Virology</i>, Volume 7 is September 29, 2020.
NA,Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
NA,To provide clinical management guidelines for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in pregnancy.
NA,On February 5, 2020, a multidisciplinary teleconference comprising Chinese physicians and researchers was held and medical management strategies of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy were discussed.
NA,Ten key recommendations were provided for the management of COVID-19 infections in pregnancy.
NA,Currently, there is no clear evidence regarding optimal delivery timing, the safety of vaginal delivery, or whether cesarean delivery prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery; therefore, route of delivery and delivery timing should be individualized based on obstetrical indications and maternal-fetal status.
NA,Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020.
NA,To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.
NA,The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources.
NA,By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.
NA,We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6).
NA,In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19.
NA,The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.
NA,Our results indicate an early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic viral infection originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019.
NA,The World Health Organization has classified this pandemic as a global health emergency due to its virulent nature of transmission, which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,Singapore's health ministry has responded with enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 for all suspected pneumonia cases, further increasing the volume of testing via real-time reverse transcription PCR, as well as samples necessitating stringent infectious control.
NA,Collectively, this has implications on the total testing process, laboratory operations and its personnel due to biosafety concerns.
NA,Turnaround time for routine testing may also be affected.
NA,The aim of this article is to present our tertiary institution's early experience with managing this emerging crisis and offer practical considerations for the preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical phases of laboratory testing in this cohort of patients.
NA,Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major healthcare threat.
NA,Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity.
NA,False negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission.
NA,We here aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19.
NA,The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 including IgA, IgM and IgG response were examined by using an ELISA based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein.
NA,Total 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but had typical manifestation).
NA,The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort.
NA,The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection were 5 days (IQR 3-6), while IgG was detected on 14 days (IQR 10-18) after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7% and 77.9% respectively.
NA,In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively.
NA,The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR method after 5.5 days of symptom onset.
NA,The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combined IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compare with a single qPCR test (51.9%).
NA,Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid to the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.
NA,The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen and is threatening the global health.
NA,Strikingly, more than 28 000 cases and 550 deaths have been reported within two months from disease emergence.
NA,Armed with experience from previous epidemics in the last two decades, clinicians, scientists, officials, and citizens in China are all contributing to the prevention of further 2019-nCoV transmission.
NA,Efficient preliminary work has enabled us to understand the basic characteristics of 2019-nCoV, but there are still many unanswered questions.
NA,It is too early now to judge our performance in this outbreak.
NA,Continuous and strengthened efforts should be made not only during the epidemic, but also afterwards in order to prepare for any incoming challenges.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia pandemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats.
NA,However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts.
NA,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon.
NA,This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is spreading across all continents.
NA,Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death.
NA,Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited.
NA,The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population.
NA,There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission.
NA,Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described.
NA,Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women.
NA,In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women.
NA,These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women.
NA,Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.
NA,As the infection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is quickly developing into a global pneumonia epidemic, the careful analysis of its transmission and cellular mechanisms is sorely needed.
NA,In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1.
NA,However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions.
NA,Next, using metagenomic samples from <i>Manis javanica</i>, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome.
NA,In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the <i>Manis</i> coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.
NA,The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients.
NA,First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death.
NA,Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism.
NA,Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects.
NA,Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions.
NA,Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become host or vectors of virus transmission.
NA,We hereby review the peer-reviewed and preprint literature pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care workers, and health systems.
NA,:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised urgent questions about containment and mitigation, particularly in countries where the virus has not yet established human-to-human transmission.
NA,The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?
NA,&quot; :These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission.
NA,While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. :It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms.
NA,In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R00) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent.
NA,In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community.
NA,Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer.
NA,Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden.
NA,Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus.
NA,As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people.
NA,Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.
NA,A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020.
NA,The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters.
NA,The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare.
NA,Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia.
NA,Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare.
NA,Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce.
NA,Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults.
NA,Deaths were extremely rare.
NA,On 30 January 2020, WHO declared coronavirus (COVID-19) a global public health emergency.
NA,As of 12 March 2020, 125 048 confirmed COVID-19 cases in 118 countries had been reported.
NA,On 12 March 2020, the first case in the Pacific islands was reported in French Polynesia; no other Pacific island country or territory has reported cases.
NA,The purpose of our analysis is to show how travellers may introduce COVID-19 into the Pacific islands and discuss the role robust health systems play in protecting health and reducing transmission risk.
NA,We analyse travel and Global Health Security Index data using a scoring tool to produce quantitative estimates of COVID-19 importation risk, by departing and arriving country.
NA,Our analysis indicates that, as of 12 March 2020, the highest risk air routes by which COVID-19 may be imported into the Pacific islands are from east Asian countries (specifically, China, Korea and Japan) to north Pacific airports (likely Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or, to a less extent, Palau); or from China, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America or France to south Pacific ports (likely, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesia or New Caledonia).
NA,Other importation routes include from other east Asian countries to Guam, and from Australia, New Zealand and other European countries to the south Pacific.
NA,The tool provides a useful method for assessing COVID-19 importation risk and may be useful in other settings.
NA,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and the disease this agent may induce, are a cause of notable concern for the general population and, of course, among our professionals and patients.
NA,Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a high-risk diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the case of upper GI examinations, and a moderate to low-risk intervention when involving lower GI explorations.
NA,The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of patients infected with the virus, and occasionally in colonic biopsy samples, has been consistently documented.
NA,In fact, viral elimination in the feces may be more prolonged than viral identification in respiratory tract secretions.
NA,Furthermore, viral transmission may occur in asymptomatic individuals.
NA,However, as of this moment no information has been reported on the possibility of viral transmission, even to professionals, via this route.
NA,WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.
NA,Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.
NA,The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally.
NA,Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges.
NA,Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.
NA,ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre.
NA,Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.
NA,ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.
NA,We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.
NA,Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan's 2003 SARS outbreak.
NA,TCB's success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals.
NA,Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease.
NA,These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days.
NA,Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations.
NA,In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector - the quarantine ward.
NA,This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis.
NA,A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB.
NA,Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals.
NA,These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community.
NA,Evidencing eTCB effectiveness is Taiwan's success to date in containing and controlling the community-hospital-community transmission cycle.
NA,Lianhuaqingwen (LH) as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula has been used to treat influenza and exerted broad-spectrum antiviral effects on a series of influenza viruses and immune regulatory effects [1].
NA,The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response.
NA,The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay.
NA,The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope.
NA,Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
NA,LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
NA,Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells.
NA,LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro.
NA,These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.
NA,Rapid virological diagnosis is needed to limit the length of isolation for suspected COVID-19 cases.
NA,We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France.
NA,Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples.
NA,Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected.
NA,Results were obtained within approximately 3 h of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory.
NA,Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63.
NA,Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission.
NA,Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation.
NA,Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection exported from mainland China could lead to self-sustained outbreaks in other countries.
NA,By February 2020, several countries were reporting imported SARS-CoV-2 cases.
NA,To contain the virus, early detection of imported SARS-CoV-2 cases is critical.
NA,We used air travel volume estimates from Wuhan, China, to international destinations and a generalized linear regression model to identify locations that could have undetected imported cases.
NA,Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from other locations as the virus spreads and more information on importations and transmission becomes available.
NA,Early detection and appropriate control measures can reduce the risk for transmission in all locations.
NA,The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, travel, and commerce.
NA,This overview analyzes the best information from the early research, including epidemiologic and demographic features from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV viruses; lessons learned from the experience of an emergency physician in Northern Italy, where the outbreak has devastated the healthcare system; evidence on transmission and prevention through safe use of PPE; evidence and advice on SARS-CoV-2 testing and co-infection; management options; airway management options; steps for rapid sequence intubation in the ED and managing disaster ventilation; and information on managing pediatric and pregnant patients.
NA,This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics.
NA,All the children were detected positive result after their families onset.
NA,Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom.
NA,Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%).
NA,Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia.
NA,There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging.
NA,The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%).
NA,Five discharged children were admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR.
NA,COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult.
NA,However, their PCR result in stool showed longer time than their families.
NA,Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff.
NA,Data concerning the transmission of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in paucisymptomatic patients are lacking.
NA,We report an Italian paucisymptomatic case of coronavirus disease 2019 with multiple biological samples positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This case was detected using the World Health Organization protocol on cases and contact investigation.
NA,Current discharge criteria and the impact of extra-pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 samples are discussed.
NA,Cases of a novel coronavirus were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and have since spread across the world.
NA,Epidemiological studies have indicated human-to-human transmission in China and elsewhere.
NA,To aid the analysis and tracking of the COVID-19 epidemic we collected and curated individual-level data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online reports.
NA,All data are geo-coded and, where available, include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history.
NA,The generation of detailed, real-time, and robust data for emerging disease outbreaks is important and can help to generate robust evidence that will support and inform public health decision making.
NA,Due to the nature of their profession, health care personnel (HCP) have always been easy targets for transmission of communicable diseases like COVID-19.
NA,Shielding HCPs is of consequential significance in ensuring continued health care for the whole population in addition to reducing further spread.
NA,Close contact, repeated contact and prolonged contact are unavoidable in the intensive care (IC) environment.
NA,It is not uncommon for IC-HCPs to get carried away during an emergent situation, such as that posed by a suddenly deteriorating patient, and forgo the protective barriers that protect them from contracting a communicable infection.
NA,Some notable precautionary measures are mentioned below.
NA,This is by no means an exhaustive list.
NA,Many human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoonotic event.
NA,Some of the diseases caused by these zoonotic events have affected millions of people around the world, some of which have resulted in high rates of morbidity/mortality in humans.
NA,Changes in the viral proteins that function as ligands of the host receptor may promote the spillover between species.
NA,The most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the Covid-19 epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission.
NA,An <i>in silico</i> approach was performed, and changes were detected in the S1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike.
NA,The observed changes have significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the Bat-CoV to this receptor.
NA,The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2.
NA,This could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) epidemic has spread to virtually every continent in the world.
NA,Despite Singapore's efforts, sustained community transmission of the virus has continued.
NA,We herein describe several key experiences and lessons learnt during the early course of the outbreak.
NA,First, it is critical to evaluate the outbreak objectively based on its own characteristics and not those of past epidemics.
NA,Second, the great advancements in speed and power of science and international collaboration have been critical in providing knowledge about the virus and disease.
NA,Third, public risk communications and the need to combat false information and rumours are even more crucial in this age of social media and viral information spread.
NA,Lastly, outbreak control and mitigation goes beyond the healthcare sector.
NA,The many lessons learnt will serve as a blueprint for dealing with future pandemics, but a sustainable new normal is required for the immediate future.
NA,The world must act fast to contain wider international spread of the epidemic of COVID-19 now.
NA,The unprecedented public health efforts in China have contained the spread of this new virus.
NA,Measures taken in China are currently proven to reduce human-to-human transmission successfully.
NA,We summarized the effective intervention and prevention measures in the fields of public health response, clinical management, and research development in China, which may provide vital lessons for the global response.
NA,It is really important to take collaborative actions now to save more lives from the pandemic of COVID-19.
NA,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread.
NA,In the operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients.
NA,In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce exposure to patients' respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.
NA,To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk.
NA,Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission.
NA,This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention.
NA,By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead to worldwide outbreaks.
NA,Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the perioperative management team.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the characteristics of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, and provide epidemiological evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> The data of all the cluster cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin reported as 22 February 2020 were collected to analyze the characteristics of different types of the clusters. <b>Results:</b> A total of 115 COVID-19 cases were reported in in 33 clusters in Tianjin.
NA,Clusters can be classified as following: 28 familial clusters (71 cases), 1 work place cluster (10 cases), 3 transport vehicle clusters (8 cases) and 1 public place cluster (26 cases).
NA,Fourteen familial clusters were caused by the cases from the working place or public place clusters.
NA,Numbers of secondary cases of family clusters were 1-7, the median number was 7.
NA,The interval from onset to diagnosis for the first case was longer than those of other cases in the familial clusters (Z=-2.406, <i>P</i>= 0.016).
NA,The median of incubation period of the public place clusters was 2 days.
NA,The intervals from onset to diagnosis were significant different among the family, working place and public place clusters (<i>H</i>=8.843, , <i>P</i>=0.012) , and there were also significant differences in onset time among the secondary cases (<i>H</i>=16.607, <i>P</i>=0.000) . <b>Conclusions:</b> In the surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic, special attention should be paid to the cases from same family, same work place, or other places where clustering are prone to occur, and the epidemiological investigation should be carried out timely to confirm the cluster.
NA,To prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the close contacts of the patients should be transferred to an assigned observation place in time for single room isolation.
NA,The awareness of COVID-19 prevention is low in some rural areas, reflected by many mass gathering activities and delayed medical care seeking after onset.
NA,It is necessary to strengthen the health education and take control measures in early period of epidemic. <b>目的：</b> 分析天津市新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）聚集性疫情病例情况，掌握不同类型聚集性病例发病特征，为COVID-19防控提供流行病学证据和经验。

NA,出现聚集性疫情的场所内部，应及时将密切接触者转至统一的隔离观察点，严格单间管理，避免疫情扩散。
NA,部分农村地区防疫意识不强，聚集活动较多，且发病后就诊不及时，在疫情初期应该加强防控的宣传和控制措施。.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the cases of COVID-19 epidemic clusters, and explore the influence of family factors and social factors such as group activities on the spread of the disease. <b>Methods:</b> The data of cases of COVID-19 epidemic clusters from 19 January, 2020 to 25 February, 2020 were collected from the official platforms of 36 cities in 6 provinces in China.
NA,Descriptive statistical methods, <i>χ</i>(2) test and curve fitting were used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of the clustered cases. <b>Results:</b> By 25 February, 2020, the data of 1 052 cases in 366 epidemic clusters were collected.
NA,In these clustered cases, 86.9%(914/1 050) occurred in families.
NA,Among the 1 046 cases with gender information, 513 were males (49.0%) and 533 were females (51.0%).
NA,The cases were mainly young adults between 18 and 59 years old, accounting for 68.5% (711/1 038).
NA,In the 366 epidemic clusters , the clusters in which the first confirmed cases with the history of sojourn in Wuhan or Hubei accounted for 47.0%(172/366).

NA,The median of interval between the first generation case onset and the second generation case onset was 5 (2-8) days.
NA,The median of onset- diagnosis interval of the initial cases was 6 (3-9) days, and the median of onset-diagnosis interval of the secondary cases was 5 (3-8) days. <b>Conclusions:</b> Epidemic clusters of COVID-19 were common in many cities outside Wuhan and Hubei.
NA,Close contact in family was one of the main causes for the spread of household transmission of the virus.
NA,After 4 February, the epidemic clusters were mainly caused by the first generation or second generation cases in local areas, and the time for diagnosis became shorter. <b>目的：</b> 了解新型冠状病毒肺炎聚集性病例的流行病学特征，探讨家庭因素以及集体活动等对本病传播的影响。

NA,Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore.
NA,We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.
NA,We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population.
NA,Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R<sub>0</sub>] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic.
NA,We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R<sub>0</sub> value.
NA,These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention).
NA,We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.
NA,For the baseline scenario, when R<sub>0</sub> was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5-8·5) of the resident population of Singapore.
NA,The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000-776 000) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8-20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1 249 000) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9-33·1) of the Singaporean population.
NA,Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6-99·9) when R<sub>0</sub> was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5-99·7) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 -94·4) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·5.
NA,Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R<sub>0</sub> of 1·5.
NA,Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore.
NA,However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work.
NA,At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.
NA,Singapore Ministry of Health, Singapore Population Health Improvement Centre.
NA,The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China.
NA,Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have been undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide.
NA,It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China.
NA,We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures.
NA,Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data.
NA,Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan.
NA,This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.
NA,As the world confronts coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an illness caused by yet another emerging pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), obstetric care providers are asking what this means for pregnant women.
NA,The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain.
NA,The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures.
NA,There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs.
NA,Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed.
NA,Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick.
NA,Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask.
NA,As the situation with COVID-19 rapidly unfolds, it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date.
NA,An estimated 30 million passengers are transported on 272 cruise ships worldwide each year* (1).
NA,Cruise ships bring diverse populations into proximity for many days, facilitating transmission of respiratory illness (2).
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread worldwide to at least 187 countries and territories.
NA,Widespread COVID-19 transmission on cruise ships has been reported as well (3).
NA,Passengers on certain cruise ship voyages might be aged ≥65 years, which places them at greater risk for severe consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (4).
NA,During February-March 2020, COVID-19 outbreaks associated with three cruise ship voyages have caused more than 800 laboratory-confirmed cases among passengers and crew, including 10 deaths.
NA,Transmission occurred across multiple voyages of several ships.
NA,This report describes public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on these ships.
NA,COVID-19 on cruise ships poses a risk for rapid spread of disease, causing outbreaks in a vulnerable population, and aggressive efforts are required to contain spread.
NA,All persons should defer all cruise travel worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,A physiological small animal model that resembles COVID-19 with low mortality is lacking.
NA,Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option.
NA,Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed.
NA,Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre.
NA,The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge.
NA,The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g.
NA,Challenged index hamsters consistently infected naïve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss.
NA,All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre ≥1:427 fourteen days post-challenge.
NA,Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology.
NA,No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.
NA,Besides satisfying the Koch's postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is currently causing a major pandemic.
NA,It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Betacoronavirus genus that also includes the SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
NA,While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, some patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
NA,Studies have identified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.
NA,These suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract.
NA,This has important implications to the disease management, transmission, and infection control.
NA,In this article, we review the important gastrointestinal aspects of the disease.
NA,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 - 2.5, indicating that 2 - 3 persons will be infected from an index patient.
NA,A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection.
NA,As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms.
NA,The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures.
NA,Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission.
NA,Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida.
NA,Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system.
NA,These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications.
NA,We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19.
NA,Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed.
NA,Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services.
NA,Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine.
NA,Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.
NA,We describe an evidence-based approach for optimization of infection control and operating room management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily but not exclusively contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization.
NA,Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C).
NA,(1) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the IV pole to the left of the provider.
NA,Double glove during induction.
NA,(2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag, on the IV pole to the right of the provider.
NA,Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (i.e. laryngoscope blades and handles) and close.
NA,Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas.
NA,After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol.
NA,Use a top down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden.
NA,Treat operating rooms using UV-C.
NA,(3) Decolonize patients using pre-procedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone iodine within one hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse.
NA,(4) Create a closed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection.
NA,(5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of ESKAPE transmission.
NA,(6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure, use relatively long (e.g., 12-hour) staff shifts.
NA,If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases, not 8 first case starts.
NA,(7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent.
NA,(8) Do not have patients go into a large, pooled phase I post-anesthesia care unit, because of the risk of contaminating facility at large along with many staff.
NA,Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery, like done routinely in Japan.
NA,These 8 programmatic recommendations stand on a substantial body of empirical evidence characterizing the epidemiology of perioperative transmission and infection development made possible by support from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF).
NA,The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2<sup>1</sup>.
NA,This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection<sup>2</sup>.
NA,Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the identity of any intermediate host that might have facilitated transfer to humans is unknown.
NA,Here, we report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China.
NA,Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain.
NA,The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.
NA,Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China.
NA,Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations.
NA,In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission.
NA,Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience.
NA,These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve 'zero infection' of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.
NA,Based on the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Edition 5), combined with our current clinical treatment experience, we recently proposed a revision of the first edition of &quot;Guidance for maternal and fetal management during pneumonia epidemics of novel coronavirus infection in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital&quot;.
NA,This article focused on the issues of greatest concern of pregnant women including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnostic criteria, inspection precautions, drug treatment options, indications and methods of termination of pregnancy, postpartum fever, breastfeeding considerations, mode of mother-to-child transmission, neonatal isolation and advice on neonatal nursing, to provide valuable experience for better management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and newborns.
NA,We reported several personal-oriented and mobile phone-based information technologies which were recently developed and widely used during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China.
NA,These technologies help reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and maintain normal social order.
NA,Since December 2019, a series of highly infectious cases of unexplained pneumonia have been discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which have been confirmed as '2019 corona virus disease' caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 virus can invade many human systems including the lungs.
NA,Patients with central nervous system involvement may show a series of neurological symptoms, which is easy to be misdiagnosed and neglected, thereby increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Hereditary ataxia is a large group of neurodegenerative diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and high mortality and disability.
NA,In view of the seriousness of the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the government have restricted the follow-up, diagnosis and treatment of patients by the hospitals, which has a great impact on their mental and physical health.
NA,In order to standardize the management of patients during the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, the Specialized Committee of Neurogenetics of the Neurophysician Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association has formulated this consensus, with an aim to help patients to overcome the difficulties and pass the epidemic prevention period safely.
NA,Few novel or emerging infectious diseases have posed such vital ethical challenges so quickly and dramatically as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern and recently classified COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic.
NA,As of this writing, the epidemic has not yet peaked in the United States, but community transmission is widespread.
NA,President Trump declared a national emergency as fifty governors declared state emergencies.
NA,In the coming weeks, hospitals will become overrun, stretched to their capacities.
NA,When the health system becomes stretched beyond capacity, how can we ethically allocate scarce health goods and services?
NA,How can we ensure that marginalized populations can access the care they need?
NA,What ethical duties do we owe to vulnerable people separated from their families and communities?
NA,And how do we ethically and legally balance public health with civil liberties?
NA,This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection.
NA,The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus.
NA,The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia.
NA,Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far.
NA,In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated.
NA,Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued.
NA,Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment.
NA,In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic.
NA,An outbreak of severe pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
NA,The infectious virus was soon identified and named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).
NA,The name of the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) was given by WHO on 11 February 2020.
NA,It has so far caused about 118 000 cases in 114 countries including China and was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March.
NA,We still face great challenges in control of the epidemic: uncertain initial source of infection, infected populations widely scattered, complex routs of transmission, populations generally susceptible, high contagiousness of the virus, and finally vaccines unlikely available in the near future.
NA,2019年12月湖北省武汉市报告的不明原因重症肺炎聚集性病例事件被确定为新型冠状病毒感染。
NA,WHO于2020年2月11日将该病命名为COVID-19。
NA,截至3月10日，新型冠状病毒肺炎已造成包括我国在内的114个国家和地区出现了11.8万病例；3月11日WHO评估认为，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情已呈现大流行特征。
NA,当前新型冠状病毒肺炎防控工作面临巨大挑战，主要是由于病原溯源困难、传染源分布广泛、传播途径多样、易感人群免疫水平较低、传染性较强和疫苗研发尚需时日等因素的影响。.
NA,Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally.
NA,Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.
NA,We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China.
NA,We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.
NA,From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).
NA,Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).
NA,Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5-38·5°C.
NA,Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).
NA,Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.
NA,All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir-ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.
NA,Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.
NA,By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.
NA,Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

NA,In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China.
NA,Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures.
NA,We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.
NA,To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community.
NA,Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures.
NA,We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases.
NA,We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April).
NA,Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively.
NA,There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond.
NA,However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.
NA,Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak.
NA,Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually.
NA,However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R<sub>0</sub> and the duration of infectiousness.

NA,There is little published evidence on the gastrointestinal features of COVID-19.
NA,To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission.
NA,We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak.
NA,With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73).
NA,Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis.
NA,Vomiting was more prominent in children.
NA,About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting.
NA,Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms.
NA,The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found.
NA,Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%).
NA,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces.
NA,Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection.
NA,In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive.
NA,Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days.
NA,Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID-19 patients are potentially infectious.
NA,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world.
NA,According to the World Health Organization statement on 13 March 2020, there had been over 132 500 confirmed cases globally.
NA,Nevertheless, the case reports of children are rare, which results in the lack of evidence for preventing and controlling of children's infection.
NA,Here, we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected children diagnosed from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin, China.
NA,All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after the treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, and 7 days after diagnosis, respectively.
NA,However, after been discharged, all three cases were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the stool samples within 10 days, in spite of their remained negative nucleic acid in throat swab specimens.
NA,Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for children cases.
NA,The current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus is a worldwide public health concern.
NA,To aboard this emergency, and like never before, scientific groups around the world have been working in a fast and coordinated way to get the maximum of information about this virus when it has been almost 3 months since the first cases were detected in Wuhan province in China.
NA,The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century.
NA,In this work, we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia.
NA,Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia.
NA,We also sub-classified the isolates into variants according to punctual mutations in the genome.
NA,Our work contributes to global information about transmission dynamics and the importance to take control measures to stop the spread of the infection.
NA,COVID-19 is placing considerable strain on healthcare systems.
NA,Disaster and military medicine specialists were involved in the outbreak in Italy, after many units were overwhelmed.
NA,Health providers were caught off guard and personnel was unprepared to face this unprecedented threat.
NA,Local decisions accelerated the rate of the spread.
NA,Many countries declared a state of emergency and lockdown to contain the exponential transmission of the disease.
NA,The purpose of this review is to suggest quick key points of strategies to implement in obstetric units without delay to respond to the oncoming wave, based on experience and feedback from the field.
NA,It is essential in an emergency situation to understand what is at stake and prepare maternity wards in the best possible way.
NA,The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is challenging international public health and healthcare efforts.
NA,As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important.
NA,Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses.
NA,Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events.
NA,While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness.
NA,History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators.
NA,The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor.
NA,Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face of an international outbreak.
NA,Colombia confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on March 6th, 2020.
NA,On March 16th, 2020, 54 cases have been confirmed (36 imported and 18 associated), therefore, Colombia is at highest alert, and it is now trying to avoid or minimize the last stage of &quot;community transmission&quot;.
NA,We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19.
NA,In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks.
NA,Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process.
NA,Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the stage of &quot;community transmission&quot; of COVID-19, through properly detection and management of possible cases and customer education.
NA,Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown.
NA,In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China.
NA,The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020.
NA,Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.
NA,28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male.
NA,Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0).
NA,Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%).
NA,8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission.
NA,The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%).
NA,The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%).
NA,15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%.
NA,If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037).
NA,Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010).
NA,Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.
NA,It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.
NA,The breakthrough of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, a city of China, has damaged the status of health and quality of life.
NA,In the sequel of this epidemic or contagious disease, the patient experiences fever, chest paint, chills, a rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, and kidney failure.
NA,It has been suggested that this disease can spread through human-to-human transmission or by super spreading.
NA,By the help of the non-invasive fluid &quot;saliva&quot;, it is easy to detect the virus.
NA,This can help with the comfort of the patient as well as healthcare personnel.
NA,Under this perspective, we discuss the epidemic situation of 2019-nCOV and its relationship with human saliva.
NA,A novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged and is rapidly spreading in humans<sup>1,2</sup>.
NA,A key to tackling this epidemic is to understand the virus's receptor recognition mechanism, which regulates its infectivity, pathogenesis and host range.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor - human ACE2 (hACE2)<sup>3,4</sup>.
NA,Here we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex with hACE2.
NA,Compared with the SARS-CoV RBD, a hACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD takes a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/hACE2 interface.
NA,These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhance its hACE2-binding affinity.
NA,Additionally, we show that RaTG13, a bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, also uses hACE2 as its receptor.
NA,The differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 in hACE2 recognition shed light on potential animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This study provides guidance for intervention strategies targeting receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported recently.
NA,However, as SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, we know little about it.
NA,In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the basic characteristics of the pathogen, the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus.
NA,Furthermore, we also review the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We highlight bats as the potential natural reservoir and pangolins as the possible intermediate host of the virus, but their roles are waiting for further investigation.
NA,Finally, the advances in the development of chemotherapeutic options are also briefly summarized.
NA,Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
NA,Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold.
NA,The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
NA,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
NA,HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
NA,Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
NA,The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
NA,Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
NA,Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
NA,In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
NA,Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
NA,The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
NA,In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted in China, Macau, Hong Kong, and other Asian and European counterparts.
NA,This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing attention nationwide.
NA,Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia.
NA,Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control.
NA,The National Health Commission of China has summoned a call for emergency psychological crisis intervention and thus, various mental health associations and organizations have established expert teams to compile guidelines and public health educational articles/videos for mental health professionals and the general public alongside with online mental health services.
NA,In addition, mental health professionals and expert groups are stationed in designated isolation hospitals to provide on-site services.
NA,Experts have reached a consensus on the admission of patients with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 outbreak in mental health institutions.
NA,Nevertheless, the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 has emerged to mount a serious challenge to the mental health service in China.
NA,Community transmission of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in the state of Washington in February 2020.
NA,We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records.
NA,The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020.
NA,Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up.
NA,We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19.
NA,The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission.
NA,The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus.
NA,All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation.
NA,Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors.
NA,No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses.
NA,Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission.
NA,Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.
NA,During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.
NA,Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.
NA,(Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).
NA,Almost half of the confirmed COVID-19 cases detected so far in the United Kingdom are part of a large cluster of 13 British nationals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, Spain, and France.
NA,Transmissions among this cluster occurred at a ski resort in France, and originated from a single infected traveller returning from a conference in Singapore where he acquired the virus.
NA,At least 21 individuals were exposed to the virus, tested, and quarantined, with 13 of those testing positive between the period of 6th February and 15th February.
NA,Here, all publicly available information about the primarily UK/France cluster is consolidated, providing a complete and accessible summary of the cases and their connections.
NA,Notable in this cluster are the number of individuals infected, the apparent absence of any severe illness among those infected, and a case of a “delayed positive” test during isolation after initially testing negative, at least 7 days after last possible contact.
NA,Because of its proximity to and frequent travelers to and from China, Taiwan faces complex challenges in preventing 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,As soon as China reported the unidentified outbreak to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, Taiwan assembled a taskforce and began health checks onboard flights from Wuhan.
NA,Taiwan's rapid implementation of disease prevention measures helped detect and isolate the country's first COVID-19 case on January 20, 2020.
NA,Laboratories in Taiwan developed 4-hour test kits and isolated 2 strains of the coronavirus before February.
NA,Taiwan effectively delayed and contained community transmission by leveraging experience from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, prevalent public awareness, a robust public health network, support from healthcare industries, cross-departmental collaborations, and advanced information technology capacity.
NA,We analyze use of the National Health Insurance database and critical policy decisions made by Taiwan's government during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,We report epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster.
NA,Our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings.
NA,These findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as CoV-19, is an RNA virus which can cause severe acute respiratory diseases (COVID-19), with serious infection of the lower respiratory tract followed by bronchitis, pneumonia and fibrosis.
NA,The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms.
NA,The new CoV-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome.
NA,If CoV-19 would spread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths.
NA,Moreover, people from the poorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities.
NA,To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and the collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission.
NA,In the case of a pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals.
NA,At present, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death.
NA,One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone.
NA,It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected.
NA,In addition, germicidal UV radiation &quot;breaks down&quot; the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration.
NA,All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk of infection by CoV-19.
NA,New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration.
NA,For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis.
NA,Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19.
NA,We strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.
NA,The last month of 2019 harbingered the emergence of a viral outbreak that is now a major public threat globally.
NA,COVID-19 was first diagnosed and confirmed in a couple of cases with unknown pneumonia; the patients lived in, or travelled to, Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.
NA,People now face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally.
NA,Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched.
NA,In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19.
NA,Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems-for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases-are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19.
NA,Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.
NA,As we face an explosion of COVID-19 cases and deal with an unprecedented set of circumstances all over the world, healthcare personnel are at the forefront, dealing with this emerging scenario.
NA,Certain subspecialties like interventional radiology entails a greater risk of acquiring and transmitting infection due to the close patient contact and invasive patient care the service provides.
NA,This makes it imperative to develop and set guidelines in place to limit transmission and utilize resources in an optimal fashion.
NA,A multi-tiered approach needs to be devised and monitored at the administrative level, taking into account the various staff and patient contact points.
NA,Based on these factors, work site and health force rearrangements need to be in place while enforcing segregation and disinfection parameters.
NA,We are putting forth an all-encompassing review of infection control measures that cover the dynamics of patient care and staff protocols that such a situation demands of an interventional department.
NA,COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging zoonotic corona virus of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) family.
NA,COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020.
NA,For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age.
NA,This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging.
NA,Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19.
NA,One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).
NA,Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence.
NA,Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity.
NA,Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase.
NA,Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication.
NA,Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment.
NA,Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts.
NA,As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.
NA,The Novel corona virus 2019 which started as an outbreak in China in December 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world, such that on 11th March 2020 WHO declared this disease as pandemic.
NA,The emergency that the world faces today demands that we develop urgent and effective measures to protect people at high risk of transmission.
NA,WHO has accelerated research in diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.
NA,The outbreak of the new Coronavirus in China in December 2019 and subsequently in various countries around the world has raised concerns about the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus.
NA,The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard.
NA,In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them.
NA,All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included.
NA,A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns.
NA,There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women.
NA,Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery.
NA,For confirmed cases both the mother and the newborn child should be followed up comprehensively.
NA,While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100 000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities.
NA,Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease.
NA,To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.
NA,In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations.
NA,During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.
NA,Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years.
NA,Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens.
NA,A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions.
NA,By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms.
NA,In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19.
NA,Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.
NA,The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) imposes a major challenge in managing patients undergoing surgical operation.
NA,In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff.
NA,There were 13 males and 12 females.
NA,The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years.
NA,The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years.
NA,By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%).
NA,Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history.
NA,We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039).
NA,A potential &quot;super spreader&quot; may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection.
NA,It was concluded that Covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation, especially for those with COPD.
NA,Implementation of comprehensive protective measures is important to control nosocomial infection.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to our National Health Service (NHS) (1).
NA,As the need to appropriately direct all efforts towards providing emergency supportive care to those suffering, there will be a knee-jerk tendency to cancel all outpatient activity by NHS trusts.
NA,Whilst this appears to be a pragmatic approach to reducing risk of transmission, there will be an unmet cost to those patients who are high-risk and are already on the cancer referral pathway.
NA,From its beginning in December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has spread globally from Wuhan and is now declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,The sheer scale and severity of this pandemic is unprecedented in the modern era.
NA,Though primarily a respiratory tract infection transmitted by direct contact and droplets, during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) there is a possibility of airborne transmission.
NA,In addition, emerging evidence suggests possible fecal-oral spread of the virus.
NA,Clinical departments that perform endoscopy are faced with daunting challenges during this pandemic.
NA,To date, multiple position statements and guidelines have been issued by various professional organizations to recommend practices in endoscopic procedures.
NA,This article aims to summarize and discuss available evidence for these practices, to provide guidance for endoscopy to enhance patient safety, avoid nosocomial outbreaks, protect healthcare personnel and ensure rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,Responses adapted to national recommendations, local infection control guidelines and tailored to the availability of medical resources are imminently needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging healthcare systems at a global level.
NA,We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed.
NA,Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy.
NA,The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized.
NA,Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread.
NA,It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment.
NA,Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively.
NA,When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised.
NA,Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules.
NA,Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery.
NA,These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk spreading the virus.
NA,It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels.
NA,A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided.
NA,Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking.
NA,Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.
NA,We propose a mathematical model to investigate the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.
NA,Our model describes the multiple transmission pathways in the infection dynamics, and emphasizes the role of the environmental reservoir in the transmission and spread of this disease.
NA,Our model also employs non-constant transmission rates which change with the epidemiological status and environmental conditions and which reflect the impact of the on-going disease control measures.
NA,We conduct a detailed analysis of this model, and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data.
NA,Among other findings, our analytical and numerical results indicate that the coronavirus infection would remain endemic, which necessitates long-term disease prevention and intervention programs.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities of China is a growing global concern.
NA,Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19.
NA,In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model.
NA,Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection.
NA,More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.
NA,To rapidly assess possible community transmission in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands, healthcare workers (HCW) with mild respiratory complaints and without epidemiological link (contact with confirmed case or visited areas with active circulation) were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Within 2 days, 1,097 HCW in nine hospitals were tested; 45 (4.1%) were positive.
NA,Of six hospitals with positive HCW, two accounted for 38 positive HCW.
NA,The results informed local and national risk management.
NA,Sustained coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission is ongoing in Italy, with 7,375 reported cases and 366 deaths by 8 March 2020.
NA,We provide a model-based evaluation of patient records from Lombardy, predicting the impact of an uncontrolled epidemic on the healthcare system.
NA,It has the potential to cause more than 250,039 (95% credible interval (CrI): 147,717-459,890) cases within 3 weeks, including 37,194 (95% CrI: 22,250-67,632) patients requiring intensive care.
NA,Aggressive containment strategies are required.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of 5 confirmed COVID⁃19 cases related with the transmission in incubation period of initial case, and find out the infection source and transmission chain.. <b>Methods:</b> According to &quot;The Prevention and Control Protocol for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Third Edition)&quot; issued by the National Health Commission, a field epidemiological survey was conducted for the 5 cases in January 2020.
NA,Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from them for the detection of 2019-nCoV by real time RT-PCR.
NA,Multi prevention and control measures were taken, such as tracking and screening close contacts, medical isolation observation, investigating the epidemiological link, analyzing transmission chain. <b>Results:</b> Case 1, who had common environmental exposure with other COVID⁃19 cases, got sick on 20 January, 2020 and was confirmed on 1 February.
NA,Case 2 became symptomatic on 22 January and was confirmed on 27 January.
NA,Case 3 got sick on 25 January and was confirmed on 30 January.
NA,Case 4 had illness onset on 20 January and was confirmed on 1 February.
NA,Case 5 got sick on 23 January and was confirmed on 31 January.
NA,Among the 5 cases, case 2 died and the illness of other cases were effectively controlled.
NA,After exclusion of other common exposure factors, case 1 had a 6-hour meeting with case 2 and case 3 on 19 January.
NA,Case 2 and case 3 might be infected by case 1 during the incubation period.
NA,It is the key point for epidemiological investigation. <b>Conclusion:</b> The epidemiological investigation indicates that the transmission might occur in the incubation period of COVID-19 case, close attention should be paid to it in future COVID-19 prevention and control. <b>目的：</b> 对上海市一起由新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID⁃19）病例在潜伏期传染的聚集性疫情开展流行病学调查，查明感染来源和病例传播链。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 按照新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控方案（第三版）要求，2020年1月采用现场流行病学调查方法，对5例病例开展个案调查，采集鼻咽拭子和痰液等标本，采用real time RT-PCR检测新型冠状病毒核酸，追踪排查密切接触者并采取隔离医学观察，调查病例间的流行病学联系，分析传播链等，并及时落实相关防控措施。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 病例一于2020年1月20日发病，有与COVID-19确诊病例共同环境的暴露史，2月1日确诊；病例二于1月22日发病，1月27日确诊；病例三于1月25日发病，1月30日确诊；病例四于1月20日发病，2月1日确诊；病例五于1月23日发病，1月31日确诊。
NA,5例病例中，除病例二死亡外，其余4例病例病情均得到有效控制。
NA,本起疫情中，排除其他的共同暴露因素后，1月19日病例一和病例二及病例三参加了6 h的聚会，病例一在潜伏期内可能造成病例二和病例三的感染，这是流行病学调查的关键节点。
NA,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19病例在潜伏内可能具有传染性，这对后面的疫情防控工作带来一定的警示和借鉴作用。.
NA,The safety of performing spinal anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists alike in the presence of active infection with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear.
NA,Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia.
NA,Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study.
NA,Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded.
NA,For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed.
NA,Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]).
NA,Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively.
NA,No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia.
NA,Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists.
NA,One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7-99.4]; P&lt;0.01).
NA,Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections.
NA,Level 3 PPE appears to reduce the risk of transmission to anaesthetists who are exposed to mildly symptomatic surgical patients.
NA,As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19.
NA,The main objective was to report real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) case fatality rate (CFR).
NA,Data were mainly obtained from WHO website, up to 9 March 2020.
NA,R(t) was estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time dependent (TD) methods. &quot;R0&quot; package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve.
NA,Both naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjust CFR (aCFR) were estimated.
NA,In EG method, R(t) was 3.27 [3.17-3.38] for Italy, 6.32 [5.72-6.99] for France, 6.07 [5.51-6.69] for Germany, 5.08 [4.51-5.74] for Spain.
NA,With TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 [2.21-4.11] for Italy, 6.56 [2.04-12.26] for France, 4.43 [1.83-7.92] for Germany, and 3.95 [0-10.19] for Spain.
NA,This study provides important findings on an early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe.
NA,Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new human coronavirus which is spreading with epidemic features in China and other Asian countries with cases reported worldwide.
NA,This novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,Although related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which have not been completely understood to date.
NA,We provide a review of the differences in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features between COVID-19, SARS and MERS.
NA,The most recent literature in English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics.
NA,COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features.
NA,However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than SARS (9.5%) and much lower than MERS (34.4%).
NA,It cannot be excluded that because of the COVID-19 less severe clinical picture it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS.
NA,The actual basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) of COVID-19 (2-2.5) is still controversial.
NA,It is probably slightly higher than the R<sub>0</sub> of SARS (1.7-1.9) and higher than MERS (&lt;1),.
NA,The gastrointestinal route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which has been also assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs to be further investigated.
NA,There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and capacity of spreading on a pandemic level.
NA,Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons to face this new global threat.
NA,In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
NA,Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days.
NA,Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients.
NA,This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19.
NA,Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article.
NA,In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.
NA,The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems.
NA,Preventing further transmission is a priority.
NA,We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic.
NA,We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale.
NA,A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people.
NA,By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock-downs') that are harmful to society.
NA,We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.
NA,18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China.
NA,After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia.
NA,Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
NA,It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown.
NA,Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded.
NA,Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.
NA,Herein we will provide with an update on the main features of COVID-19 and suggest possible solutions how to halt the expansion of this novel pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory tract infection that emerged in late 2019<sup>1,2</sup>.
NA,Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses<sup>3</sup>.
NA,This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung<sup>2,4</sup>.
NA,By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003<sup>5</sup>.
NA,However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission<sup>6-8</sup>.
NA,There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity.
NA,Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues.
NA,Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 10<sup>8</sup> RNA copies per throat swab, day 4).
NA,Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration.
NA,Blood and urine never yielded virus.
NA,Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples.
NA,Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication.
NA,Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms.
NA,Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load.
NA,COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.
NA,Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.
NA,The rapid spread of the epidemic has aroused widespread concern in the international community.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) originated from Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market, with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts.
NA,The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2.
NA,Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection.
NA,The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible.
NA,The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic.
NA,The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days.
NA,The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first.
NA,Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate.
NA,Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts.
NA,With powerful government intervention and the efforts of Chinese medical staff, China's outbreak has gradually improved.
NA,<b>Introduction</b>: At the end of 2019, Wuhan, a city in China with a population of about 11 million, witnessed the outbreak of unusual pneumonia.
NA,As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness.<b>Areas covered</b>: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19.
NA,Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19.
NA,Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19.
NA,Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19.
NA,Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation.
NA,The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.
NA,<b>Background:</b> Since early December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) infection has been prevalent in China and eventually spread to other countries.
NA,There are a few published cases of COVID-19 occurring during pregnancy and due the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. <b>Results:</b> A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported.
NA,No COVID-19 infection was detected in their neonates or placentas.
NA,Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. <b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.
NA,Mothers may be at increased risk for more severe respiratory complications.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic, with over 720,000 cases reported in more than 203 countries as of 31 March.
NA,The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine.
NA,In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
NA,Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015.
NA,An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined.
NA,This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response.
NA,Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations.
NA,In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine.
NA,Several challenges remain for the global use and integration of telemedicine into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.
NA,All stakeholders are encouraged to address the challenges and collaborate to promote the safe and evidence-based use of telemedicine during the current pandemic and future outbreaks.
NA,For countries without integrated telemedicine in their national health care system, the COVID-19 pandemic is a call to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine.
NA,First reported in China, the 2019 novel coronavirus has been spreading across the globe.
NA,Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over.
NA,The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction.
NA,Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care.
NA,Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation.
NA,Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms.
NA,Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers.
NA,Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission.
NA,Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.
NA,The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment.
NA,Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation.
NA,Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases.
NA,Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus.
NA,Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia.
NA,At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol.
NA,We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.
NA,During the current rapidly evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants form a special vulnerable group that needs immediate attention.
NA,Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths will continue.
NA,Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.
NA,The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline.
NA,A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted.
NA,The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care.
NA,An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize.
NA,Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations.
NA,Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed.
NA,For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles.
NA,The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations.
NA,To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period.
NA,A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions.
NA,During the COVID-19 outbreak, China made great progress in controlling the epidemic, and the number of confirmed and suspected cases continues to decrease thanks to the various efforts employed.
NA,Mobile field hospitals have played a huge role in the centralized management of patients and they have effectively reduced transmission.
NA,This article describes some of our experiences operating mobile field hospitals in order to provide a reference and to better inform countries that are dealing with this crisis.
NA,In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
NA,In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).
NA,All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.
NA,All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection.
NA,Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.
NA,Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.
NA,The study cohort included 102 adult patients.
NA,The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female.
NA,A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.
NA,Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%).
NA,Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities.
NA,They were also less likely suffered from complications.
NA,There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.
NA,Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs.
NA,35.3%).
NA,Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.
NA,12.9%).
NA,The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis.
NA,Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU.
NA,Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission.
NA,There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.
NA,During January 26-February 10, 2020, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in an air-conditioned restaurant in Guangzhou, China, involved 3 family clusters.
NA,The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission.
NA,To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants, we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation.
NA,We analyzed 2 clusters of 12 patients in Vietnam with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during January-February 2020.
NA,Analysis indicated virus transmission from a traveler from China.
NA,One asymptomatic patient demonstrated virus shedding, indicating potential virus transmission in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms.
NA,Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate of phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom.
NA,An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research.
NA,Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or ≥58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or &quot;other&quot;), as well as all permutations of these strata.
NA,The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population.
NA,Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis.
NA,Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020.
NA,A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire.
NA,Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between £15,000 and £74,999.
NA,US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively.
NA,Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior.
NA,For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was &quot;highly effective&quot; in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants.
NA,Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population.
NA,The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media.
NA,More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1).
NA,A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2).
NA,On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28.
NA,By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents.
NA,Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days.
NA,Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic.
NA,Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing.
NA,The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms.
NA,Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19.
NA,Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3).
NA,Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity.
NA,Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown.
NA,We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China.
NA,The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020.
NA,Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection.
NA,Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure.
NA,High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (≥10 minutes within 2 meters).
NA,Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S.
NA,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions.
NA,Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points.
NA,In 8 pairs (73%), ≥1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative.
NA,Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive.
NA,Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure.
NA,In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative.
NA,This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts.
NA,These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.
NA,Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it.
NA,Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians.
NA,It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment.
NA,In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine.
NA,These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations.
NA,Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an urgent public health crisis, with epidemiologic models predicting severe consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is permitted to run its course without any intervention or response.
NA,Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location.
NA,The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data.
NA,We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach.
NA,Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption.
NA,Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create &quot;checkpoints&quot; for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network.
NA,Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak.
NA,Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak.
NA,This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.
NA,Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examinations may be required in COVID-19 patients, resulting in direct contact with the patient and a risk of infection transmission from patients to personnel.
NA,Therefore, we recommend to perform problem-oriented, time-limited transthoracic studies.
NA,Whenever possible studies should be analyzed off-line outside isolation zones.
NA,Transesophageal echocardiography is considered an aerosol-generating procedure and should be performed only in lifesaving indications.
NA,Personnel should use appropriate personal protection equipment in the immediate vicinity of the patients, according to the relevant guidelines.
NA,Polish version of this document can be found in the &quot;Supplementary data&quot; tab.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 is expanding globally.
NA,South Korea is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19 from the very early stages of this pandemic.
NA,Explosive outbreaks occurred across South Korea in the first two months, and efforts to control this new virus have involved everyone across the country.
NA,To curb the transmission of the virus, health-care professionals, committees, and governments have combined many approaches, such as extensive COVID-19 screening, effective patient triage, the transparent provision of information, and the use of information technology.
NA,This experience could provide some valuable ideas and lessons to others who are fighting against COVID-19.
NA,Awareness and attentiveness have implications for the acceptance and adoption of disease prevention and control measures.
NA,Social media posts provide a record of the public's attention to an outbreak.
NA,To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to COVID-19, a pre-established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID-19-related keywords in their posts.
NA,COVID-19-related posts (N=1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52,268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019 - February 12, 2020).
NA,Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20.
NA,Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time.
NA,Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23-24, 8-9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and following the death of Dr.
NA,Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online.
NA,Limited early warnings represent missed opportunities to engage citizens earlier in the outbreak.
NA,Governments should more proactively communicate early warnings to the public in a transparent manner.
NA,To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province.
NA,National surveillance studies, 2008-17. 31 provinces in mainland China.
NA,4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases.
NA,The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne.
NA,Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases.
NA,From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females).
NA,The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males.
NA,Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017.
NA,Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared.
NA,The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza.
NA,Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017.
NA,The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline.
NA,Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria.
NA,Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza.
NA,Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017.
NA,Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males.
NA,Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases.
NA,China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare.
NA,Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic.
NA,Risk of transmission may occur during endoscopy and the goal is to prevent infection among healthcare professionals while providing essential services to patients.
NA,Asia was the first continent to have a COVID-19 outbreak, and this position statement of the Asian Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy shares our successful experience in maintaining safe and high-quality endoscopy practice at a time when resources are limited.
NA,Sixteen experts from key societies of digestive endoscopy in Asia were invited to develop position statements, including patient triage and risk assessment before endoscopy, resource prioritisation and allocation, regular monitoring of personal protective equipment, infection control measures, protective device training and implementation of a strategy for stepwise resumption of endoscopy services after control of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,To study the GI symptoms in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.
NA,We analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 95 cases with SARS-CoV-2 caused coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and GI tissues.
NA,Among the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation.
NA,Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively.
NA,A substantial proportion of patients developed diarrhoea during hospitalisation, potentially aggravated by various drugs including antibiotics.
NA,Faecal samples of 65 hospitalised patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including 42 with and 23 without GI symptoms, of which 22 (52.4%) and 9 (39.1%) were positive, respectively.
NA,Six patients with GI symptoms were subjected to endoscopy, revealing oesophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers in one severe patient.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum specimens for both two severe patients.
NA,In contrast, only duodenum was positive in one of the four non-severe patients.
NA,GI tract may be a potential transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy is significantly important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread.
NA,One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure.
NA,The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size.
NA,We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19).
NA,Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered.
NA,The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22.
NA,The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening.
NA,Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23.
NA,After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days.
NA,The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education.
NA,After March 23, although the possibility of massive transmission in the children's age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur.
NA,The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spread to Italy with heavy consequences on public health and economics.
NA,Besides the possible consequences of COVID-19 infection on a pregnant woman and the fetus, a major concern is related to the potential effect on neonatal outcome, the appropriate management of the mother-newborn dyad and finally the compatibility of maternal COVID-19 infection with breastfeeding.
NA,The Italian Society on Neonatology (SIN) after reviewing the limited scientific knowledge on the compatibility of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 mother and the available statements from Health Care Organizations, has issued the following indications that have been endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal &amp; Perinatal Societies (UENPS).
NA,If a mother previously identified as COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19 is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic at delivery, rooming-in is feasible and direct breastfeeding is advisable, under strict measures of infection control.
NA,On the contrary, when a mother with COVID-19 is too sick to care for the newborn, the neonate will be managed separately and fed fresh expressed breast milk, with no need to pasteurize it, as human milk is not believed to be a vehicle of COVID-19.
NA,We recognize that this guidance might be subject to change in the future when further knowledge will be acquired about the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical characteristics of cases of neonatal COVID-19.
NA,As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread over the world, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of COVID-19 an international public health emergency.
NA,Besides typical respiratory symptoms and signs of COVID-19, digestive symptoms and liver injury have been frequently reported during the course of the disease.
NA,In this review, we summarized the recent studies reporting of gastrointestinal and liver manifestations during the course of COVID-19.
NA,Digestive symptoms, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and in some cases digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any respiratory symptoms.
NA,Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the stool of infected patients, implicating the possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
NA,Attention should also be paid to monitor liver function during the course of COVID-19, especially in patients with higher disease severity.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic.
NA,Global health care now faces unprecedented challenges with widespread and rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and high morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 worldwide.
NA,Across the world, the medical care is hampered by a critical shortage of not only hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment, ventilators and hospital beds, but also impediments to the blood supply.
NA,Blood donation centers in many areas around the globe have mostly closed.
NA,Donors, practicing social distancing, some either with illness or undergoing self-quarantine, are quickly diminishing.
NA,Drastic public health initiatives have focused on containment and &quot;flattening the curve&quot; while invaluable resources are being depleted.
NA,In some countries, the point is reached at which demand for such resources, including donor blood outstrips supply.
NA,Questions as to the safety of blood persist.
NA,Although it does not appear very likely that the virus can be transmitted through allogeneic blood transfusion, this still remains to be fully determined.
NA,As options dwindle, we must enact regional and national shortage plans worldwide, and more vitally disseminate the knowledge of and immediately implement Patient Blood Management (PBM).
NA,PBM is an evidence-based bundle of care to optimize medical and surgical patient outcomes by clinically managing and preserving a patient's own blood.
NA,This multinational and diverse group of authors issue this &quot;Call to Action&quot; underscoring &quot;The Essential Role of Patient Blood Management in the Management of Pandemics&quot; and urging all stakeholders and providers to implement the practical and common-sense principles of PBM and its multi-professional and multimodality approaches.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory epidemic is creating a stressed situation in all the health systems of the affected countries.
NA,Emergency medical systems and specifically the emergency departments as the front line of the health systems are suffering from overload and severe working conditions, the risk of contagion and transmission of the health professionals adds a substantial burden to their daily work.
NA,Under the perspective of European Society For Emergency Medicine, the recommendations provided by the health authorities are reviewed focus on the emergency department's activity.
NA,A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other cities and countries.
NA,To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020.
NA,To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated.
NA,A well-mixed &quot;susceptible exposed infectious recovered&quot; (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority.
NA,Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention.
NA,The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.

NA,In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally.
NA,However, the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood.
NA,In this study, we aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in excreta of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed.
NA,Pharyngeal swab, stool and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR.
NA,Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness.
NA,A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness.
NA,Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in feces after pharyngeal swabs turned negative.
NA,The duration of viral shedding from feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity.
NA,The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did no differ between patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces.
NA,Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients.
NA,Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of COVID-19 patients, and suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route.

NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally since being identified as a public health emergency of major international concern and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China.
NA,The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission.
NA,Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance.
NA,They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections.
NA,Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors.
NA,Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population.
NA,With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients.
NA,This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic.
NA,Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic.
NA,In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches.

NA,The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already reached a pandemic dimension within few weeks.
NA,Italy has been one of the first countries dealing with the outbreak of COVID-19 and severe measures have been adopted to limit viral transmission.
NA,The spread of COVID-19 may have several implications in organ transplant activity that physicians should be aware of.
NA,The initial experience gained during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that around 10% of infected patients in Italy need intensive care management to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,Due to the exponential rise of infected patients we are now facing an actual risk of saturation of intensive care unit (ICU) beds.
NA,A restriction in the number of ICU beds available for both donors and transplant recipients may unfavorably influence the overall donation activity, and eventually lead to a reduced number of transplants.
NA,Preliminary Italian data show that a 25% reduction of procured organs has already occurred during the first 4 weeks of COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,This underlines the need to closely monitor what will be further happening in ICUs due to the COVID-19 spread in the attempt to preserve transplant activity, especially in Western countries where deceased donors represent the major organ resource.
NA,International experience with COVID-19 suggests it poses a significant risk of infectious transmission to skull base surgeons, due to high nasal viral titers and the unknown potential for aerosol generation during endonasal instrumentation.
NA,The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment.
NA,Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2mg/10ml) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing.
NA,Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers.
NA,Surgical aerosolization was simulated during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling following nasal fluorescein application.
NA,Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30cm extending to 66cm.
NA,Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread.
NA,Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols.
NA,Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all tested conditions.
NA,We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon.
NA,In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread.
NA,Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill.
NA,Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an &quot;Aerosol Generating Surgery&quot; to convey this unique risk, and support the need for protective PPE.

NA,In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole of China and to multiple countries worldwide.
NA,Unlike SARS and MERS, where secondary transmission mostly occurred in hospital settings, COVID-19 transmission occurs in large numbers within families.
NA,Herein we report three cases of a familial cluster with one family member being a kidney transplant recipient.
NA,The initial clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in these three patients were the same, but their progression was different.
NA,Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward.
NA,In contrast, the son received in-home isolation and home-based care.
NA,All three family members made a full recovery.
NA,The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness.
NA,A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins.
NA,Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials.
NA,Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities.
NA,Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B.
NA,Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses.
NA,This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body.
NA,An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids.
NA,These particles are also likelier to remain active longer.
NA,These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.
NA,Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus and associated lung disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic.
NA,In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally.
NA,Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome.
NA,Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome.
NA,This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes.
NA,Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging.
NA,Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs.
NA,We here describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 and became epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
NA,COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world.
NA,The virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but distinct from it.
NA,Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders.
NA,Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection.
NA,In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed.
NA,The COVID-19 may alter immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants.
NA,In this review, we focused on the reason why pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 and the potential maternal and fetal complications from an immunological viewpoint.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the incidence trend and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province. <b>Methods:</b> The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi.
NA,Most cases were mild (87.76%).
NA,As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase.
NA,The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province.
NA,The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission.
NA,The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi.
NA,After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. <b>Conclusions:</b> At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated.
NA,However, considering the approaching of return to work and study and the increasing of imported cases from other countries, the prevention and control of COVIS-19 in Shaanxi will face new challenges. <b>目的：</b> 了解陕西省新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的发病趋势及流行特征。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 收集陕西省截至2020年2月22日COVID-19的疫情数据，进行流行病学描述性分析。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 陕西省共报告245例COVID-19确诊病例，全省累积报告的确诊病例以轻型、普通型为主（87.76%），随着时间的推移，出现确诊病例的地区不断扩大，以西安市报告病例数最多（占全省报告总病例数近一半）。
NA,陕西省由输入型病例逐渐转为本地病例为主，而本地病例的传播途径主要以家庭聚集性传播为主。
NA,陕西省不同来源确诊病例均造成了二代病例传播。
NA,2月7日之后报告病例数开始波动下降并逐渐趋于平稳，目前陕西省疫情发展处于归零期。
NA,<b>结论：</b> 陕西省的总体疫情形势已趋向缓和，但考虑到复工返学的到来，同时随着境外输入病例的不断增加，防控工作将面临新的挑战。.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading with a rising death toll and transmission rate reported in high income countries rather than in low income countries.
NA,The overburdened healthcare systems and poor disease surveillance systems in resource-limited settings may struggle to cope with this COVID-19 outbreak and this calls for a tailored strategic response for these settings.
NA,Here, we recommend a low cost blockchain and artificial intelligence-coupled self-testing and tracking systems for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases.
NA,Prompt deployment and appropriate implementation of the proposed system have the potential to curb the transmissions of COVID-19 and the related mortalities, particularly in settings with poor access to laboratory infrastructure.
NA,In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases.
NA,Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness.
NA,To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics.
NA,In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> Without self-isolation, when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States.
NA,Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity.
NA,When <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation.
NA,In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%).
NA,Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak.
NA,Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.
NA,As part of the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) study, acute respiratory infections (ARI) have been identified in children and adults over 8 years.
NA,Annually, 890 to 1441 individuals were followed and contacted weekly to report ARIs.
NA,Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63.
NA,In total, 993 HCoV infections were identified over 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least.
NA,HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May, and peaked in January/February.
NA,Highest infection frequency was in children &lt;5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range: 7 to 11 per 100 person-years).
NA,Overall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation.
NA,Of the 993 infections, 260 were acquired from an infected household contact.
NA,The serial interval between index and household-acquired cases ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days and the secondary infection risk ranged from 7.2% to 12.6% by type.
NA,Coronaviruses are sharply seasonal.
NA,They appear, based on serial interval and secondary infection risk, to have similar transmission potential to influenza A(H3N2) in the same population.
NA,The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia.
NA,In Northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China.
NA,Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak.
NA,We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care unit(s) (ICU) for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated ICU in personal protective equipment use and patient management.
NA,Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad-hoc training.
NA,Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented.
NA,Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required a multidisciplinary, multilevel involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety.
NA,Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and update on a daily basis.
NA,Personal protective equipment has become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic.
NA,COVID-19 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately one metre from the patient.
NA,Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols.
NA,These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain.
NA,Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation.
NA,Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection.
NA,Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission.
NA,Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care - contact, droplet, or airborne.
NA,Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not.
NA,Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol-generating procedures.
NA,Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipment including use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China.
NA,Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.
NA,We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020.
NA,We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset.
NA,We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals.
NA,We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) at the provincial level.
NA,We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces.
NA,The median age of cases was 44 years (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged &gt;64 years) as the epidemic progressed.
NA,The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0-14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0-9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17.
NA,The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8-12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3-11·6).
NA,The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission.
NA,We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74-1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32-2·17) in Shandong province.
NA,In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, &lt;1) after Jan 30.
NA,Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms.
NA,Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community.
NA,Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

NA,With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a worldwide health concern.
NA,One previous study reported a family cluster with asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers.
NA,A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital.
NA,We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families.
NA,Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan.
NA,Additionally, two family members, those who had not travelled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members.
NA,Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU.
NA,Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days 2 through 3 of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs.
NA,Case 4 presented with diarrhoea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities.
NA,Case 2 presented no clinical or radiographic abnormalities.
NA,All the cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein.
NA,Our findings indicate that COVID-19 can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period.
NA,Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in December, Chinese government has implemented various measures including travel bans, centralized treatments, and home quarantines to slowing the transmission across the country.
NA,In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China.
NA,We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine.
NA,We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population.
NA,A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%.
NA,Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years.
NA,Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine.
NA,Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020.
NA,The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5‰ (95% CI: 0.31‰-4.37‰).
NA,Home quarantine has been effective in preventing the early transmission of COVID-19, but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of COVID-19 infection.
NA,The World Health Organization has recently defined the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection a pandemic.
NA,The infection, that may cause a potentially very severe respiratory disease, now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has airborne transmission <i>via</i> droplets.
NA,The rate of transmission is quite high, higher than common influenza.
NA,Healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting the infection particularly when applying respiratory devices such as oxygen cannulas or noninvasive ventilation.
NA,The aim of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the correct use of &quot;respiratory devices&quot; in the COVID-19 emergency and protect healthcare workers from contracting the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019.
NA,Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission.
NA,COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death.
NA,Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities.
NA,Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease.
NA,We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.
NA,Imaging modalities play a crucial role in the management of suspected COVID-19-infected patients.
NA,Before reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results are positive, 60-93% of patients have positive chest computed tomographic (CT) findings consistent with COVID-19 infection.
NA,We report a case of positive lung ultrasound findings consistent with COVID-19 in a woman with an initial negative RT-PCR result.
NA,The lung ultrasound-imaging findings were present between the negative and subsequent positive RT-PCR tests and correlated with CT findings.
NA,The point-of-care lung-ultrasound examination was easy to perform and, as such, could play an important role in the triage of women with suspected COVID-19.
NA,The neonatal swabs, cord blood, and placental swab RT-PCR tests were negative for SARS-CoV-2, a finding consistent with the published literature suggesting no vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women.

NA,The recent pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is unarguably the most fearsome compared with the earlier outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
NA,Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
NA,Where variations in the viral spike protein, in turn, lead to the cross-species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2 may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection.
NA,This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
NA,Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modeling.
NA,The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively.
NA,Despite strong overall structural similarities, the spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared with the wild-type molecule.
NA,Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild-type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
NA,However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein.
NA,In summary, our data provide a structural basis of potential resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection driven by ACE2 allelic variants.
NA,The challenges faced by the Global South during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are compounded by the presence of informal settlements, which are typically densely populated and lacking in formalized sanitation infrastructure.
NA,Social distancing measures in informal settlements may be difficult to implement due to the density and layout of settlements.
NA,This study measures the distance between dwellings in informal settlements in Cape Town to identify the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,The aim of this paper is to determine if social distancing measures are achievable in informal settlements in Cape Town, using two settlements as an example.
NA,We will first examine the distance between dwellings and their first, second, and third nearest neighbors and then identify clusters of dwellings in which residents would be unable to effectively practice social isolation due to the close proximity of their homes.
NA,Dwellings in the settlements of Masiphumelele and Klipfontein Glebe were extracted from a geographic information system data set of outlines of all informal dwellings in Cape Town.
NA,The distance to each dwelling's first, second, and third nearest neighbors was calculated for each settlement.
NA,A social distance measure of 2 m was used (buffer of 1 m, as dwellings less than 2 m apart are joined) to identify clusters of dwellings that are unable to effectively practice social distancing in each settlement.
NA,The distance to each dwelling's first 3 nearest neighbors illustrates that the settlement of Masiphumelele is constructed in a denser fashion as compared to the Klipfontein Glebe settlement.
NA,This implies that implementing social distancing will likely be more challenging in Masiphumelele than in Klipfontein Glebe.
NA,However, using a 2-m social distancing measure, it was demonstrated that large portions of Klipfontein Glebe would also be unable to effectively implement social distancing.
NA,Effectively implementing social distancing may be a challenge in informal settlements due to their density.
NA,This paper uses dwelling outlines for informal settlements in the city of Cape Town to demonstrate that with a 2 m measure, effective social distancing will be challenging.
NA,As part of the response plans for the current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), authorities are drafting and implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to slow down transmission and reduce the infection rate.
NA,A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures.
NA,The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva.
NA,Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland.
NA,Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020.
NA,From February 25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total views=332).
NA,User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD 14.4) users per day in this period as compared to the previous weeks (mean 26.4, SD 9.8; P&lt;.001).
NA,In addition, session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period (P&lt;.001).
NA,In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the app.
NA,On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3).
NA,The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus-related information seemed to be an effective and time-saving communication channel within our institution during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
NA,Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice.
NA,More research should be done on the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.
NA,Despite the availability of prevention guidelines and recommendations on infection control, many dental practices lack the minimum requirements for infection control.
NA,This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists.
NA,The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan.
NA,An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020.
NA,The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19.
NA,This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years).
NA,A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19.
NA,A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days.
NA,The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics.
NA,A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission.
NA,Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, and infection controls and measures in dental clinics.
NA,However, dentists had limited comprehension of the extra precautionary measures that protect the dental staff and other patients from COVID-19.
NA,National and international guidelines should be sent by the regional and national dental associations to all registered dentists during a crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, to make sure that dentists are well informed and aware of best practices and recommended disease management approaches.
NA,Background: During outbreaks of diseases a great amount of health threatening misinformation is produced and released.
NA,In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly.
NA,Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis.
NA,Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries.
NA,Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation.
NA,Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed.
NA,Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination.
NA,Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak.
NA,Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones.
NA,Active and effective presence of health professionals and authorities on social media during the crisis and the improvement of public health literacy in the long term are the most recommended strategies for dealing with issues related to misinformation.
NA,Conclusion: This study contributes the management of COVID-19 outbreak trough providing applicable insights for health managers to manage public information in this challenging time.
NA,Hong Kong has been recently attacked by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In late January 2020, it's shown a steadily increasing trend of confirmed cases.
NA,There is a 257 in total infected cases confirmed including 4 deaths until 20<sup>th</sup> of March 2020.
NA,To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.
NA,From 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found 2 asymptomatic infections.
NA,One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment.
NA,Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his TR-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day.
NA,We found that there may be virus carriers in asymptomatic population with epidemiological contact history.
NA,After 14 days of isolation, asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means the risk of transmission and present a new challenge to home isolation.
NA,Describe the clinical characteristics of patients in Fangcang Hospital.
NA,Non-critically ill patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests admitted to Dongxihu 'Fangcang' Hospital between February 7th and 12th were included, which was promptly constructed because of the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China; clinical course through February 22nd was recorded. 1012 non-critically ill patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were included in the study. 30 (of 1012, 3.0%) patients were asymptomatic on admission.
NA,During hospitalization, 16 of 30 (53.3%) asymptomatic patients suffered from different symptoms.
NA,Fourteen of 1012 patients (1.4%) remained asymptomatic from exposure to the end of follow-up, with a median duration of 24 days (IQR 22-27).
NA,Fever (761 of 1012, 75.2%) and cough (531 of 1012, 52.4%) were the most common symptoms.
NA,Small patchy opacities (355 of 917, 38.7%)and ground-glass opacities (508 of 917, 55.4%) were common imaging manifestations in chest CT scan.
NA,One hundred patients (9.9%) were transferred to designated hospitals due to aggravation of illness.
NA,Diarrhea emerged in 152 of 1012 patients (15.0%).
NA,Male, elder age, diabetes cardiovascular diseases, chills, dyspnea, SO<sub>2</sub> value of ≤93%, WBC counts of &gt;10 ×10<sup>9</sup>/L and large consolidated opacity on CT images were all risk factors for aggravation of illness.
NA,Non-critically ill patients had different clinical characteristics than critically ill patients.
NA,Asymptomatic infections only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19.
NA,Although with a low incidence, diarrhea was observed in patients with COVID-19, indicating the possibility of faecal-oral transmission.
NA,A cluster of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December 2019.
NA,A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from lower respiratory tract sample as the causative agent.
NA,The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,COVID-19 rapidly spread into at least 114 countries and killed more than 4,000 people by March 11 2020.
NA,WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
NA,There have been 2 novel coronavirus outbreaks in the past 2 decades.
NA,The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 caused by SARS-CoV had a case fatality rate of around 10% (8,098 confirmed cases and 774 deaths), while Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERSCoV killed 861 people out of a total 2,502 confirmed cases between 2012 and 2019.
NA,The purpose of this review is to summarize known-to-date information about SARS-CoV-2, transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and clinical features.
NA,Due to the current pandemic of respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection will require elective surgery, surgery that cannot be postponed, or emergency surgical treatment.
NA,In these situations, special measures need to be adopted in order to minimize the possibility of transmission between patients, exposure of healthcare personnel and the development of postoperative complications.
NA,This document explains the main principles to consider when managing confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients during evaluation as well as when surgical treatment is required.
NA,Since December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global health and is currently causing a major pandemic.
NA,While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, mounting evidence indicates that patients might also report extra-pulmonary manifestations, including those affecting the liver and gastrointestinal tract.
NA,This involvement may have important implications to the disease management, transmission, and prognosis, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic or digestive co-morbidities.
NA,In this review, the characteristics and possible explanations of hepatic and gastrointestinal involvement caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized, adding to our knowledge of the spectrum of COVID-19.
NA,In addition, preventive measures implemented in endoscopy departments to prevent further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection are proposed.
NA,To control the spread of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), China sealed Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020 and soon expanded lockdown to other twelve cities in Hubei province.
NA,We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics in one of the cities and highlight the effect of current implemented lockdown and nonpharmaceutical interventions.
NA,We retrieved data of reported cases in Huangshi and Wuhan from publicly available disease databases.
NA,Local epidemiological data on suspected or confirmed cases in Huangshi were collected through field investigation.
NA,Epidemic curves were constructed with data on reported and observed cases.
NA,The accumulated confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatality in Huangshi were reported to be 1015 and 3.74% respectively, compared with 50006 and 5.08% in Wuhan till Mar 27, 2020.
NA,Right after Jan 24, the epidemic curve based on observed cases in Huangshi became flattened.
NA,Feb 1, 2020 was identified as the &quot;turning point&quot; as the epidemic in Huangshi faded soon afterwards.
NA,COVID-19 epidemic was characterized by mild cases in Huangshi, accounting for 82.66% of total cases.
NA,Moreover, 50 asymptomatic infections were identified in adults and children.
NA,Besides, we found confirmed cases in 19 familial clusters and 21 health care workers, supporting inter-human transmission.
NA,Our study reported the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Huangshi city, China, across the unprecedented intervention.
NA,Such new epidemiological inference might provide further guidance on current lockdown measures in high-risk cities and, subsequently, help improve public health intervention strategies against the pandemic on the country and global levels.
NA,With more than 900,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50,000 deaths during the first three months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis.
NA,The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases.
NA,For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment.
NA,While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances.
NA,Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints.
NA,To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints.
NA,Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.
NA,The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus that causes COVID-19 infection, has recently emerged and caused a deadly pandemic.
NA,Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality rate in older adults and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic kidney disease.
NA,A significant percentage of older American adults have these diseases, putting them at a higher risk of infection.
NA,Additionally, many adults with hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease are placed on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
NA,Studies have shown that these medications upregulate the ACE-2 receptor, the very receptor which the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter host cells, which puts older adults at a further increased risk of infection.
NA,In this review, we discuss the transmission, symptomatology, mortality, and possible treatments for this infection, as they relate to older adults.

NA,Patients on immunomodulators, including biologic agents and new small molecular inhibitors, for cutaneous disease, represent a potentially vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of developing COVID-19 disease or more likely to have severe disease.
NA,As such, clinicians need to assess the benefit-to-risk ratio on a case-by-case basis.
NA,In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease, all immunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned.
NA,In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID-19 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1-2 weeks.
NA,In otherwise well patients, immunomodulators and biologics should be continued.
NA,In all patients, and their immediate close contacts, the importance of preventative measures to minimise human-to-human transmission cannot be over emphasized.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic.
NA,Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) of 2.2-2.7.
NA,We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period.
NA,We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data.
NA,Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days.
NA,Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R<sub>0</sub> value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9).
NA,We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.
NA,On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology.
NA,Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered.
NA,Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action.
NA,In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
NA,Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak.
NA,Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting.
NA,Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed.
NA,In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review.
NA,From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology.
NA,For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled.
NA,Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols.
NA,Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.
NA,Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns.
NA,By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China.
NA,People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track.
NA,In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method.
NA,The optimal parameters were estimated as R<sub>0</sub> = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1).
NA,Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people.
NA,Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March.
NA,It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase.
NA,If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed.
NA,It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.
NA,The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly.
NA,It is expected that the peak of epidemic situation would be reached in late February and end in March.
NA,This study aims to evaluate the risk assessments of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), from the point of detection to the provision of basic information to the relevant public health authorities.
NA,To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information.
NA,To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration.
NA,KCDC used 5 levels (&quot;very low,&quot; &quot;low,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;high,&quot; and &quot;very high&quot;) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided.
NA,A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8<sup>th</sup> to February 28<sup>th</sup>, 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries.
NA,The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: &quot;low&quot; (first), &quot;moderate&quot; (second), &quot;high&quot; (third), &quot;high&quot; (fourth), &quot;high&quot; (fifth), &quot;high&quot; (sixth), &quot;high&quot; (seventh), and &quot;very high&quot; (eighth).
NA,The KCDC's 8 risk assessments were utilized to activate national emergency response mechanisms and eventually prepare for the pandemic to ensure the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.
NA,There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 as a new emerging epidemic.
NA,In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable.
NA,However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic.
NA,Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities.
NA,The worldwide impact of COVID 19 continues to be felt as hospitals in all countries reduce elective and non-urgent cases to allow staffing and resources to be deployed elsewhere.
NA,Urgent gynaecological and cancer procedures are continuing, and it is imperative all theatre staff are protected and risks of SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission reduced when operating on asymptomatic, suspected or confirmed COVID 19 patients.
NA,In particular, there are concerns relating to the transmission of COVID 19 during gynaecological laparoscopic surgery, arising from the potential generation of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated aerosols from CO<sub>2</sub> leakage and the creation of smoke from the use of energy devices.
NA,The aim of this paper is to review all the up to date evidence, including experiences from China and Italy, to guide the safe management of such patients when undergoing gynaecological procedures.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenges hospital leaders to make time-sensitive, critical decisions about clinical operations and resource allocations.
NA,To estimate the timing of surges in clinical demand and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19-induced strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be saturated.
NA,Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of a susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) model with a 1-day cycle. 3 hospitals in an academic health system.
NA,All people living in the greater Philadelphia region.
NA,The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model (CHIME) (http://penn-chime.phl.io) SIR model was used to estimate the time from 23 March 2020 until hospital capacity would probably be exceeded, and the intensity of the surge, including for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators.
NA,Using patients with COVID-19 alone, CHIME estimated that it would be 31 to 53 days before demand exceeds existing hospital capacity.
NA,In best- and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with COVID-19, the needed total capacity for hospital beds would reach 3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU beds and 118 to 599 ventilators.
NA,Model parameters were taken directly or derived from published data across heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the health system's historical data.
NA,CHIME does not incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics, or geographic information to account for spatial patterns of human interaction.
NA,Publicly available and designed for hospital operations leaders, this modeling tool can inform preparations for capacity strain during the early days of a pandemic.
NA,University of Pennsylvania Health System and the Palliative and Advanced Illness Research Center.
NA,The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has exposed vulnerable populations to an unprecedented global health crisis.
NA,The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes.
NA,The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy.
NA,We searched databases for all case reports and series from February 12 to April 4, 2020.
NA,Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded.
NA,Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed.
NA,Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between December 8, 2019 and April 1, 2020 were included in the current study.
NA,Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%).
NA,Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% were delivered by cesarean section.
NA,Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths.
NA,One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported.
NA,Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported.
NA,Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out.
NA,Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide.
NA,To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority.
NA,We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease.
NA,SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication.
NA,Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection.
NA,At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets.
NA,Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission.
NA,Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs.
NA,Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China.
NA,Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities.
NA,However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms.
NA,To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made.
NA,Contacts were identified and risk categorized as 'close' or 'casual' for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance.
NA,Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of 'close contact'.
NA,At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts.
NA,The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period.
NA,Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.
NA,The recent global pandemic of COVID-19 highlights the urgent need for practical applications of anti-microbial coatings on touch-surfaces.
NA,Nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> is a promising candidate for the passive reduction of transmission when applied to handles, push-plates and switches in hospitals.
NA,Here we report control of the nanostructure dimension of the <i>mille-feuille</i> crystal plates in anatase columnar crystals as a function of the coating thickness.
NA,This nanoplate thickness is key to achieving the large aspect ratio of surface area to migration path length.
NA,TiO<sub>2</sub> solid coatings were prepared by pulsed-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (pp-MOCVD) under the same deposition temperature and mass flux, with thickness ranging from 1.3-16 mm, by varying the number of precursor pulses.
NA,SEM and STEM were used to measure the <i>mille-feuille</i> plate width which is believed to be a key functional nano-dimension for photocatalytic activity.
NA,Competitive growth produces a larger columnar crystal diameter with thickness.
NA,The question is if the nano-dimension also increases with columnar crystal size.
NA,We report that the nano-dimension increases with the film thickness, ranging from 17-42 nm.
NA,The results of this study can be used to design a coating which has co-optimized thickness for durability and nano-dimension for enhanced photocatalytic properties.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019.
NA,Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally.
NA,To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful.
NA,In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development.
NA,We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy - COVID-19.
NA,Several Italian towns are under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The level of transmission reduction required for physical distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a crucial question.
NA,We show that very high adherence to community quarantine (total stay-home policy) and a small household size is necessary for curbing the outbreak in a locked-down town.
NA,The larger the household size and amount of time in the public, the longer the lockdown period needed.
NA,With the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal, state, county, and city governments, universities, school districts, places of worship, prisons, health care facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares, homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission through built environment (BE)-mediated pathways.
NA,Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms.
NA,In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways.
NA,We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.
NA,With increasing numbers of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) cases due to efficient human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States, preparation for the unpredictable setting of labor and delivery is paramount.
NA,The priorities are two-fold in the management of obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection or persons under investigation (PUI): (1) caring for the range of asymptomatic to critically ill pregnant and postpartum women; (2) protecting health care workers and beyond from exposure during the delivery hospitalization (health care providers, personnel, family members).
NA,The goal of this review is to provide evidence-based recommendations, or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for anesthesiologists caring for pregnant women during the COVID 19 pandemic, with a focus on preparedness and best clinical obstetric anesthesia practice.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019.
NA,We re-analysed 640 throat swabs collected from patients in Wuhan with influenza-like-illness from 6 October 2019 to 21 January 2020 and found that 9 of the 640 throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative PCR, suggesting community transmission of SARS-CoV2 in Wuhan in early January 2020.
NA,COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China and is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV 2.
NA,It has now spread rapidly to over 190 countries and territories around the world and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
NA,The virus is spread through droplet transmission and currently has a mortality rate of over 4% globally.
NA,The pediatric population has been found to be less susceptible to the disease with the majority of children having milder symptoms and only one pediatric death being reported globally so far.
NA,Despite this, strategies need to be put in place to prevent further spread of the virus.
NA,We present a summary of the general measures implemented at a large adult and pediatric tertiary hospital in Singapore (National University Hospital) as well as the specific strategies in place for the operating room and pediatric intensive care unit.
NA,An epidemic of an acute respiratory syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), beginning in December 2019 has attracted an intense amount of attention worldwide.
NA,As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, the extrapulmonary symptoms of the disease have emerged, especially the symptoms related to the digestive system.
NA,While the respiratory mode of transmission is well-known and likely the principal mode of transmission of this disease, the possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenario.
NA,In this review article, we summarized the published literatures to date concerning four different aspects: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (b) microbiologic and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention/control infection in the digestive endoscopy room.
NA,A timely understanding of the relationship between the disease and the digestive system and implementing effective preventive measures are of great significance for a favorable outcome of the disease and can help mitigate further transmission by appropriate measures.

NA,The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization.
NA,The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission.
NA,This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012.
NA,COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world.
NA,The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities.
NA,Children are pauci- or asymptomatic.
NA,The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods.
NA,In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic.
NA,It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested.
NA,The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission.
NA,Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.
NA,La communauté internationale fait actuellement face à une pandémie de syndrome respiratoire aigu due à un nouveau coronavirus, le SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Ce syndrome a été nommé COVID-19 pour COronaVIrus Disease 2019 par l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé.
NA,Le point de départ de l’épidémie est la ville de Wuhan (Chine), où le virus aurait été transmis de l’animal à l’homme préalablement à la transmission inter-humaine.
NA,Il s’agit de la 3ème épidé¬mie causée par un coronavirus après celles du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SARS) en 2003 et du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (MERS) débutée en 2012.
NA,Le COVID-19 s’est rapidement propagé en Chine et se répand actuellement à travers le monde entier.
NA,L’infection touche surtout les patients de plus de 40 ans et la mortalité est accrue en présence de comorbidités.
NA,Les enfants sont, quant à eux, pauci- ou asymptomatiques.
NA,Le diagnostic repose, le plus souvent, sur la détection du génome viral au niveau du nasopharynx par des méthodes de biologie moléculaire.
NA,En l’absence de molécules anti-virales spéci¬fiques, le traitement reste, à l’heure actuelle, principalement symptomatique.
NA,Force est de constater que la pandémie de COVID-19 est plus difficile à contrôler que ce que les premières données ne laissaient présager.
NA,L’élément clé face au SARS-CoV-2 est de limiter sa transmission.
NA,Les mesures de prévention reposent, principalement, sur l’application de mesures d’hygiène des mains adéquates et la désinfection de l’environnement, ainsi que sur des mesures de distance sociale visant à limiter les contacts dans la population et à protéger les populations à risque.
NA,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, an increasing number of countries and territories are adopting restrictive measures based on physical (&quot;social&quot;) distancing, aimed at preventing human-to-human transmission and thereby limiting virus propagation.
NA,Nationwide lockdowns, encompassing mass quarantine under stay-at-home ordinances, have already been proven effective to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in some countries.
NA,Nevertheless, a prolonged homestay may also be associated with potential side effects, which may jeopardize people's health and thus must be recognized and mitigated in a way without violating local ordinances.
NA,Some of the most important undesirable consequences of prolonged homestay such as physical inactivity, weight gain, behavioral addiction disorders, insufficient sunlight exposure and social isolation will be critically addressed in this article, which also aims to provide some tentative recommendations for the alleviation of side effects.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.
NA,We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease.
NA,An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020.
NA,WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020.
NA,Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19.
NA,We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.
NA,Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%.
NA,Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently.
NA,One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment.
NA,We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use.
NA,We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS.
NA,Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis.
NA,Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low.
NA,Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence).
NA,Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS).
NA,Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS).
NA,When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence).
NA,Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19.
NA,Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge.
NA,Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness.
NA,In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented.
NA,Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions.
NA,This review was commissioned by WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of those global challenges that transcends territorial, political, ideological, religious, cultural, and certainly academic boundaries.
NA,Public health and healthcare workers are at the frontline, working to contain and to mitigate the spread of this disease.
NA,Although intervening biological and immunological responses against viral infection may seem far from the physical sciences and engineering that typically work with inanimate objects, there actually is much that can-and should-be done to help in this global crisis.
NA,In this Perspective, we convert the basics of infectious respiratory diseases and viruses into physical sciences and engineering intuitions, and through this exercise, we present examples of questions, hypotheses, and research needs identified based on clinicians' experiences.
NA,We hope researchers in the physical sciences and engineering will proactively study these challenges, develop new hypotheses, define new research areas, and work with biological researchers, healthcare, and public health professionals to create user-centered solutions and to inform the general public, so that we can better address the many challenges associated with the transmission and spread of infectious respiratory diseases.
NA,In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus elucidated as the aetiologic agent.
NA,Although most initial cases occurred in China, the disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a pandemic and continues to spread rapidly with human-to-human transmission in many countries.
NA,This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources.
NA,A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and healthcare resource burden.
NA,Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of COVID-19 cases develop severe or critical disease.
NA,This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in COVID-19 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality.
NA,In this article we discuss some of the peri-operative and critical care resource planning considerations and management strategies employed in a tertiary academic medical centre in Singapore in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Large numbers of healthcare workers have acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the workplace [1].
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmissible as each person with COVID-19 infects approximately 2.2 close contacts, and asymptomatic transmission has been reported [2,3].
NA,SARS-CoV-2 survives in aerosols and on surfaces from hours to days, respectively [4].
NA,Therefore, we believe non-clinical areas are potentially high-risk for transmission between healthcare workers, and often neglected by infection prevention and control protocols.
NA,To alert others to this risk and how it may be reduced, we describe our non-clinical workplace infection prevention and control measures that have been modified from those originally developed during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic [5].
NA,Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
NA,Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques.
NA,To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance.
NA,It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC.
NA,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
NA,Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
NA,Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
NA,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
NA,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
NA,A novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, and human-to-human transmission was previously identified.
NA,This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics in Jiangsu Province and assess whether so-called wartime control measures changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province.
NA,Epidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020.
NA,The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613.
NA,The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases.
NA,The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9.
NA,The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%-58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined.
NA,The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17.
NA,The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou.
NA,The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people).
NA,The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province.
NA,The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.
NA,The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined.
NA,This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.
NA,The first case of novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in November2019.
NA,The rapid progression to a global pandemic of COVID-19 has had profound medical, social, and economic consequences.
NA,Pregnant women and newborns represent a vulnerable population.
NA,However, the precise impact of this novel virus on the fetus and neonate remains uncertain.
NA,Appropriate protection of health care workers and newly born infants during and after delivery by a COVID-19 mother is essential.
NA,There is some disagreement among expert organizations on an optimal approach based on resource availability, surge volume, and potential risk of transmission.
NA,The manuscript outlines the precautions and steps to be taken before, during, and after resuscitation of a newborn born to a COVID-19 mother, including three optional variations of current standards involving shared-decision making with parents for perinatal management, resuscitation of the newborn, disposition, nutrition, and postdischarge care.
NA,The availability of resources may also drive the application of these guidelines.
NA,More evidence and research are needed to assess the risk of vertical and horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes.
NA,· The risk of vertical transmission is unclear; transmission from family members/providers to neonates is possible..
NA,· Optimal personal-protective-equipment (airborne vs. droplet/contact precautions) for providers is crucial to prevent transmission..
NA,· Parents should be engaged in shared decision-making with options for rooming in, skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding..
NA,COVID-19 a new respiratory infectious disease, has become an important public health problem.
NA,Inappropriate protection and disinfection measures are potential risk factors of transmission and outbreak of COVID-19 in key places.
NA,This theme issue is concerned with the prevention and control of COVID-19.
NA,Comprehensive measures and suggestions for protection and disinfection are put forward from perspectives of functional areas in key places, such as hotels, mobile cabin hospitals, passenger transport stations and public transport facilities, environment and facilities, personal protection, operation management system, etc., so as to provide technical support for the prevention and control of new respiratory infectious diseases.
NA,以新型冠状病毒肺炎为代表的新发呼吸道传染病传播与流行成为一个重要的公共卫生问题。

NA,Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, it has demonstrated China's ability to identify unknown pathogens.
NA,At present, reports showed that the main transmission routes are respiratory droplets and indirect contact, other vertical transmission routes have yet to be confirmed.
NA,This review discusses the possible transmission routes of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), based on currently research, the main transmission routes are respiratory droplets and indirect contact, fecal-oral might bepossible, while aerosol, tear (conjunctival) and mother-to-fetus still have yet to be confirmed, providing a reference basis for 2019-nCoV prevention and control and public protection.
NA,自2019年底，中国武汉暴发新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）肺炎以来，展现了我国对未知病原鉴定的能力。
NA,目前，报道的传播途径主要通过呼吸道飞沫和间接接触传播为主，其他传播途径还有待证实。
NA,本文讨论了2019-nCoV的可能传播途径，现有研究证实呼吸道的飞沫传播和接触传播是主要途径，粪口途径传播可能性比较大，气溶胶传播、泪液传播和母婴传播途径仍有待证实，为2019-nCoV的防控及公众防护提供参考依据。.
NA,Physical-distancing interventions are being used in Canada to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but it is not clear how effective they will be.
NA,We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system.
NA,We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada.
NA,We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing.
NA,Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds.
NA,We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon.
NA,We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case.
NA,At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU.
NA,For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect.
NA,Longer duration interventions were more effective.
NA,Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity.
NA,Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed.
NA,Dynamic physical distancing could maintain health-system capacity and also allow periodic psychological andeconomic respite for populations.
NA,Previous studies described the clinical features of Covid-19 in adults and infants under 1 year of age.
NA,Little is known about features, outcomes and intrauterine transmission potential in newborn babies aged 28 days or less.
NA,Through systematical searching, we identified 4 infections in newborn babies in China as of March 13.
NA,The age range was 30 h to 17 days old.
NA,Three were male.
NA,Two newborn babies had fever, 1 had shortness of breath, 1 had cough and 1 had no syndromes.
NA,Supportive treatment was provided for all 4 newborn babies.
NA,None required intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation.
NA,None had any severe complications.
NA,Three newborn babies recovered by the end of this study and had been discharged with 16, 23, and 30 days of hospital stay.
NA,All 4 mothers were infected by SARS-CoV-2, 3 showing symptoms before and 1 after delivery.
NA,Cesarean section was used for all 4 mothers, 3 at level III hospitals and 1 at a level II hospital.
NA,Three newborn babies were separated from mothers right after being born and were not breastfed.
NA,In summary, newborn babies are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The symptoms in newborn babies were milder and outcomes were less severe as compared to adults.
NA,Intrauterine vertical transmission is possible but direct evidence is still lacking.
NA,On Monday, 23 March 2020, Nigeria recorded its first mortality from the novel global COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Before this, the country reported 36 confirmed cases (at the time of writing) and has discharged home two cases after weeks of care at a government-approved isolation centre in Lagos State.
NA,This first mortality was that of a 67-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.
NA,He was undergoing chemotherapy and had just returned to Nigeria following medical treatment in the United Kingdom.
NA,The novel COVID-19 pandemic has grounded several global activities including the provision of health care services to people with chronic conditions such as cancer.
NA,Evidence from China suggests that cancer patients with COVID-19 infection are a vulnerable group, with a higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care unit admissions or death, particularly if they received chemotherapy or surgery.
NA,This letter is an attempt to suggest practicable interventions such as the use of existing digital health platforms to limit patients' and oncology professionals' physical interactions as a way of reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection transmission amongst cancer patients and oncologists, as well as outlining effective strategies to ensure that cancer care is not completely disrupted during the outbreak.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in nearly 1,000,000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 50,000 deaths.
NA,Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections.
NA,However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood.
NA,We comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than that of SARS-CoV.
NA,Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than that of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P&lt;0.024).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages.
NA,Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues.
NA,In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently.
NA,Our study provided the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues.
NA,Our results provided important insights on the pathogenesis, high transmissibility, and asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China.
NA,Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified.
NA,The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.
NA,The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces.
NA,As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702.
NA,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities.
NA,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
NA,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.
NA,WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.
NA,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1], and after a few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a global pandemic [2].
NA,Scientifically, the virus was named &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2) coronavirus&quot; [3].
NA,High-level endemic transmissions occurred in several countries, and while yet very limited, have spread in certain regions of the globe, particularly in Africa [4].

NA,Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives.
NA,Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a <i>global pandemic</i> by March of 2020.
NA,Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society.
NA,Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many.
NA,The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future.
NA,However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care.
NA,In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research.
NA,As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, the People's Republic of China, in December 2019 and now is a pandemic all around the world.
NA,Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19.
NA,We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan.
NA,A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices.
NA,To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted.
NA,A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19.
NA,The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%.
NA,The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic.
NA,The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%).
NA,There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%).
NA,Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12).
NA,Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]).
NA,Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15).
NA,Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19.
NA,Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Common places of work could be contaminated.
NA,Orthopaedic surgeons have to be more vigilant and take more precautions to avoid infection with COVID-19.
NA,Diagnostic Level IV.
NA,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
NA,On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
NA,As of February 29, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has reported 79,389 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 34 provinces.
NA,The masks can be used to block respiratory transmission from human to human, and are an effective way to control influenza.
NA,It is, therefore, necessary to wear a mask when respiratory infectious diseases are prevalent.
NA,China has a population of 1.4 billion.
NA,Assuming that two-thirds of the people in China must wear a mask every day, the daily demand for masks will reach 900 million.
NA,The Chinese government has taken many measures to solve these problems.
NA,Additionally, more measures should be taken to properly dispose of mask garbage.
NA,Although the outbreak originated in China, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, which means that it can be spread to anywhere in the world if prevention measures fail.
NA,The issues regarding face mask shortages and garbage in China, therefore, deserve worldwide attention.
NA,The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.
NA,COVID-19 is predominantly considered as an unavoidable pandemic, and scientists are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available.
NA,There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes.
NA,Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks.
NA,Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation.
NA,These masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well.
NA,In the absence of vaccination, productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases.
NA,The rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions.
NA,The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model.
NA,The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020.
NA,By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran.
NA,Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models.
NA,All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package.
NA,Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020.
NA,On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran.
NA,The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases.
NA,The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.
NA,Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China.
NA,Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus.
NA,The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast.
NA,Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy.
NA,In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care.
NA,Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection.
NA,In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.
NA,Presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might pose challenges for disease control.
NA,The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was detected on January 23, 2020, and by March 16, a total of 243 cases had been confirmed, including 157 locally acquired cases.
NA,Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred.
NA,Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19.
NA,Seven COVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases.
NA,In the four clusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient.
NA,To account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset.
NA,Evidence of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the critical role social distancing, including avoidance of congregate settings, plays in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,On February 27, 2020, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) identified its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with probable community transmission (i.e., infection among persons without a known exposure by travel or close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19).
NA,At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1).
NA,To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County.
NA,During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites.
NA,For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers.
NA,A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza.
NA,Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection.
NA,This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County.
NA,As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies.
NA,Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2).
NA,Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.
NA,In the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area, where the first case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the United States was reported (1), a community-level outbreak is ongoing with evidence of rapid spread and high morbidity and mortality among older adults in long-term care skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (2,3).
NA,However, COVID-19 morbidity among residents of senior independent and assisted living communities, in which residents do not live as closely together as do residents in SNFs and do not require skilled nursing services, has not been described.
NA,During March 5-9, 2020, two residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented in the community.
NA,UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility.
NA,On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later.
NA,Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%) had positive test results.
NA,The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved.
NA,A fourth resident, who had negative test results in the initial phase, had positive test results 7 days later.
NA,This resident was asymptomatic on both days.
NA,Possible explanations for so few cases of COVID-19 in this residential community compared with those in several Seattle SNFs with high morbidity and mortality include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers.
NA,In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting.
NA,When investigating a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in senior independent and assisted living communities, symptom screening is unlikely to be sufficient to identify all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Adherence to CDC guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission in senior independent and assisted living communities (4) could be instrumental in preventing a facility outbreak.
NA,As of April 2, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in &gt;890,000 cases and &gt;45,000 deaths worldwide, including 239,279 cases and 5,443 deaths in the United States (1,2).
NA,In the United States, 22% of the population is made up of infants, children, and adolescents aged &lt;18 years (children) (3).
NA,Data from China suggest that pediatric COVID-19 cases might be less severe than cases in adults and that children might experience different symptoms than do adults (4,5); however, disease characteristics among pediatric patients in the United States have not been described.
NA,Data from 149,760 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States occurring during February 12-April 2, 2020 were analyzed.
NA,Among 149,082 (99.6%) reported cases for which age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) were among children aged &lt;18 years.
NA,Data were available for a small proportion of patients on many important variables, including symptoms (9.4%), underlying conditions (13%), and hospitalization status (33%).
NA,Among those with available information, 73% of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath compared with 93% of adults aged 18-64 years during the same period; 5.7% of all pediatric patients, or 20% of those for whom hospitalization status was known, were hospitalized, lower than the percentages hospitalized among all adults aged 18-64 years (10%) or those with known hospitalization status (33%).
NA,Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in this analysis.
NA,These data support previous findings that children with COVID-19 might not have reported fever or cough as often as do adults (4).
NA,Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group.
NA,Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission (6,7).
NA,Few case reports and clinical series exist on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered.
NA,To review the available information on mode of delivery, vertical/peripartum transmission, and neonatal outcome in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and pregnancy in Embase and PubMed databases.
NA,Papers reporting cases of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered.
NA,The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes.
NA,In the 13 studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3).
NA,Indication for cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3).
NA,Two newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported.
NA,In three neonates, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels were elevated but the RT-PCR test was negative.
NA,The rate of vertical or peripartum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low, if any, for cesarean delivery; no data are available for vaginal delivery.
NA,Low frequency of spontaneous preterm birth and general favorable immediate neonatal outcome are reassuring.
NA,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic.
NA,Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission.
NA,Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key.
NA,ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management.
NA,Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed.
NA,Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies.
NA,Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.
NA,In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020.
NA,It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19).
NA,We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks.
NA,We included 16 of 616 identified articles.
NA,School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19.
NA,However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control.
NA,Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic.
NA,Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results.
NA,Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2-4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.
NA,Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered.
NA,Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.
NA,The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease has gripped the entire international community and caused widespread public health concerns.
NA,Despite global efforts to contain the disease spread, the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection.
NA,This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins and later transmitted to humans.
NA,Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature.
NA,Dental professionals, including endodontists, may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection.
NA,Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection.
NA,In addition, specific recommendations for dental practice are suggested for patient screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.
NA,A novel coronavirus (CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), results in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance.
NA,There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions.
NA,During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare.
NA,Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care.
NA,Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched.
NA,Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal.
NA,Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided.
NA,Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners could consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available).
NA,Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).
NA,Pediatric coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) infection is relatively mild when compared to adults, and children are reported to have a better prognosis.
NA,Mortality in children appears rare.
NA,Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute to transmission.
NA,It remains unclear why children and young adults are less severely affected than older individuals, but this might involve differences in immune system function in the elderly and/or differences in the expression/function of the cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
NA,Laboratory findings and chest imaging may not be specific in children with COVID-19.
NA,Diagnosis is by Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of upper or lower respiratory tract secretions.
NA,This review additionally considers COVID-19 in immunosuppressed children, and also suggests a management algorithm for the few children who appear to present with life threatening infection, including the potential use of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment.
NA,The most significant threat to global child health from SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be related to COVID 19 in children, but rather the socio-economic consequences of a prolonged pandemic.
NA,The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection has become a challenging public health threat worldwide.
NA,Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,We report a case of a convalescing pregnant woman diagnosed as COVID-19 infection 37 days before delivery in the third trimester.
NA,A live birth without SARS-CoV-2 infection was delivered successfully via the vagina.
NA,Findings from our case indicate that there is no intrauterine transmission in this woman who develops COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

NA,The conjunctival mucosa is directly exposed to infectious droplets expelled by patients during close contact and fomites when the eye is touched by contaminated hands.<sup>2, 3</sup> More over, the mucosa of the conjunctiva and upper respiratory tract is connected by nasolacrimal duct, and share the same entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on host cell membranes.<sup>2, 3</sup> Hence, it is reasonable to postulate that the conjunctiva may be easily involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may even act as a route of transmission during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

NA,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), spreading from Wuhan, China, is one of the causes of respiratory infections that can spread to other people through respiratory particles, and can cause symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anorexia, fatigue and sore throat in infected patients.
NA,This review summarizes current strategies on the diagnosis.
NA,Additionally, treatments, infection prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 are addressed.
NA,In addition to the respiratory system, this virus can infect the digestive system, the urinary system and the haematological system, which causes to observe the virus in the stool, urine and blood samples in addition to throat sample.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 causes changes in blood cells and factors and makes lung abnormalities in patients, which can be detected by serological, molecular, and radiological techniques by detecting these changes and injuries.
NA,Radiological and serological methods are the most preferred among the other methods and the radiological method is the most preferred one which can diagnose the infection quickly and accurately with fewer false-negatives, that can be effective in protecting the patient's life by initiating treatment and preventing the transmission of infection to other people.
NA,In late December 2019, reports from China of the incidence of pneumonia with unknown etiology were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,Shortly afterwards, the cause of this disease was identified as the novel beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its genetic sequence was published on January 12, 2020.
NA,Human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets and contact with aerosol infected surfaces are the major ways of transmitting this virus.
NA,Here we attempted to collect information on virus stability in the air and on surfaces and ways of preventing of SARS-CoV-2 spreading.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is serious and has the potential to become an epidemic worldwide.
NA,Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue.
NA,However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations.
NA,To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19.
NA,This is a retrospective, observational case series.
NA,Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.
NA,The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
NA,Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists.
NA,Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations.
NA,Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status.
NA,Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations.
NA,Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough.
NA,Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).
NA,Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations.
NA,During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak.
NA,To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions.
NA,In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification.
NA,Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey.
NA,Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey).
NA,The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods.
NA,Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women.
NA,The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase.
NA,The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]).
NA,The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods.
NA,The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (&lt;20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]).
NA,The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.
NA,A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.
NA,These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
NA,With more than 900,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50,000 deaths during the first three months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis.
NA,The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases.
NA,For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment.
NA,While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances.
NA,Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints.
NA,To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints.
NA,Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide.
NA,The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.
NA,Clusters of patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been successively reported globally.
NA,Studies show clear person-to-person transmission.
NA,The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days.
NA,However, in some patients, this period may be longer.
NA,Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a 47-year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14-day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan.
NA,Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.
NA,· Second stage of labor exposes providers to aerosol..
NA,· COVID-19 risk during second stage of labor is high..
NA,· N95 should be used during second stage of labor..
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast and is affecting the clinical workers at much higher risk than the general population.
NA,Little is known about COVID-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease.
NA,In light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is an aggressive attempt at conservation.
NA,In obstetrics, the guidelines on PPE use are controversial and differ among hospitals, globally, as well as nationally.
NA,The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommend using N95 respirators, which are respirators that offer a higher level of protection instead of a facemask for when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedures (AGP).
NA,However, the second stage of labor is not considered an AGP.
NA,The second stage of labor can last up to 4 hours.
NA,During that time, labor and delivery personnel is in close contact to patients, who are exerting extreme effort during and frequently blow out their breath, cough, shout, and vomit, all of which put the health care team at risk, considering that COVID-19 transmission occurs through aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing.
NA,The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not provide clarification on the use of N95 during the second stage.
NA,We recommend that labor and delivery personnel have the utmost caution and be granted the protection they need to protect themselves and other patients.
NA,This includes providing labor and delivery personnel full PPE including N95 for the second stage of labor.
NA,This is critical to ensure the adequate protection for health care workers and to prevent spread to other health care workers and patients.
NA,The COVID-19 epidemic, which is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly to become a world-wide pandemic.
NA,Chest radiography and chest CT are frequently used to support the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
NA,However, multiple cases of COVID-19 transmission in radiology department have been reported.
NA,Here we summarize the lessons we learned and provide suggestions to improve the infection control and prevention practices of healthcare workers in departments of radiology.
NA,The novel COVID-19 pandemic has placed medical triage decision-making in the spotlight.
NA,As life-saving ventilators become scarce, clinicians are being forced to allocate scarce resources in even the wealthiest countries.
NA,The pervasiveness of air travel and high rate of transmission has caused this pandemic to spread swiftly throughout the world.
NA,Ethical triage decisions are commonly based on the utilitarian approach of maximising total benefits and life expectancy.
NA,We present triage guidelines from Italy, USA and the UK as well as the Jewish ethical prospective on medical triage.
NA,The Jewish tradition also recognises the utilitarian approach but there is disagreement between the rabbis whether human discretion has any role in the allocation of scarce resources and triage decision-making.
NA,Little is known about the perinatal aspects of COVID-19.
NA,To summarize available evidence and provide perinatologists/neonatologists with tools for managing their patients.
NA,Analysis of available literature on COVID-19 using Medline and Google scholar.
NA,From scant data: vertical transmission from maternal infection during the third trimester probably does not occur or likely it occurs very rarely.
NA,Consequences of COVID-19 infection among women during early pregnancy remain unknown.
NA,We cannot conclude if pregnancy is a risk factor for more severe disease in women with COVID-19.
NA,Little is known about disease severity in neonates, and from very few samples, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented in human milk.
NA,Links to websites of organizations with updated COVID-19 information are provided.
NA,Infographics summarize an approach to the pregnant woman or neonate with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
NA,As the pandemic continues, more data will be available that could lead to changes in current knowledge and recommendations.
NA,The coronavirus (COVID-19) has challenged health professions and systems and has evoked different speeds of reaction and types of response around the world.
NA,The role of dental professionals in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 is critically important.
NA,While all routine dental care has been suspended in countries experiencing COVID-19 disease during the period of pandemic, the need for organised urgent care delivered by teams provided with appropriate personal protective equipment takes priority.
NA,Dental professionals can also contribute to medical care.
NA,Major and rapid reorganisation of both clinical and support services is not straightforward.
NA,Dental professionals felt a moral duty to reduce routine care for fear of spreading COVID-19 among their patients and beyond, but were understandably concerned about the financial consequences.
NA,Amidst the explosion of information available online and through social media, it is difficult to identify reliable research evidence and guidance, but moral decisions must be made.
NA,In order to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, healthcare workers in the UK are advised to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,When undertaking aerosol-generating procedures, Public Health England recommends the use of gloves, gown, filtering mask and full-face visor or goggles .
NA,Despite this, uncertainty remains regarding the role of some items of PPE, such as hoods and visors .
NA,On 07/02/2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps.
NA,We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission.
NA,We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive RT-PCR sample for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%).
NA,One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic.
NA,One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case.
NA,Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, one tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative.
NA,Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored, including 73 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The occurrence in this cluster of one asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient, suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals.
NA,The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children.
NA,Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspect Covid-19 cases.
NA,The possibility of mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is currently a highly debated concept in perinatal medicine.
NA,It has implications for the mother, fetus, and neonate, as well as for healthcare providers present at the time of birth and caring for the child during the neonatal period, including obstetricians, midwives, family doctors, anesthetists, pediatricians, neonatologists, nurses, and respiratory therapists.
NA,At present the evidence for intrauterine transmission from mother to fetus or intrapartum transmission from mother to the neonate is sparse.
NA,There are limitations associated with sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests used and classification of patients based on test results has also been questioned.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency.
NA,An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported.
NA,Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea.
NA,We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.
NA,It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms.
NA,A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%.
NA,SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
NA,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia.
NA,ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.
NA,Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation.
NA,Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms.
NA,The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.
NA,The purpose of this paper is to reveal the spread rules of the three pneumonia: COVID-19, SARS and MERS.
NA,We compare the new spread characteristics of COVID-19 with those of SARS and MERS.
NA,By considering the growth rate and inhibition constant of infectious diseases, their propagation growth model is established.
NA,The parameters of the three coronavirus transmission growth models are obtained by nonlinear fitting.
NA,Parametric analysis shows that the growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of the SARS and MERS, and the COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days, suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human intervention.
NA,The infection inhibition constant in Hubei is two orders of magnitude lower than in other regions, which reasonably explains the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei.
NA,Paediatric otolaryngology practice involves examining and operating in anatomical locations with high levels of aerosol generation and transmission of COVID-19 to treating clinicians, especially from the asymptomatic patient populations including children.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic all emergent otolaryngological conditions affecting the airway, oral, and nasal cavities should be managed medically where possible and any operating deferred.
NA,We present guidelines for operating on paediatric otolaryngological patients when necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic, and incorporate experience gathered during microlaryngobronchoscopy on a COVID-19 positive infant at our institution.
NA,Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Spain in February 2020, with 216% intensive care unit (ICU) capacity expanded in Vitoria by March 18<sup>th</sup>, 2020.
NA,We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Data reported here were available in March 31th, 2020.
NA,Mortality was assessed in those who completed 7-days of ICU stay.
NA,We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51-75] years.
NA,Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission.
NA,The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (n = 48%), arterial hypertension (n = 44%) and chronic lung disease (n = 37%).
NA,All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation.
NA,Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 HFNT, 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (49%) required prone position.
NA,After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation.
NA,Six patients had documented co-infection.
NA,Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5 µg/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p = 0.78) risk of death after 7 days.
NA,This early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving.
NA,Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation.
NA,After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, better known as COVID-19 has become the current health concern to the entire world.
NA,Initially appeared in Wuhan, China around December 2019, it had spread to almost 187 countries due to its high contagious nature.
NA,Precautionary measures remain the sole obliging tactic to cease the person to person transmissions till any effective method of treatment or vaccine is developed.
NA,Amidst the pandemic, research and development of new molecule is labour-intensive and tedious process.
NA,Drug repurposing is the concept of identifying therapeutically potent molecule from the library of pre-existing molecules.
NA,In the present study, 61 molecules that are already being used in clinics or under clinical scrutiny as antiviral agents are surveyed via docking study.
NA,Docking study was performed using Maestro interface (Schrödinger Suite, LLC, NY).
NA,Out of these 61 molecules, 37 molecules were found to interact with &gt;2 protein structures of COVID-19.
NA,The docking results indicate that amongst the reported molecules, HIV protease inhibitors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors showed promising features of binding to COVID-19 enzyme.
NA,Along with these, Methisazone an inhibitor of protein synthesis, CGP42112A an angiotensin AT2 receptor agonist and ABT450 an inhibitor of the non-structural protein 3-4A might become convenient treatment option as well against COVID-19.
NA,The drug repurposing approach provide an insight about the therapeutics that might be helpful in treating corona virus disease.
NA,Hospitals have severely curtailed the performance of non-urgent surgical procedures in anticipation of the need to redeploy healthcare resources to meet the projected massive medical needs of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Surgical treatment of non-COVID-19 related disease during this period, however, still remains necessary.
NA,The decision to proceed with Medically-Necessary, Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making.
NA,We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns.
NA,This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) in the midst of the pandemic and may be able to inform case triage as OR capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread outside the initial epicenter of Wuhan.
NA,We compared cases in Guangzhou and Wuhan to illustrate potential changes in pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics as the epidemic has progressed.
NA,We studied 20 patients admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China from January 22 to February 12, 2020.
NA,Data were extracted from medical records.
NA,These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020.
NA,Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients.
NA,The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%).
NA,Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more clustered.
NA,Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces.
NA,Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients.
NA,This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission.
NA,Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices.
NA,We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management.
NA,We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;pathogenesis&quot;, &quot;incubation period&quot;, &quot;transmission&quot;, &quot;clinical features&quot;, &quot;diagnosis&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, with interposition of the Boolean operator &quot;AND&quot;.
NA,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death.
NA,Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality.
NA,Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19.
NA,No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.
NA,Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects.
NA,Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.
NA,Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management.
NA,No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence.
NA,Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), though primarily a respiratory pathogen, also involves the gastrointestinal tract.
NA,Similar to the respiratory mucosa, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2) co-express in the gastrointestinal tract, which facilitates viral entry into the tissue.
NA,Less than 10% of children with infection develop diarrhea and vomiting.
NA,Prolonged RT PCR positivity in the stool has raised the possibility of feco-oral transmission.
NA,Elevated transaminases are common, especially in those with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID -19) disease.
NA,Children with inflammatory bowel disease and post liver transplant patients do not have an increased risk of disease, and should remain on medications they are already on.
NA,Children with chronic liver disease should continue their medications as usual.
NA,All elective procedures like endoscopy should be postponed.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease emerged in China in late 2019-early 2020 and it is spreading rapidly worldwide (1).
NA,Amongst the Spanish public health interventions aimed at reducing the transmission rate, home confinement has been enforced (2).
NA,The Royal Decree 463/2020 stated a 15-day national emergency states starting on March 15, that has since been extended (3).
NA,Rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
NA,Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste.
NA,Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases.
NA,A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid-19.
NA,Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity.
NA,A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020.
NA,Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) Covid-19-negative patients.
NA,Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid-19-negative patients (p&lt;0.001).
NA,Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95%CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11-0.50).
NA,Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness.
NA,In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with Covid-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms.
NA,Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms.

NA,Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic of respiratory illness, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[
NA,1] The risk of developing COVID-19 from a SARS-CoV-2 infected organ donor is unknown.
NA,Therefore, extreme caution is necessary when considering transplantation.
NA,Transmission is affected by epidemiological risk factors, incubation period, degree of viraemia, and viability of SARS-CoV-2 in blood and organ compartments.
NA,Recent guidelines from NHSBT[2] recommend that all potential donors be tested for SARS-CoV-2 and donation suspended from those who test positive.
NA,Donation is discouraged for asymptomatic individuals who have been in a COVID-19-affected area in the last 28 days.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 may present with respiratory syndromes indistinguishable from common viruses.
NA,This poses a challenge for early detection during triage at the emergency department (ED).
NA,Over a 3-month period, our ED aimed to minimise nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers (HCWs) METHODS: All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3-month period were tested for COVID-19.
NA,The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 was assessed.
NA,A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high-risk &quot;fever areas&quot; and lower-risk zones.
NA,When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs.
NA,A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period.
NA,Amongst these, 70 cases of COVID-19 were subsequently confirmed.
NA,The majority (84.2%, 59/70) were picked up at ED triage as they fulfilled suspect case criteria.
NA,Of these, 34 met the official screening criteria; another 25 were picked up by the broader internal screening criteria.
NA,Over the 12-week period, the cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria was 84.3% (95% confidence interval, CI=73.6%-91.9%), whereas the sensitivity of the official screening criteria was 48.6% (95%CI=36.4%- 60.8%).
NA,Given the broadened internal criteria, the pre-existing ED &quot;fever area&quot; was insufficient and had to be expanded.
NA,However, there were no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra-ED exposure, despite extensive surveillance.
NA,Frontline physicians need to be given leeway to decide on the disposition of cases based on clinical suspicion during an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,If a broader criterion is used at ED triage, ED facilities and isolation facilities need to be readied to accommodate a surge of suspect cases.
NA,Usage of appropriate PPE is essential in minimising nosocomial transmission.
NA,Brain-eating amoebae are known to harbor a plethora of viral, bacterial, protozoal, and fungal pathogens and safeguard these pathogens against disinfectants.
NA,Due to their ubiquitous distribution in the environment and their status as the trojan horse of the microbial world, amoebae can provide novel coronavirus a means to susceptible hosts and possible transmission to the central nervous system.
NA,Here, we hypothesize that pursuing the host that harbor &quot;terror cells&quot; is a valuable approach in eradicating novel coronavirus in affected communities.
NA,To improve the infection control and prevention practices against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in radiology department through loophole identification and providing rectifying measurements.
NA,Retrospective analysis of 2 cases of health-care-associated COVID-19 transmission in 2 radiology departments and comparing the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 with the practices of our department, where no COVID-19 transmission has occurred.
NA,Several loopholes have been identified in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments.
NA,Loopholes were in large part due to our limited understanding of the highly contagious coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is characterized by features not observed in other SARS viruses.
NA,We recommend to set up an isolation zone for handling patients who do not meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 but are not completely cleared of the possibility of infection.
NA,Loopholes in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments are due to poor understanding of the emerging disease which can be fixed by establishing an isolation zone for patients not completely cleared of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Coronavirus (CoV) is the single stranded sense RNA virus that has been known so far with the largest genomic capacity and plenty of natural hosts.
NA,In the past dozens of years, SARS-CoV under the branch of the new evolutionary tree has threatens greatly global public health and the severe acute respiratory syndrome new coronavirus (COVID-19) reported in China could cause fatal pathological lesions.
NA,Especially in areas with poor medical care, neglect of indirect transmission can cause more serious consequences.
NA,First of all, with reference to SARS-CoV and other relevant studies, the possibility of virus residues on the surface of multiple media is discussed.
NA,Further, it is found that the surface residue of this substance may be an important factor in iatrogenic infection.
NA,This correspondence could point out the direction to study the pathomechanism of COVID-19 infecting human beings.
NA,Mucosa exposure and inappropriate treatment of medical and non-medical articles used by the patients all could increase the risks of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,A new coronavirus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China, named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and disease was called as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across &gt;205 nations, including the United States (US).
NA,Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally.
NA,Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors.
NA,While multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as Hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature.
NA,COVID-19 predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence showed that shedding in feces and feco-oral transmission could also be possible.
NA,It is unclear if COVID-19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids.
NA,GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions.
NA,This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission.
NA,Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non-urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent based on the clinical need.
NA,Furthermore, pre-screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended.
NA,This article focuses on the risk of COVID-19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus including transmission during endoscopies and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopy procedures.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an epidemic in China and many other countries.
NA,Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited.
NA,In this retrospective case series, we enrolled 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their household members in Wuhan.
NA,Patients were confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on throat swabs.
NA,Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of the household members were collected.
NA,There were 155 close contacts in total. 104 contacts received RT-PCR assays, with 47 (30%) positive cases and 57 (37%) negative cases. 51 (33%) cases did not received RT-PCR tests for they showed no symptoms of pneumonia during the 2 weeks of quarantine.
NA,The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts.
NA,The rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 30%.
NA,Our data provide insight into the rate of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in home.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to many places outside Wuhan.
NA,Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults.
NA,Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available.
NA,A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced.
NA,Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16-23] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19.
NA,Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21.
NA,He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21.
NA,His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively.
NA,Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index.
NA,None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months.
NA,For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1-4).
NA,The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0-4).
NA,Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission.
NA,All patients had mild conditions.
NA,Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission.
NA,As of February 20, four patients were discharged.
NA,SARS-CoV-2-infection presented strong infectivity during the incubation-period with rapid transmission in this cluster of youngsters outside Wuhan.
NA,COVID-19 developed in these youngsters had fast onset and various nonspecific atypical manifestations, and were much milder than in older patients as previously reported.
NA,Severe infection involving the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that subsequently requires patients to be intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation.
NA,In the setting of the recent pandemic, there is a greater need to perform tracheostomy for these patients.
NA,With the high transmissibility of the virus, there has been an increasing concern for the development of techniques to perform surgical intervention while mitigating the risk for infecting hospital staff.
NA,As more data emerge pertaining to viral shedding in various bodily fluids, it has become more important to give special attention to precautions.
NA,In this article, we submit a novel approach for better protection and thus reduced transmission for tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient.
NA,Importantly, this technique is functional, easy to set up, and can be used for additional operations that involve risk of aerosolization or droplet exposure to operating room staff.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic threat to the whole world.
NA,At the same time, influenza virus has been active, with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 sharing the same transmission routes.
NA,This article aims to alert clinicians of the presence of co-infection with these two viruses and to describe the effect of the measures taken to fight COVID-19 on influenza prevention and control.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, in late 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world.
NA,The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments.
NA,Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19.
NA,We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020.
NA,To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h.
NA,Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO<sub>2</sub>, relative humidity and temperature were recorded throughout the sampling duration.
NA,Viral RNA was extracted from samples taken from the impingers and Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was applied to confirm the positivity of collected samples based on the virus genome sequence.
NA,Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients' beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative.
NA,Despite we indicated that all air samples were negative, however, we suggest further in vivo experiments should be conducted using actual patient cough, sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols.
NA,The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know.
NA,We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics.
NA,Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting.
NA,However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 shares both high sequence similarity and the use of the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
NA,Several studies have provided bioinformatic evidence of potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems.
NA,However, whether the reproductive system is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined.
NA,Here, we investigate the expression pattern of ACE2 in adult human testes at the level of single-cell transcriptomes.
NA,The results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells.
NA,Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicates that Gene Ontology (GO) categories associated with viral reproduction and transmission are highly enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia, while male gamete generation related terms are downregulated.
NA,Cell-cell junction and immunity-related GO terms are increased in ACE2-positive Leydig and Sertoli cells, but mitochondria and reproduction-related GO terms are decreased.
NA,These findings provide evidence that the human testis is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have significant impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of this rapidly spreading disease.
NA,Currently, it is commonly reported that COVID-19 patients are associated with conjunctival congestion and other symptoms, and the transmission route or high-risk diseases of ophthalmology and high-risk working status are speculated.
NA,Are conjunctival congestion or conjunctival related symptoms in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus definitely related the novel coronavirus?
NA,Conjunctival congestion is one of the common clinical signs of various types of conjunctivitis.
NA,The symptoms and signs of conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients may be related to a variety of factors.
NA,Therefore, conjunctival symptoms should not be associated with 2019 novel coronavirus without evidence. <i>( Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56: )</i>.
NA,目前常见将新型冠状病毒肺炎患者与其结膜充血等症状联系在一起并对传播途径或眼科高危病种及高危工作状态进行猜测的报道。
NA,新型冠状病毒感染患者出现结膜充血或与结膜相关的症状等，一定与新型冠状病毒有关吗？
NA,本文指出结膜充血是各种类型结膜炎的共同临床体征之一，新型冠状病毒感染患者出现了结膜炎的症状和体征，可能与多种因素相关，因此不应在无证据的情况下，将结膜症状与新型冠状病毒联系在一起。
NA,<i>（中华眼科杂志，2020，56：）</i>.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,The infection has predominantly respiratory transmission and is transmitted through large droplets or aerosols, and less commonly by contact with infected surfaces or fomites.
NA,The alarming spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease that it may cause have led to the widespread institution of social distancing measures.
NA,Because of repeated exposure to potentially infectious patients and specimens, health care and laboratory personnel are particularly susceptible to contract COVID-19.
NA,This review paper provides an assessment of the current state of knowledge about the disease and its pathology, and the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens.
NA,It also discusses the measures that cytology laboratories can take to function during the pandemic, and minimize the risk to their personnel, trainees, and pathologists.
NA,In addition, it explores potential means to continue to educate trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,We report epidemiological and clinical investigations on ten pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection cases confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Symptoms in these cases were nonspecific and no children required respiratory support or intensive care.
NA,Chest X-rays lacked definite signs of pneumonia, a defining feature of the infection in adult cases.
NA,Notably, eight children persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, raising the possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
NA,Among surgeons worldwide, a concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques has been raised due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) with the creation of pneumoperitoneum.
NA,Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed.
NA,We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic.
NA,Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic.
NA,There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission.
NA,Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.
NA,The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers and increase the current knowledge on the perinatal consequences of COVID-19.
NA,Nineteen neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 31 to February 29, 2020.
NA,Their mothers were clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19.
NA,We prospectively collected and analyzed data of mothers and infants.
NA,There are 19 neonates included in the research.
NA,Among them, 10 mothers were confirmed COVID-19 by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, and 9 mothers were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,Delivery occurred in an isolation room and neonates were immediately separated from the mothers and isolated for at least 14 days.
NA,No fetal distress was found.
NA,Gestational age of the neonates was 38.6 ± 1.5 weeks, and average birth weight was 3293 ± 425 g.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, urine, and feces of all neonates were negative.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in breast milk and amniotic fluid was negative too.
NA,None of the neonates developed clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19.
NA,No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no perinatal complications in the third trimester were found in our study.
NA,The delivery should occur in isolation and neonates should be separated from the infected mothers and care givers.
NA,Coronaviruses cause disease in animals and people around the world.
NA,Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive systems.
NA,Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV.
NA,The most common symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%).
NA,The best prevention is to avoid exposure.
NA,In addition, contact persons should be subjected to mandatory quarantine.
NA,COVID-19 patients should be treated in specialist centers.
NA,A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy.
NA,Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases.
NA,A lung-saving ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanically ventilated patients.
NA,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable to a significant number of cases.
NA,Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available.
NA,Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.
NA,The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unfolded with remarkable speed, posing unprecedented challenges for health care systems and society.
NA,Otolaryngologists have a special role in responding to this crisis by virtue of expertise in airway management.
NA,Against the backdrop of nations struggling to contain the virus's spread and to manage hospital strain, otolaryngologists must partner with anesthesiologists and front-line health care teams to provide expert services in high-risk situations while reducing transmission.
NA,Airway management and airway endoscopy, whether awake or sedated, expose operators to infectious aerosols, posing risks to staff.
NA,This commentary provides background on the outbreak, highlights critical considerations around mitigating infectious aerosol contact, and outlines best practices for airway-related clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,What otolaryngologists need to know and what actions are required are considered alongside the implications of increasing demand for tracheostomy.
NA,Approaches to managing the airway are presented, emphasizing safety of patients and the health care team.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus resulting in high mortality in the adult population but low mortality in the pediatric population.
NA,The role children and adolescents play in COVID-19 transmission is unclear, and it is possible that healthy pediatric patients serve as a reservoir for the virus.
NA,This article serves as a summary of a single pediatric institution's response to COVID-19 with the goal of protecting both patients and health care providers while providing ongoing care to critically ill patients who require urgent interventions.
NA,A significant limitation of this commentary is that it reflects a single institution's joint effort at a moment in time but does not take into consideration future circumstances that could change practice patterns.
NA,We still hope dissemination of our overall response at this moment, approximately 8 weeks after our region's first adult case, may benefit other pediatric institutions preparing for COVID-19.
NA,During the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemiological data is essential for controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations.
NA,Following Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier.
NA,As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named &quot;one-net management&quot; on dynamic information monitoring.
NA,By sharing epidemiological data with medical institutions under a safe environment, we believe that the ability to prevent and control epidemics among medical institutions will be effectively and comprehensively improved.
NA,The initial investigation by local hospital attributed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to pneumonia with unknown cause that appeared like the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
NA,The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries.
NA,Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate.
NA,This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases.
NA,We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China.
NA,Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission.
NA,We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity.
NA,We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths.
NA,Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China.
NA,We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases.
NA,The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI).
NA,Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases.
NA,Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.
NA,We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.
NA,Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a considerable risk during emergency colorectal surgery in a pandemic epicenter.
NA,It is well known that the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is through respiratory droplets.
NA,However, little is known about shedding of the virus in bodily fluids and associated risks.
NA,Although the current moratorium on elective surgery addresses multiple ongoing concerns, including the management of precious resources as well as unknown exposure risks, surgeons undeniably must face and mitigate risks related to exposure to patient airway management-related aerosols, bodily fluids, surgical smoke, contaminated insufflation, and specimen handling in emergency colorectal surgery.
NA,Given the significant concern of airborne transmission, the authors recommend conventional, in lieu of laparoscopic, access in emergency colorectal surgery in a COVID-19 pandemic epicenter.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 in China has attracted wide attention from all over the world.
NA,The impact of COVID-19 has been significant, raising concerns regarding public health risks in China and worldwide.
NA,Migration may be the primary reason for the long-distance transmission of the disease.
NA,In this study, the following analyses were performed.
NA,(1) Using the data from the China migrant population survey in 2017 (Sample size = 432,907), a matrix of the residence-birthplace (R-B matrix) of migrant populations is constructed.
NA,The matrix was used to analyze the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Prefecture-level Cities from February 1-15, 2020 after the outbreak in Wuhan, by calculating the probability of influx or outflow migration.
NA,We obtain a satisfactory regression analysis result (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.826-0.887, <i>N</i> = 330).
NA,(2) We use this R-B matrix to simulate an outbreak scenario in 22 immigrant cities in China, and propose risk prevention measures after the outbreak.
NA,If similar scenarios occur in the cities of Wenzhou, Guangzhou, Dongguan, or Shenzhen, the disease transmission will be wider.
NA,(3) We also use a matrix to determine that cities in Henan province, Anhui province, and Municipalities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing) in China will have a high risk level of disease carriers after a similar emerging epidemic outbreak scenario due to a high influx or outflow of migrant populations.
NA,It is urgent to understand the future of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission.
NA,We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from time series data from the USA to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave.
NA,Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded.
NA,To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022.
NA,Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity.
NA,Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.
NA,In December 2019 a new human coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, which is known as SARS-CoV‑2.
NA,The clinical course of the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung failure.
NA,The virus is currently rapidly spreading around the world and pushing health systems to the limits of their capacity due to the exponential increase in the number of cases.
NA,The origin of SARS-CoV‑2 lies in the bat coronavirus pool and has now emerged in the human population due to interspecies transmission.
NA,Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time and a number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing.
NA,The development of a vaccine using different approaches is also under investigation.Considering the high number of cases and mortality rates of up to 9% there is an urgent need for action.
NA,This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on human coronaviruses with a strong focus on the current data on SARS-CoV‑2.
NA,Due to the daily changing level of knowledge, the article reflects the status up to 21 March 2020.
NA,The whole world is going through an unprecedented period during the pandemic of COVID-19.
NA,This pandemic has affected all aspects of daily life with far-reaching implications, especially in most aspects of healthcare.
NA,Practice of surgery across the globe is in a standstill as of now.
NA,When we restart surgical practices across world, we have to bring new protocols and practices in place to combat the transmission.
NA,This article discusses the major changes in surgical practice, which need to be brought in.
NA,This article is based on scientific information about transmission of virus and experiences of some of the authors from China, a country which successfully dealt with and contained the virus outbreak.
NA,The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to international health system and economy.
NA,This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.
NA,The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes.
NA,The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks.
NA,The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19.
NA,During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%.
NA,The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age.
NA,The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12.
NA,There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R<sup>2</sup>=0.996).
NA,The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide.
NA,It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends.
NA,The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe.
NA,However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.
NA,COVID-2019 emerged from China in late December.
NA,It follows two other coronavirus outbreaks, the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
NA,Coronaviruses usually circulate among animals but sometimes can jump to humans.
NA,These three strains have caused severe disease in humans and global transmission concerns.
NA,Symptoms of COVID-2019 include cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
NA,Related illnesses can range from mild to severe to fatal.
NA,Primary care providers must be alert to respiratory symptoms they encounter that are associated with pertinent travel history, be prepared to safely screen, examine and possibly test and/or report suspicions to the health department for further evaluation.
NA,Since December 2019, a disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) had infected many people and the cumulative confirmed cases have reached almost 180,000 as of 17, March 2020.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak was believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, a metropolis city of more than 11 million population in Hubei province, China.
NA,We introduced a statistical disease transmission model using case symptom onset data to estimate the transmissibility of the early-phase outbreak in China, and provided sensitivity analyses with various assumptions of disease natural history of the COVID-19.
NA,We fitted the transmission model to several publicly available sources of the outbreak data until 11, February 2020, and estimated lock down intervention efficacy of Wuhan city.
NA,The estimated <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> was between 2.7 and 4.2 from plausible distribution assumptions of the incubation period and relative infectivity over the infectious period. 95% confidence interval of <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:math> were also reported.
NA,Potential issues such as data quality concerns and comparison of different modelling approaches were discussed.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to healthcare workers.
NA,Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China.
NA,Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority.
NA,Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect healthcare workers in an acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational conditions.
NA,The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable goal that all healthcare systems need to strive for in the face of a potential pandemic.
NA,H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts, and it carried out the risk of human-to-human transmission after outbreak in 2013.
NA,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients.
NA,Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time.
NA,MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial.
NA,Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC.
NA,Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group).
NA,Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients.
NA,Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies.
NA,Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.
NA,In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China.
NA,Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,This appears to be a virus from <i>Rhinolophus</i> bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified.
NA,The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.
NA,The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces.
NA,As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702.
NA,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities.
NA,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
NA,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.
NA,WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.
NA,Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV.
NA,The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission.
NA,Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally.
NA,More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic.
NA,The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019-2020.
NA,We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness.
NA,In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present.
NA,Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe.
NA,Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results.
NA,Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.
NA,Based on the official data modeling, this paper studies the transmission process of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The error between the model and the official data curve is quite small.
NA,At the same time, it realized forward prediction and backward inference of the epidemic situation, and the relevant analysis help relevant countries to make decisions.
NA,COVID-19 has become a public health emergency due to its rapid transmission.
NA,The appearance of pneumonia is one of the major clues for the diagnosis, progress and therapeutic evaluation.
NA,More and more literatures about imaging manifestations and related research have been reported.
NA,In order to know about the progress and prospective on imaging of COVID-19, this review focus on interpreting the CT findings, stating the potential pathological basis, proposing the challenge of patients with underlying diseases, differentiating with other diseases and suggesting the future research and clinical directions, which would be helpful for the radiologists in the clinical practice and research.
NA,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019.
NA,Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage.
NA,China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production.
NA,However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.
NA,We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China.
NA,Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.
NA,Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020).
NA,The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively.
NA,During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively.
NA,In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million.
NA,Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage.
NA,Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks.
NA,These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic.
NA,To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers.
NA,The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions.
NA,Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.
NA,The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of Coronavirus (CoV) spectrum infections, and particularly COVID-19 disease due to SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy.
NA,Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for &quot;coronavirus&quot; or &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; or &quot;SARS&quot; or &quot;Middle East respiratory syndrome&quot; or &quot;MERS&quot; or &quot;COVID-19&quot; and &quot;pregnancy&quot;.
NA,The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language.
NA,Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19.
NA,We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions.
NA,The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery.
NA,The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score &lt; 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS.
NA,An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%).
NA,For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.
NA,When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3).
NA,None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission.
NA,In mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, &gt;90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome.
NA,Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population.
NA,There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission.
NA,Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon.
NA,The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.
NA,Acute respiratory distress is one of the major causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 disease.
NA,Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support.
NA,Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high.
NA,Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit.
NA,This is particularly true among the patient population over 65.
NA,Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress.
NA,We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs.
NA,TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression.
NA,We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes.
NA,We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak has brought our lives to a sudden and complete lockdown.
NA,While the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths continue to rise, people around the world are taking brave actions to mitigate transmission and save lives.
NA,The role sports play in this pandemic is unprecedented, fascinating, and reveals the immense impact sports has on every aspect of our lives.
NA,We must all do our part to keep each other safe until this outbreak subsides and sports and humanity are back to being greater than ever.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound impact on Radiology practices across the country.
NA,Policy measures adopted to slow the transmission of disease are decreasing the demand for imaging independent of COVID-19.
NA,Hospital preparations to expand crisis capacity are further diminishing the amount of appropriate medical imaging that can be safely performed.
NA,While economic recessions generally tend to result in decreased health care expenditures, radiology groups have never experienced an economic shock that is simultaneously exacerbated by the need to restrict the availability of imaging.
NA,Outpatient heavy practices will feel the biggest impact of these changes, but all imaging volumes will decrease.
NA,Anecdotal experience suggests that radiology practices should anticipate 50%-70% decreases in imaging volume that will last a minimum of 3-4 months, depending on the location of practice and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region.
NA,The CARES Act provides multiple means of direct and indirect aid to healthcare providers and small businesses.
NA,The final allocation of this funding is not yet clear, and it is likely that additional congressional action will be necessary to stabilize health care markets.
NA,Administrators and practice leaders need to be proactive with practice modifications and financial maneuvers that can position them to emerge from this pandemic in the most viable economic position.
NA,It is possible that this crisis will have lasting effects on the structure of the radiology field.
NA,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale.
NA,Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome.
NA,The high infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S spike protein.
NA,The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission.
NA,The virus uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization, aided by TMPRSS2 protease.
NA,The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction.
NA,Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients.
NA,Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells.
NA,This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyper stimulated macrophages and neutrophils.
NA,Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation, and balanced immune response.
NA,Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as the elderly and those with CV risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multi-organ failure and death.
NA,In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, particularly in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as IL-6.
NA,Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis.
NA,Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration and sudden death.
NA,Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery.
NA,Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis remain important.
NA,Specific evidence based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated.
NA,To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history.
NA,Since December 2019, the COVID-19 (1) has spread throughout the world at a staggering speed.
NA,As of March 30, 2020, the confirmed case number has reached 693,224 globally and the COVID-19 has claimed 33,106 lives(2).
NA,Current researches emphasize on understanding of transmission patterns, severity, clinical features, and risk factors for infection, but the data remain limited.
NA,Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19.
NA,Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content.
NA,Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments.
NA,Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors.
NA,It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.
NA,The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first detected as a respiratory illness in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China.
NA,Since then, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted every aspect of our lives worldwide.
NA,In a time when terms such as social distancing and flattening the curve have become a part of our vernacular, it is essential that we understand what measures can be implemented to protect our patients and healthcare workers.
NA,Undoubtedly, healthcare providers have had to rapidly alter care delivery models while simultaneously acknowledging the crucial unknowns of how these changes may affect clinical outcomes.
NA,This special feature reviews strategies on how to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 in an effort to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the disease for patients with cancer without infection, for patients with cancer with COVID-19 infection, and for the healthcare workers caring for them, while continuing to provide the best possible cancer care.
NA,[Editor's Note: This article includes the most current information available at time of publication; however, recommendations regarding public safety and practice may change rapidly in this situation.
NA,Individuals should get the most up to date information from the CDC website.].
NA,The rapid increase in clinical cases of the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, suggests high transmissibility.
NA,However, the estimates of the basic reproductive number reported in the literature vary widely.
NA,Considering this, we drew the function of contact-rate reduction required to control the transmission from both detectable and undetectable sources.
NA,Based on this, we offer a set of recommendations for symptomatic and asymptomatic populations during the current pandemic.
NA,Understanding the dynamics of transmission is essential to support government decisions and improve the community's adherence to preventive measures.
NA,Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1 700 bedside clinicians have been infected.
NA,A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
NA,As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
NA,Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
NA,When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask.
NA,(11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
NA,自首例新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊以来，已有大量人传人的病例，其中超过1 700例医护人员遭受了感染。
NA,对危重症患者进行呼吸治疗时有大量高危操作，例如气管插管、简易呼吸器辅助通气、无创正压通气、高流量鼻导管治疗、气管镜检查、吸痰以及转运等均可引起或加重患者气道内呼出病毒的大量传播。
NA,因此，我们根据目前最佳证据以及国内现有条件制定了本防范建议，旨在降低医护人员感染风险的同时为患者提供最佳治疗。.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, close unprotected contact, and intense aerosols-generating procedures.
NA,Sleep study and non-invasive positive airway pressure (NIPAP) therapy can increase the risk of exposure and transmission of new coronaviruses to medical staff and patients.
NA,China's national epidemic control has entered a critical stage of overall prevention and control together with the restoration of normal medical care delivery.
NA,Based on the characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing, this consensus elaborates on the recommendations from the following four aspects that include patient and medical staff education, optimization of diagnostic and treatment protocols, sterilization of medical devices and the environment, and control of hospital-acquired infection.
NA,It is emphasized that the indications for sleep study and NIPAP should be strictly defined according to the local epidemic situation.
NA,Portable home sleep study and auto-titration positive airway pressure is recommended.
NA,The applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer for sleep study and disposable or personal masks and ventilator tubing for NIPAP are strongly suggested.
NA,Moreover, it is necessary to standardize the procedure of NIPAP, to separate the functional divisions in sleep lab, to comply with the protection regulations for medical personnel, and to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection management.
NA,新型冠状病毒肺炎主要通过呼吸道飞沫、密切接触及高浓度气溶胶传播。
NA,睡眠监测及无创正压通气治疗可增加医务人员和患者发生新型冠状病毒暴露及传播的风险。
NA,在当前疫情防控及恢复正常医疗工作并重的关键阶段，本共识根据睡眠呼吸疾病诊疗的特点，从医患教育管理、诊疗流程优化、诊疗环境设备消毒管理、医院内感染的防控管理等四个方面制定推荐意见。
NA,主要强调在当前疫情流行期间，需根据本地区疫情流行情况，严格睡眠监测及无创正压通气治疗的适应证，推荐采取家庭便携睡眠监测和自动压力滴定治疗，睡眠监测尽量采用一次性气流压力传感器，无创正压通气治疗推荐采用一次性或个人专用的口鼻面罩和呼吸机管路，规范无创正压通气操作，严格医务人员分级防护和睡眠诊疗区功能分区，加强仪器设备及环境清洁消毒。.
NA,We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and modeled COVID-19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs.
NA,We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset.
NA,We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 25-69%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home.
NA,Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.
NA,Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication.
NA,Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale.
NA,Governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread in mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al.
NA,2020 [1], Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn.
NA,The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan.
NA,Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact.
NA,The scale of the problem is massive.
NA,Here I consider new approaches to improve patient's biological resistance to COVID-19 using stem cells, and how benefit might be scaled and simplified using synthetic stem cells to meet logistical needs within a short time frame.
NA,Epidemics and pandemics from zoonotic respiratory viruses, such as the 2019 novel coronavirus, can lead to significant global intensive care burden as patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,A subset of these patients developed refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
NA,This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic.
NA,We also summarise the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics.
NA,A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar.
NA,References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications.
NA,Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit.
NA,There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimised while receiving ECMO so as to minimise ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure.
NA,Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses.
NA,Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging.
NA,We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation.
NA,The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow.
NA,This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.
NA,In the global pandemic COVID-19, it is important for everyone including nuclear medicine personnel to know how to stop transmission and contain and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
NA,Here, we summarize our American College of Nuclear Medicine members' experiences from Wuhan, China; Singapore; and the USA, so to provide advice to the nuclear medicine personnel for their clinical practice and management strategies in responding to COVID-19.
NA,Effective community mitigation through voluntary behavior change is currently the best way to reduce mortality caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed.
NA,A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020.
NA,Videos in the January and March samples were viewed &gt;125 million times and &gt;355 million times, respectively.
NA,Fewer than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed.
NA,There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample.
NA,This study demonstrates the incredible reach of YouTube and the potential value of partnership with the entertainment industry for communicating and mobilizing the public about community mitigation to reduce mortality from the COVID-19 viral pandemic.
NA,With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic disease has come true.
NA,Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019.
NA,As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded.
NA,Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
NA,Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus.
NA,Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%).
NA,Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection.
NA,At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
NA,Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
NA,Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
NA,Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
NA,Head and neck examinations are commonly performed by all physicians.
NA,In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has a high viral load in the upper airways, these examinations and procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract must be approached with caution.
NA,Based on experience and evidence from SARS-CoV-1 and early experience with SARS-CoV-2, we provide our perspective and guidance on mitigating transmission risk during head and neck examination, upper airway endoscopy, and head and neck mucosal surgery including tracheostomy.
NA,Italy and the rest of the world are experiencing an outbreak of a novel beta-coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,In this context, in Italy, we reorganized the National Health System and prioritized the clinical cancer care scenario, balancing risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission versus the magnitude of clinical benefit deriving from a specific therapeutic approach.
NA,As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center.
NA,Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment.
NA,We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub-and-spoke design.
NA,Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer.
NA,Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.
NA,Treatment strategies were discussed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board.
NA,Treatment decision making balanced risk and benefits of treatment in the context of the specific pandemic level, on a case-by-case basis.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary demand on the United States health care system.
NA,Many institutions have canceled elective and non-urgent procedures to conserve resources and limit exposure.
NA,While operational definitions of elective and urgent categories exist, there is a degree of surgeon judgment in designation.
NA,In the present commentary, we provide a framework for prioritizing head and neck surgery during the pandemic.
NA,Unique considerations for the head and neck patient are examined including risk to the oncology patient, outcomes following delay in head and neck cancer therapy, and risk of transmission during otolaryngologic surgery.
NA,Our case prioritization criteria consist of four categories: urgent-proceed with surgery, less urgent-consider postpone &gt; 30 days, less urgent-consider postpone 30 to 90 days, and case-by-case basis.
NA,Finally, we discuss our preoperative clinical pathway for transmission mitigation including defining low-risk and high-risk surgery for transmission and role of preoperative COVID-19 testing.
NA,The three known human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are composed of non-structural proteins, structural proteins and accessory proteins.
NA,Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response.
NA,Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates.
NA,Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes.
NA,This review discusses the mechanisms of proliferation and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses based on the results of existing research, providing basis for future study on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of human highly pathogenic coronaviruses.
NA,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> <i>Most secondary transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in a hospital setting.
NA,To decrease person-to-person contact, health care providers have built many isolation wards.
NA,However, out-of-hospital professionals cannot access patient information, which has greatly reduced the efficiency of treatment; it is inconvenient for health care professionals to issue a case discussion with professionals from other wards.
NA,This article mainly introduces a mobile telehealth system (MTS) applied to facilitate patient information presentation and case discussion.</i> <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> <i>The MTS searches patient information, which is stored in hospital intranet, and uses five modules to display patient information.
NA,By a request/response module and a real-time interaction module, we successfully conducted case discussions.
NA,In addition, we took measures in three areas to prevent patient information leakage.</i> <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> <i>The system uses mobile collaboration technology to present patient information and support case discussion.
NA,MTS was officially launched for 37 days, during which it has been used 3,061 times.</i> <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> <i>The building of the MTS not only provides convenience and benefit for health care professionals, but also reduces person-to-person contact.</i>
NA,During the early phase of the coronavirus disease epidemic in Hong Kong, 1,715 survey respondents reported high levels of perceived risk, mild anxiety, and adoption of personal-hygiene, travel-avoidance, and social-distancing measures.
NA,Widely adopted individual precautionary measures, coupled with early government actions, might slow transmission early in the outbreak.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world since it was first recognized in late 2019.
NA,Most early reports of person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission have been among household contacts, where the secondary attack rate has been estimated to exceed 10% (1), in health care facilities (2), and in congregate settings (3).
NA,However, widespread community transmission, as is currently being observed in the United States, requires more expansive transmission events between nonhousehold contacts.
NA,In February and March 2020, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) investigated a large, multifamily cluster of COVID-19.
NA,Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts were interviewed to better understand nonhousehold, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This report describes the cluster of 16 cases of confirmed or probable COVID-19, including three deaths, likely resulting from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at two family gatherings (a funeral and a birthday party).
NA,These data support current CDC social distancing recommendations intended to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,U.S residents should follow stay-at-home orders when required by state or local authorities.
NA,On February 26, 2020, the first U.S. case of community-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in a patient hospitalized in Solano County, California (1).
NA,The patient was initially evaluated at hospital A on February 15; at that time, COVID-19 was not suspected, as the patient denied travel or contact with symptomatic persons.
NA,During a 4-day hospitalization, the patient was managed with standard precautions and underwent multiple aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), including nebulizer treatments, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy.
NA,Several days after the patient's transfer to hospital B, a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive.
NA,Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States.
NA,Little is known about specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings.
NA,To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results.
NA,Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient.
NA,Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.
NA,Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.
NA,Community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in the United States in February 2020.
NA,By mid-March, all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City (NYC), and four U.S. territories had reported cases of COVID-19.
NA,This report describes the geographic distribution of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths reported by each U.S. state, each territory and freely associated state,* DC, and NYC during February 12-April 7, 2020, and estimates cumulative incidence for each jurisdiction.
NA,In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7).
NA,As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States.
NA,Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC.
NA,On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases.
NA,Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC.
NA,Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.
NA,Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.
NA,The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO.
NA,As of April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus.
NA,The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently.
NA,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission.
NA,In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs.
NA,Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta.
NA,Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney.
NA,And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3.
NA,In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs.
NA,And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.
NA,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection spreads globally, the demand for chest imaging will inevitably rise with an accompanying increase in risk of disease transmission to frontline radiology staff.
NA,Radiology departments should implement strict infection control measures and robust operational plans to minimize disease transmission and mitigate potential impact of possible staff infection.
NA,In this article, the authors share several operational guidelines and strategies implemented in our practice to reduce spread of COVID-19 and maintain clinical and educational needs of a teaching hospital.
NA,In the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects the whole world, healthcare professionals (HCP) are at high risk of transmission due to their direct contact with patients with COVID-19.
NA,Therefore, how to ensure the triage of the patient with acute respiratory symptoms should be determined in advance, the contact distance should be arranged to be at least 2 m, COVID-19 suspect or diagnosed patient should be instructed to wear a surgical mask.
NA,During the care of these patients, HCP should wear their personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with the procedure and should not neglect hand hygiene.
NA,The samples of the patient with known or suspected COVID-19, patient should also be known to be risky in terms of contamination, and a risk assessment should be performed for the procedures to be performed in laboratories.
NA,The PPE should be used in accordance with the procedure to be performed.
NA,The protection of the HCP, who sacrifice at the risk of life, is possible only by complying with infection control and precautions.
NA,It seems that coronaviruses take an important place in the 21th century history.
NA,Five of seven human coronavirus was isolated in this century.
NA,Unfortunately, last three of them entered our life with a fear of outbreak, pandemic or death.
NA,Last human coronavirus which emerged world from Wuhan China, SARS CoV-2 and its clinical expression, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recently taken a significant place in our daily practice.
NA,Initial reports showed that, its origin was bats.
NA,It transmitted human to human by droplet and contact routes, but some doubt about airborne, fecal or intrauterine transmission also should be removed.
NA,Its R0 value is 2.3 but it could be as high as 5.7.
NA,Its case fatality rate was 6.3, but it was different in different ages and counties, and it could be over 15%.
NA,According to early models total 10–12 weeks is required to control an outbreak in the community.
NA,While different countries show different daily case numbers, total number of case, case mortality rates or R0, it seems they show a similar epidemic curve.
NA,Every day we learn new data about the current outbreak.
NA,Since the outbreak is not over yet, every detail should be evaluated carefully and the updates should be followed closely to monitor the epidemiological properties of COVID-19.
NA,Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly, how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds.
NA,We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations.
NA,This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.
NA,We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted forecasting of hospitalization and critical care needs.
NA,2019-nCoV epidemic was firstly reported at late December of 2019 and has caused a global outbreak of COVID-19 now.
NA,Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive.
NA,Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2.
NA,Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice.
NA,So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time.
NA,Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination.
NA,This review summarizes diagnostic value of saliva for 2019-nCoV, possibly direct invasion into oral tissues, and close contact transmission of 2019-nCoV by saliva droplets, expecting to contribute to 2019-nCoV epidemic control.
NA,A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with human to human transmission and extreme human sickness has been as of late announced from the city of Wuhan in China.
NA,Our objectives were to mutation analysis between recently reported genomes at various times and locations and to characterize the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics programs.
NA,Information on the variation of viruses is of considerable medical and biological impacts on the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of infectious diseases.
NA,To understand the genomic structure and variations of the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The study analyzed 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available in GenBank, National MicrobiologyData Center (NMDC) and NGDC Genome Warehouse from December-2019 until 05 of April-2020.
NA,The genomic signature analysis demonstrates that a strong association between the time of sample collection, location of sample and accumulation of genetic diversity.
NA,We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C&gt;T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T&gt;C in ORF8 gene and 29095C&gt;T in the N gene.
NA,The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.
NA,Since a novel coronavirus was discovered from a cluster of patients with emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China, it has spread rapidly through droplet and contact transmission.
NA,Recently, the novel coronavirus pneumonia which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been raised as a worldwide problem.
NA,Radiological examinations were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,It is reported that some radiologists and radiological technologists were infected when giving examinations to the patients with COVID-19.
NA,In order to reduce the infection risk of medical staff in radiology department, we summarized the experience on prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work for radiologists and radiological technologists.
NA,KEY POINTS: • The novel coronavirus spreads rapidly through droplet and contact transmission.
NA,• Radiologists and radiological technologists were possibly infected by patients.
NA,• Prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19 are important.
NA,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and more than one million infections since December 2019.
NA,The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission.
NA,Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction.
NA,Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants.
NA,Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection.
NA,We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function.
NA,It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases.
NA,The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.
NA,Cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries.
NA,Thousands of health workers have been infected and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities and prisons.
NA,World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whilst the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended airborne precautions.
NA,The 1 - 2 m (≈3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes large droplets do not travel further than 2 m (≈6 ft).
NA,We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance travelled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), US Center for Diseases Control (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on respiratory protection for COVID-19.
NA,We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 - 2 m (≈3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation.
NA,Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m (≈6 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters (≈26 ft).
NA,Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 support aerosol transmission and one study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (≈13 ft) from the patient.
NA,Moreover, evidence suggests infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes.
NA,Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, 3 hours after aeroslisation.
NA,The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.
NA,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns.
NA,With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention.
NA,Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission.
NA,The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance.
NA,During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.
NA,For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.
NA,COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness that has rapidly transmitted throughout the world.
NA,Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered.
NA,During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers.
NA,There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa.
NA,Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection.
NA,The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission.
NA,Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization.
NA,It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission.
NA,As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.
NA,The outbreak and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused an emergency in the health system worldwide.
NA,After a first development in Wuhan, China, the virus spread in other countries, with Italy registering the second highest number of cases in Europe on the 7th of April 2020 (135,586 in total).
NA,The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries.
NA,The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets.
NA,The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion.
NA,We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners.
NA,A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice.
NA,The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described.
NA,Four articles were retrieved from the literature search.
NA,Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion.
NA,The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed.
NA,Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.
NA,COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.
NA,Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.
NA,The unprecedented outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia infection in Wuhan City caused global concern, the outflowing population from Wuhan was believed to be a main reason for the rapid and large-scale spread of the disease, so the government implemented a city closure measure to prevent its transmission considering the large amount of travelling before the Chinese New Year.
NA,Based on the daily reported new cases and the population movement data between January 1 and 31, we examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the geographical expansion of the infection in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan in different scenarios of closing dates.
NA,We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the 2019-nCoV cases.
NA,The spatial distribution of cases per unit outflow population indicated that some areas with large outflow population might have been underestimated for the infection, such as Henan and Hunan provinces.
NA,Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could have been prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible.
NA,Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger for the transmission of 2019-nCoV infection in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to control the epidemic.
NA,A pituitary adenoma patient who underwent surgery in our department was diagnosed with COVID-19 and 14 medical staff were confirmed infected later.
NA,This case has been cited several times but without accuracy or entirety, we feel obligated to report it and share our thoughts on the epidemic among medical staff and performing endonasal endoscopic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The patient developed a fever 3 d post endonasal endoscopic surgery during which cerebrospinal leak occurred, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection later.
NA,Several medical staff outside the operating room were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the ones who participated in the surgery were not.
NA,The deceptive nature of COVID-19 results from its most frequent onset symptom, fever, a cliché in neurosurgery, which makes it hard for surgeons to differentiate.
NA,The COVID-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection.
NA,Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak.
NA,Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively.
NA,However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.
NA,The outbreak of a new coronavirus, first reported in Wuhan, China, is spreading around the world.
NA,Information on the characteristics of children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited.
NA,In this retrospective study, we recruited 10 children infected with SARS-COV-2 from January 27 to March 10, 2020, in Changsha, China.
NA,We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT findings for these children.
NA,Qualitative descriptive analysis was used to describe the key results.
NA,Ten children were included.
NA,Three were male and seven were female.
NA,Three were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, and seven were from Changsha.
NA,All had a history of close contact with adults with COVID-19 before the onset of disease.
NA,Clinical manifestations included fever in four cases, respiratory symptoms in three cases, febrile convulsions in one case, vomiting in one case, abdominal pain in one case, and asymptomatic infection in two cases.
NA,All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission.
NA,Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever.
NA,In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated.
NA,In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal.
NA,All were treated with symptomatic support without complications.
NA,Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children.
NA,The results of stool swab tests should be considered for discharge and release from isolation.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a growing pandemic that is impacting daily life across the globe.
NA,Though disease is often mild, in high-risk populations, severe disease often leads to intubation, intensive care admission (ICU) admission, and in many cases death.
NA,The implications for pregnancy remain largely unknown.
NA,Early data suggest that COVID-19 may not pose increased risk in the pregnant population.
NA,Vertical transmission has not been confirmed.
NA,Because no treatment, no vaccine and no herd immunity exist, social distancing is the best mechanism available to protect patients and health care workers from infection.
NA,This review will discuss what is known about the virus as it relates to pregnancy and then consider management considerations based on these data.
NA,KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 severity in pregnancy is unclear..
NA,· Social distancing is the best protective mechanism..
NA,· No clear evidence of vertical transmission exists..
NA,· Mother/baby separation avoids transmission..
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is now a public health emergency and pandemic.
NA,Singapore, as a major international transportation hub in Asia, has been one of the worst hit countries by the disease.
NA,With the advent of local transmission, the authors share their preparation and response planning for the operating room of the National Heart Centre Singapore, the largest cardiothoracic tertiary center in Singapore.
NA,Protection of staff and patients, environmental concerns, and other logistic and equipment issues are considered.
NA,Oral and maxillofacial surgery is correlated with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority.
NA,During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed.
NA,Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days.
NA,Emergency procedures do not allow any delay.
NA,Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources.
NA,Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum.
NA,Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage.
NA,When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial.
NA,There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum.
NA,In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed.
NA,In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly.
NA,The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively.
NA,Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak has drawn heightened attention from public health scholars researching ways to limit its spread.
NA,Much of the research has been focused on minimizing transmission in hospitals and in the general community.
NA,However, a particularly vulnerable community that has received relatively little attention is elders residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs).
NA,In this article we address this relative lack of attention, arguing that enhanced traffic control bundling (eTCB) can and should be adopted and implemented as a means of protecting LTCF residents and staff.
NA,Enhanced TCB has been widely applied in hospital settings and has proven effective at limiting droplet and fomite transmissions both within hospitals and between hospitals and the general community.
NA,By effectively adapting eTCB to LTCF conditions, particularly by incorporating compartmentalization within zones plus active surveillance, COVID-19 transmission into and throughout LTCFs can be minimized, thereby saving numerous lives among an especially vulnerable population.
NA,A new coronavirus, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged from China in late 2019 and has now caused a worldwide pandemic.
NA,The impact of COVID-19 has not been described so far in a military setting.
NA,We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges.
NA,Retrospective review of COVID-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland.
NA,Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs.
NA,Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers' instructions.
NA,The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission.
NA,He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation.
NA,He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours.
NA,Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2 days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company.
NA,Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them.
NA,Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours.
NA,Serological testing revealed positive for both patients.
NA,All others showed negative IgM and IgG.
NA,Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of COVID-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers.
NA,This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission.
NA,An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.
NA,Health literacy is the process of obtaining knowledge, motivation and individual competencies to understand and access information, express opinions and make decisions with respect to health promotion and maintenance.
NA,This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life.
NA,This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency.
NA,This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view.
NA,This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control.
NA,Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence.
NA,This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents.
NA,All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.
NA,Therefore, public health literacy is needed.
NA,La alfabetización en salud es el proceso centrado en la obtención del conocimiento, la motivación y las competencias individuales para entender y acceder a información, expresar opiniones y tomar decisiones relacionadas con la promoción y el mantenimiento de la salud, lo que es aplicable en diferentes contextos, entornos y a lo largo de toda la vida.
NA,Esta perspectiva conceptual es muy necesaria ante la emergencia del virus SARS-CoV-2 que produce la enfermedad Covid-19, la cual ha producido una pandemia con efectos devastadores, no sólo desde el punto de vista de la salud, sino también, de manera muy importante, desde el económico, político y social.
NA,En este ensayo se tratan de establecer los elementos basados en la evidencia científica que orientan las políticas públicas de prevención y control, entre los que destacan: a) la inteligencia epidemiológica, la cual incluye no sólo la estrategia de vigilancia poblacional sino, ante la imposibilidad real de identificación de todos los casos positivos, la puesta en práctica de estrategias de vigilancia centinela y la vigilancia basada en eventos; b) las medidas de mitigación de la propagación de la epidemia, tales como distanciamiento social e higiene, lavado de manos, cuarentena, restricción de movimiento y utilización de cubrebocas, entre otras; c) medidas de supresión de la transmisión cuando el número de casos es muy elevado, como el endurecimiento de medidas drásticas de encierro en casa; d) fortalecimiento de la capacidad de atención médica en los sistemas de salud e incremento de la capacidad de prevención de la transmisión en los servicios de salud, incluyendo la utilidad de las pruebas diagnósticas; y e) el desarrollo de vacunas profilácticas contra Covid-19, así como la generación de agentes terapéuticos.
NA,Todas estas acciones no sólo deben implementarse rápidamente desde la perspectiva multidisciplinaria y multisectorial de la salud pública para contener, prevenir y controlar la epidemia, sino que necesitan obligatoriamente del concurso de la comunidad como responsabilidad compartida.
NA,Debido a todo esto, es necesaria la alfabetización en salud pública.
NA,The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has hit Singapore hard.
NA,As of February 25, 2020, Singapore had the 4th highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections outside of China, only trailing behind South Korea, Italy, and Japan.
NA,This has had reverberating effects on Singapore's health care system, and has, consequently, also affected medical education all the way from the undergraduate to the postgraduate level.
NA,While efforts are underway to contain disease spread and transmission, the authors believe that this is an opportune time to examine and reflect on the impact that medical crises like COVID-19 can have on medical training and education and to evaluate &quot;business continuity plans&quot; to ensure quality medical education even in the face of constant disruptions from pandemic outbreaks.
NA,Medical training is as important a mandate as patient care and service.
NA,The authors believe that even in trying times like this, rich and precious lessons can be sought and taught, which will immensely benefit medical students and residents-the health care leaders of tomorrow.
NA,In this Perspective, the authors discuss the various ways in which the COVID-19 crisis has affected medical instruction in Singapore and explore pertinent practical and creative solutions for the continuity of medical training in these trying times, drawing on their previous experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 as well as the current ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had spread rapidly since late December 2019.
NA,Personal protective equipment was essential to prevent transmission.
NA,Owing to shortage of face masks, Taiwan government began to implement quasi rationing on February 6, 2020, by allowing each resident to purchase two masks in seven days.
NA,Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration offered online data with real-time updates on face mask availability in all contracted pharmacies and selected local health centers.
NA,Based on the open data, numerous software applications quickly emerged to assist the public in finding sales locations efficiently.
NA,Up until March 15, 2020, the Public Digital Innovation Space of Taiwan government had recorded 134 software applications of face mask availability, and 24 were excluded due to defect, duplicate and unavailability.
NA,These applications were analyzed according to platform, developer type, and display mode.
NA,Of the 110 valid software applications, 67 (60.9%) applications were deployed on websites, followed by 21 (19.1%) on social networking sites, 19 (17.3%) as mobile applications, and 3 (2.7%) in other modes.
NA,Nearly two thirds (n = 70) of applications were developed by individuals, one third (n = 37) by commercial companies, only two applications by central and local governments, and one by a non-governmental organization.
NA,With respect to the display mode, 47 (42.7%) applications adopted map-view only, 41 (37.3%) table-view only, and 19 (17.3%) both modes.
NA,Of the remaining three applications, two offered voice user interfaces and one used augmented reality.
NA,Taiwan's open data strategy facilitated rapid development of software applications for information dissemination to the public during the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,The transparency of real-time data could help alleviate the panic of the public.
NA,The collaborative contributions from the grassroots in disasters were priceless treasures.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China in December 2019.
NA,The outbreak further exploded in Europe and America in mid-March 2020 to become a global health emergency.
NA,We reviewed recent published articles and on-line open messages on SARS-CoV-2-positive infants and children younger than 20 years of age.
NA,Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults.
NA,Twelve critically or mortally ill children were found in the published or news reports before April 6, 2020.
NA,Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has not been proven definitively.
NA,However, six early-onset (&lt;7 days) and 3 late-onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the literature.
NA,We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.
NA,Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread.
NA,Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19.
NA,Multi-directional investigations are crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.
NA,As health care systems struggle to maintain adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, there is confusion and anxiety among obstetricians and others about how to best protect themselves, their coworkers, and their patients.
NA,Although use of personal protective equipment is a critical strategy to protect health care personnel from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), other strategies also need to be implemented on labor and delivery units to reduce the risk of health care-associated transmission, including screening of all pregnant women who present for care (case identification), placing a mask on and rapidly isolating ill pregnant women, and minimizing the number of personnel who enter the room of an ill patient (physical distancing).
NA,Although the mechanism of transmission of COVID-19 is not known with certainty, current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets.
NA,Therefore, strict adherence to hand hygiene and consistent use of recommended personal protective equipment are cornerstones for reducing transmission.
NA,In addition, it is critical that health care professionals receive training on and practice correct donning (putting on) and doffing (removing) of personal protective equipment and avoid touching their faces as well as their facial protection to minimize self-contamination.
NA,The delivery of endoscopic care is changing rapidly in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time.
NA,Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply.
NA,Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission.
NA,We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification.
NA,This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet.
NA,In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk.
NA,To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures).
NA,This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide.
NA,It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months.
NA,Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department.
NA,A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19.
NA,Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection.
NA,The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training.
NA,Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission.
NA,The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues.
NA,Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless.
NA,In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets.
NA,In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go?
NA,The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation RESULTS: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020).
NA,These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and &quot;extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs&quot;, all of which weakens the immune system.
NA,Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are &quot;incredibly vulnerable to this virus&quot;.
NA,Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health.
NA,A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently.
NA,For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs.
NA,This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.
NA,The purpose of the present study is to explore the associations between novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts and meteorological factors in 30 provincial capital cities of China.
NA,We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020.
NA,First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression.
NA,Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases.
NA,In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts.
NA,In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects.
NA,Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0 °C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/m<sup>3</sup>, and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05 g/m<sup>3</sup>).
NA,Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study.
NA,Each 1 °C increase in AT and DTR was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, and the corresponding pooled RRs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), respectively.
NA,For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014.
NA,In addition, we found the all these associations increased with accumulated time duration up to 14 days.
NA,In conclusions, meteorological factors play an independent role in the COVID-19 transmission after controlling population migration.
NA,Local weather condition with low temperature, mild diurnal temperature range and low humidity likely favor the transmission.
NA,Coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern.
NA,Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this COVID19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission.
NA,Specifically, there is increasing efforts to prevent or reduce transmission to front-line healthcare workers (HCW).
NA,However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE).
NA,PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing.
NA,Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities.
NA,Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important.
NA,Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing.
NA,Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection.
NA,Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important.
NA,Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland.
NA,Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce mortality.
NA,There are few cases of pregnant women with novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) in the literature, most of them with a mild illness course.
NA,There is limited evidence about in utero infection and early positive neonatal testing.
NA,A 41-year-old G3P2 with a history of previous cesarean deliveries and diabetes mellitus presented with a 4-day history of malaise, low-grade fever, and progressive shortness of breath.
NA,A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 serology was negative.
NA,The patient developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset.
NA,The patient underwent a cesarean delivery, and neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact.
NA,The neonatal nasopharyngeal swab, 16 hours after delivery, was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were negative.
NA,Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset).
NA,We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy.
NA,To our knowledge, this is the earliest reported positive PCR in the neonate, raising the concern for vertical transmission.
NA,We suggest pregnant women should be considered as a high-risk group and minimize exposures for these reasons.
NA,KEY POINTS: · We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 in pregnancy requiring invasive ventilatory support..
NA,· This is a case of positive RT-PCR in first day of life, suggesting possible vertical transmission..
NA,· There were no detectable maternal antibodies for COVID-19 until after delivery..
NA,As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread across China and to more than 70 countries, an increasing number of pregnant women were affected.
NA,The vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great concern to the obstetrics, neonatologists, and public health agencies.
NA,Though some studies indicated the risk of vertical transmission is low, few cases have been reported with comprehensive serial tests from multiple specimens.
NA,In this case, a female preterm infant was born to a mother with confirmed COVID-19.
NA,She presented with mild respiratory distress and received general management and a short period of nasal continuous positive airway pressure support.
NA,During her stay at the hospital, a series of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic test from her throat and anal swab, serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and urine were negative.
NA,The nucleic acid test from the mother's amniotic fluid, vaginal secretions, cord blood, placenta, serum, anal swab, and breast milk were also negative.
NA,The most comprehensively tested case reported to date confirmed that the vertical transmission of COVID is unlikely, but still, more evidence is needed.
NA,Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment.
NA,The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice.
NA,The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; in conjunction with &quot;otorhinolaryngological manifestation&quot;, &quot;ENT&quot;, and &quot;olfaction&quot;.
NA,The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea.
NA,Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present.
NA,COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia.
NA,Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially.
NA,They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT.
NA,ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19.
NA,During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases.
NA,An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.
NA,Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed.
NA,Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
NA,Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019 and the epidemic so rapidly happened within the whole country and abroad, raising serious problems and urgent concerns, such as: how to control most effectively human-to-human transmission?
NA,When does infection rate rise to its peak?
NA,What will eventually be the number of infected patients?
NA,How to make early diagnosis?
NA,What effective antiviral drugs are available?
NA,How to use the existing drugs to achieve the best effect?
NA,Can available drugs effectively improve the survival rate of critical patients?
NA,In view of the above questions, this article now puts forwards the corresponding suggestions and considerations from the perspective of clinical infectious diseases physician.
NA,2019年12月湖北武汉市暴发2019新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情，并迅速发生在国内其他地区以及境外，形势岌岌可危。
NA,新发的COVID-19疫情严重且紧迫，给我们带来大量亟待解决的问题，例如：如何最有效地控制人群传播？
NA,感染人数在什么时间达到最高峰？
NA,最高峰是多少？
NA,如何做到早期诊断？
NA,有哪些新的有效抗病毒药物？
NA,如何使用现有药物达到最佳疗效？
NA,是否能有效提高危重患者救治生存率？
NA,针对以上疑问，现从感染科临床医师的角度提出相应的建议和思考。.
NA,The previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have led researchers to study the role of diagnostics in impediment of further spread and transmission.
NA,With the recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control.
NA,Hence, we have developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a detection limit of 10<sup>2</sup> RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR<u>.</u> Notably, the assay has exhibited a rapid detection span of 30 min combined with the colorimetric visualization.
NA,This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV).
NA,Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR.
NA,Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.
NA,In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities.
NA,The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority.
NA,Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used.
NA,The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control.
NA,This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.
NA,Current studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare.
NA,The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown.
NA,Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children.
NA,We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series.
NA,Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed.
NA,A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis.
NA,Nine case series were included.
NA,In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history.
NA,The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%).
NA,Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care.
NA,Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%.
NA,Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon.
NA,There are 26% children are asymptomatic.
NA,The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%).
NA,Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19.
NA,Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease.
NA,COVID-19 has distinct features in children.
NA,The disease severity is mild.
NA,Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing.
NA,Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China.
NA,The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide.
NA,Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan.
NA,Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients.
NA,We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province.
NA,The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years.
NA,The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket.
NA,Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission.
NA,Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom.
NA,The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days.
NA,CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively.
NA,The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%).
NA,Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment.
NA,In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan.
NA,Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people.
NA,Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.
NA,We describe two elderly patients evaluated at emergency departments for anosmia/dysgeusia in the absence of any other respiratory symptoms prior to or upon admission.
NA,In the current epidemiological context, clinical and biological work-up led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
NA,Unfortunately, one of the patients died during hospitalization, but the other recovered and was discharged.
NA,In the current epidemiological situation, anosmia and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory conditions should be carefully evaluated.Special attention should be given to patients with non-classic COVID-19 symptoms in order to reduce transmission and protect health providers.
NA,After the outbreak of the disease COVID-19, it has reached pandemic proportions within a very short time.
NA,It is mainly transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with secretions from an infected person or through inhalation of droplets containing SARS-CoV-2.
NA,It is controversial whether the virus may be transmitted via tears.
NA,Exposed ocular surface can serve as a gateway in transmission and acquiring respiratory diseases.
NA,Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job.
NA,In this narrative review we discuss current evidence around detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tears and forms of transmissions reported to date.
NA,We also provide a comprehensive approach that may be implemented in an ophthalmic care facility to protect healthcare personnel, as well as patients, from contracting the virus.
NA,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated viral infection (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) is a virulent, contagious viral pandemic that is affecting populations worldwide.
NA,As with any airborne viral respiratory infection, surgical and non-surgical patients may be affected. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Review and synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining to COVID-19 infection among adult patients. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> COVID-19 disease that requires hospitalization results in critical illness approximately 25% of the time and requires mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure.
NA,Acute kidney injury, a marked hypercoagulable state, and sometimes myocarditis can be features of COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic severe acute lung injury.
NA,Even if not among the most seriously afflicted, older patients with medical comorbidities are both predisposed to infection and risk increased morbidity and mortality, however, all persons presenting for surgical intervention should be suspected of infection (and thus transmissibility) even if asymptomatic.
NA,Although most elective surgery has been curtailed by administrative or governmental fiat, patients will still need urgent or emergency operative intervention for time-sensitive disease processes such as malignant neoplasia or for true emergencies such as perforated viscus or traumatic injury.
NA,It is possible to provide safe surgical care for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and minimize nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.
NA,As we write, U.S. cities and states with extensive community transmission of Covid-19 are in harm's way-not only because of the disease itself but also because of prior and current failures to act.
NA,During the 2009 influenza pandemic, public health agencies and hospitals developed but never adequately implemented preparedness plans.
NA,Focused on efficiency in a competitive market, health systems had few incentives to maintain stockpiles of essential medical equipment.
NA,Just-in-time economic models resulted in storage of only those supplies needed then.
NA,At the same time, global purchasing in search of lower prices reduced the number of U.S. suppliers, with hospitals dependent on foreign companies.
NA,There is still a possibility that the pandemic will be manageably bad rather than unmanageably catastrophic in this country.
NA,Immediate, powerful, and sustained federal action could make the difference.
NA,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The current global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed.
NA,However, some high-risk procedures, such as those related to head and neck malignancies, cannot always be delayed.
NA,Care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible.
NA,Preoperative testing for COVID-19, limited operating room personnel, adequate personal protective equipment, and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> This article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> With detailed planning and specific techniques, the amount of aerosolization was reduced, and the procedure was performed as safely as possible. <b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> This case provides a template for future aerosol-generating procedures during respiratory pandemics.
NA,A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong.
NA,We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.
NA,We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children.
NA,We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time.
NA,Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020.
NA,COVID-19 transmissibility measured by R<sub>t</sub> has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong.
NA,Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated R<sub>t</sub> of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26-1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70-0·74) during the closure weeks.
NA,Similarly, a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an R<sub>t</sub> of 1·10 (1·06-1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68-0·77) after school closures.
NA,Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively.
NA,Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

NA,This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the clinical outcomes reported for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases were searched using a combination of key words such as &quot;Coronavirus and/or pregnancy,&quot; &quot;COVID and/or pregnancy,&quot; &quot;COVID disease and/or pregnancy,&quot; and &quot;COVID pneumonia and/or pregnancy.&quot; There was no restriction of language to allow collection of as many cases as possible.
NA,All studies of pregnant women who received a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis using acid nucleic test, with reported data about pregnancy, and, in case of delivery, reported outcomes, were included.
NA,All the studies included have been evaluated according to the tool for evaluating the methodological quality of case reports and case series described by Murad et al.
NA,Six studies that involved 51 pregnant women were eligible for the systematic review.
NA,At the time of the report, 3 pregnancies were ongoing; of the remaining 48 pregnant women, 46 gave birth by cesarean delivery, and 2 gave birth vaginally; in this study, 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death were reported.
NA,Although vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and neonates has been generally good, the high rate of preterm delivery by cesarean delivery is a reason for concern.
NA,Cesarean delivery was typically an elective surgical intervention, and it is reasonable to question whether cesarean delivery for pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was warranted.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 associated with respiratory insufficiency in late pregnancies certainly creates a complex clinical scenario.
NA,Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to threaten global health.
NA,Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of health care facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed.
NA,As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms.
NA,This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019.
NA,It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR.
NA,It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance.
NA,If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development).
NA,Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in health care settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community.
NA,The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies, and health care professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.
NA,Healthcare workers are at risk of infection during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic.
NA,International guidance suggests direct droplet transmission is likely and airborne transmission occurs only with aerosol-generating procedures.
NA,Recommendations determining infection control measures to ensure healthcare worker safety follow these presumptions.
NA,Three mechanisms have been described for the production of smaller sized respiratory particles ('aerosols') that, if inhaled, can deposit in the distal airways.
NA,These include: laryngeal activity such as talking and coughing; high velocity gas flow; and cyclical opening and closure of terminal airways.
NA,Sneezing and coughing are effective aerosol generators, but all forms of expiration produce particles across a range of sizes.
NA,The 5-μm diameter threshold used to differentiate droplet from airborne is an over-simplification of multiple complex, poorly understood biological and physical variables.
NA,The evidence defining aerosol-generating procedures comes largely from low-quality case and cohort studies where the exact mode of transmission is unknown as aerosol production was never quantified.
NA,We propose that transmission is associated with time in proximity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, rather than the procedures per se.
NA,There is no proven relation between any aerosol-generating procedure with airborne viral content with the exception of bronchoscopy and suctioning.
NA,The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 transmission is unknown but the evidence suggestive of airborne spread is growing.
NA,We speculate that infected patients who cough, have high work of breathing, increased closing capacity and altered respiratory tract lining fluid will be significant producers of pathogenic aerosols.
NA,We suggest several aerosol-generating procedures may in fact result in less pathogen aerosolisation than a dyspnoeic and coughing patient.
NA,Healthcare workers should appraise the current evidence regarding transmission and apply this to the local infection prevalence.
NA,Measures to mitigate airborne transmission should be employed at times of risk.
NA,However, the mechanisms and risk factors for transmission are largely unconfirmed.
NA,Whilst awaiting robust evidence, a precautionary approach should be considered to assure healthcare worker safety.
NA,Given the scope and speed of virus spread, the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and dangerous.
NA,Complicated objective factors such as the long-term existence of source of infection, difficulty in completely blocking the transmission route and a large susceptible population determined that the COVID-19 pandemic might stay with us for long term.
NA,Therefore, we should be ready for a tough and long battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,The strategy should adhere to the principle of combining emergency response with regular prevention and control measures, and all efforts should be well harnessed in a coordinated way to keep the epidemic under control while securing the economic and social development.
NA,从新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）蔓延的范围和速度看，新冠肺炎疫情是复杂而凶险的。
NA,由于新冠肺炎的传染源将会长期存在、传播途径难以彻底切断以及易感人群众多等因素，决定了新冠肺炎疫情可能长时间存在。
NA,因此，预防控制工作将是长期艰巨的任务，需要坚持应急处置和常态化防控相结合的原则，统筹推进疫情防控和经济社会发展。.
NA,The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the management of head and neck cancer must be addressed.
NA,Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers.
NA,However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis.
NA,The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes.
NA,Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.
NA,To study the clinical features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
NA,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital.
NA,All 13 children had the disease onset due to family aggregation.
NA,Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting.
NA,As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type.
NA,The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children.
NA,All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6.
NA,The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children.
NA,Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result.
NA,Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children.
NA,All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge.
NA,Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
NA,Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed.
NA,Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis.
NA,Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on the United States health care system, and frontline healthcare workers are rapidly altering their professional responsibilities to help meet hospital needs.
NA,In an effort to decrease disease transmission and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), surgeons have witnessed one of the most dramatic changes in their practices with rapidly decreasing numbers of elective surgeries.
NA,How do governments in China and Western democracies differ in their technological response to control the transmission of the pandemic?
NA,Based on an analysis of academic papers, World Health Organization reports and newspapers, this research compares two opposing approaches, whereas the Chinese cities and government have adopted a techno-driven approach, Western governments have adopted a human-driven approach to control the transmission of Covid-19.
NA,The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views.
NA,It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented.
NA,This paper contributes to literature by understanding the human-technology relationship, and offers five practical observations for controlling virus transmissions during pandemics.
NA,Saliva is an exocrine secretion produced from the salivary glands and has numerous functions, such as cleansing and protection of the oral cavity, antimicrobial effects and aids in digestion.
NA,Due to the speedy development in the field of salivaomics, saliva is now well accepted as a pool of biological markers that vary from changes in biochemicals, nucleic acids and proteins to the microflora.
NA,Saliva has an immense potential as a diagnostic fluid and offers an edge over other biological fluids as its collection method does not require invasive procedure, economical and is useful for monitoring systemic health.
NA,Development of sensitive and precise salivary diagnostic tools and the formulation of defined guidelines following meticulous testing will allow salivary diagnostics to be utilised as chair side tests for various oral and systemic diseases in the near future.
NA,The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is the biggest challenge and global health crisis for the world since World War Two.
NA,Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals.
NA,Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen types for Covid-19 diagnostic testing.
NA,The collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients and poses a risk of transmission of the virus, causes discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with condition such as thrombocytopenia.
NA,Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable for sequential monitoring of viral load.
NA,Saliva specimens can be obtained easily as the patient is asked to spit into a sterile bottle.
NA,The collection of saliva is non-invasive and greatly minimizes the exposure of healthcare workers to Covid-19.
NA,Saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90% with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses.
NA,Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms.
NA,SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers.
NA,Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care.
NA,More research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing aerosol-generating procedures.
NA,Novel coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens, but the first human-to-human transmission has been reported.
NA,CoVs have the best known genome of all RNA viruses, and mutations in the genome have now been found.
NA,A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31 December 2019.
NA,This study aims to report early findings related to COVID-19 and provide methods to prevent and treat it.
NA,Recent novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan City of Hubei province in China infected nearly 70,000 individuals and killed more than 1700 people within a short span of time leading to global pandemic.
NA,The disease is now spread to 26 countries in Asia, North America, Europe and Australasia.
NA,The virus is spreading rapidly to Asia-pacific and Southeast Asian countries.
NA,The disease is posing a serious threat to human population and has devastating impact on public health and economy.
NA,So far 3 Indians are infected and India is at risk of rapid spread of the disease because of its geographical location and other favorable conditions.
NA,With a poorer global health security index compared to China (India-57 and China-51), any such situation will have worse outcome.
NA,In near future there are also possibilities of similar kind of disease outbreak caused by new strains of coronaviruses due to factors like species jump of new viruses, high population density and inadequate medical facilities.
NA,In this short review we have highlighted the risk factors and transmission dynamics of coronaviruses that may pose a serious threat to India.
NA,We have also discussed about the possible preventive measure our country should take to control any such outbreak situation.
NA,COVID-19 has spread to 6 continents.
NA,Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened.
NA,The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries.
NA,In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people.
NA,We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups.
NA,We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people).
NA,We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours.
NA,A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings.
NA,By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations.
NA,We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones.
NA,The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases).
NA,In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed.
NA,This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan.
NA,We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb.
NA,4-14).
NA,Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases.
NA,We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak.
NA,The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen.
NA,With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained.
NA,The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

NA,There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery.
NA,Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19.
NA,The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
NA,Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery.
NA,One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery.
NA,Three patients were readmitted in hospital.
NA,All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine.
NA,In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered.
NA,All patients survived.
NA,In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery.
NA,Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging.
NA,Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
NA,Coronaviruses contribute to the burden of respiratory diseases in children, frequently manifesting in upper respiratory symptoms considered to be part of the &quot;common cold.&quot; Recent epidemics of novel coronaviruses recognized in the 21st century have highlighted issues of zoonotic origins of transmissible respiratory viruses and potential transmission, disease, and mortality related to these viruses.
NA,In this review, we discuss what is known about the virology, epidemiology, and disease associated with pediatric infection with the common community-acquired human coronaviruses, including species 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, and the coronaviruses responsible for past world-wide epidemics due to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has achieved community spread among humans and become a pandemic.
NA,Transmission from humans to dogs, domestic cats, tigers, and lions has occurred.
NA,Pigs, cats, ferrets, and primates have been identified as good candidates for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The potential implications indicate the need for One Health surveillance, intervention, and management strategies to mitigate the effects on animal populations and prevent a second preparedness failure during this health emergency.
NA,<b> <i>Introduction:</i> </b> The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has made surgeons change and take on newer strategies and safe exercises.
NA,All elective cases have been put off, but oncology cases need to be done to prevent progression of the disease.
NA,There is concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation.
NA,Here we discuss how we have dealt with this in our colorectal surgery department taking into account current evidence about the danger of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery. <b> <i>Discussion:</i> </b> We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum.
NA,The patient had near total intestinal obstruction.
NA,She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection.
NA,The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation.
NA,There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission.
NA,One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. <b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke.
NA,We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure.
NA,We advise taking all precautions for operating room staff to lessen the danger of transmission.
NA,After an outbreak in Wuhan, China, a growing number of countries are now suffering from an epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.
NA,Undoubtedly, reports of the skyrocketing global spread of COVID-19 has shocked people globally, from Japan to the United States.
NA,Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that the fatality rate due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units.
NA,Because COVID-19 is completely new to the human immune system, many throughout the world are likely vulnerable to becoming sick after their initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus.
NA,While our knowledge about carriers and their virus shedding is deficient, some studies modelling the viral transmission have considered the potential contribution of the asymptomatic carriers.
NA,Protocols for managing asymptomatic cases, for example for controlling them to restrict their contact with healthy people at public places or private residences, have not been established.
NA,In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed.
NA,Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention, or being diagnosed as carriers.
NA,Thus, managing the asymptomatic subjects, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while the pandemic is looming.
NA,Asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an important topic.
NA,A recent study in China showed that transmissibility of the asymptomatic cases is comparable to that of symptomatic cases.
NA,Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data.
NA,To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified.
NA,On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a new disease caused by a novel virus characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronoavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
NA,In terms of this ongoing international scenario, we report the situation in Apulia, a region of southern Italy that, as of April 2, has not yet been overwhelmed by this health emergency.
NA,In particular, we consider the care models that have been adopted, especially those that manage the requests of cancer patients.
NA,Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in devastating consequences worldwide and infected more than 350,000 individuals and killed more than 16,000 people.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to affect humans.
NA,Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
NA,COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
NA,Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
NA,The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades.
NA,The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, is the most dangerous, which spread to 163 countries and 6 continents and caused a major public health emergency worldwide.
NA,The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human.
NA,As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%.
NA,There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important.
NA,In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures.
NA,We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.
NA,The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to &quot;reschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary&quot;.
NA,The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar &quot;social distancing&quot; measures.
NA,The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams.
NA,This document also emphasizes SCCT's commitment to the health and well-being of CCT technologists, imagers, trainees, and research community, as well as the patients served by CCT.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has taken tragic proportions and has disrupted lives globally.
NA,In the wake of governmental lockdowns, ophthalmologists need practical and actionable guidelines based on advisories from national health departments on how to conduct their duties during nationwide lockdowns and after these are lifted.
NA,In this paper, we present a preferred practice pattern (PPP) based on consensus discussions between leading ophthalmologists and health care professionals in India including representatives from major governmental and private institutions as well as the All India Ophthalmological Society leadership.
NA,In this document, the expert panel clearly defines the range of activities for Indian ophthalmologists during the ongoing lockdown phase and precautions to be taken once the lockdown is lifted.
NA,Guidelines for triage, governmental guidelines for use of personal protective equipment from ophthalmologists' point of view, precautions to be taken in the OPD and operating room as well as care of various ophthalmic equipment have been described in detail.
NA,These guidelines will be applicable to all practice settings including tertiary institutions, corporate and group practices and individual eye clinics and should help Indian ophthalmologists in performing their professional responsibilities without being foci of disease transmission.
NA,As the SARS-CoV-2 virus race around the world across the different population, there needs to be a consolidated effort to understand the divergence of demographically distributed strains.
NA,The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields.
NA,Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission.
NA,Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions.
NA,It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
NA,The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region.
NA,Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.
NA,Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.
NA,An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a pandemic disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict containment measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken everywhere to hinder the spread of the virus.
NA,The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.
NA,There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19.
NA,Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention.
NA,We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities.
NA,An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.
NA,Data concerning the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients are lacking.
NA,We report a three-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission.
NA,Eight (53%) of 15 members from three families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Of eight patients, three were asymptomatic and one was paucisymptomatic.
NA,An asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son, and a paucisymptomatic father transmitted the virus to his three-month-old daughter.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of one household.
NA,The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients were &gt;99.9% identical and were clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries.
NA,During the first week of March, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak reached more than 100 countries with over 100,000 cases.
NA,Health care authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities worldwide.
NA,A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection.
NA,This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19.
NA,A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020.
NA,A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete.
NA,A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P&lt;.05.
NA,Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%).
NA,Most participants (n=276, 61.0%) used social media to obtain information on COVID-19.
NA,A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19.
NA,Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19.
NA,As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs.
NA,Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs worldwide, and further studies are warranted.
NA,A cluster of pneumonia (COVID-19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 transmits mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic diseases are high-risk population.
NA,People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission.
NA,COVID-19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to COVID-19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int).
NA,Here, we summarized the current known knowledge regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the prevention and control COVID-19.
NA,To determine the transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Iran in 2020, we estimated the reproduction number as 4.4 (95% CI 3.9-4.9) by using a generalized growth model and 3.5 (95% CI 1.3-8.1) by using epidemic doubling time.
NA,The reproduction number decreased to 1.55 after social distancing interventions were implemented.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) originally arose as part of a major outbreak of respiratory disease centered on Hubei province, China.
NA,It is now a global pandemic and is a major public health concern.
NA,Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2).
NA,Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.
NA,Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module.
NA,Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains.
NA,We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.
NA,The coronavirus disease (covid19) pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the greatest healthcare challenge in a generation.
NA,Clinicians are modifying the way they approach day-to-day procedures.
NA,Safety and reduction of transmission risk is paramount.
NA,Surgical tracheostomies in covid19 patients are aerosol generating procedures linked with a significant risk of viral contamination.
NA,Here, we describe our local approach for these procedures, introducing the &quot;5Ts&quot; of safe tracheostomy practice: Theatre set-up, Team Briefing, Transfer of patient, Tracheostomy Procedure, Team Doffing and De-brief.
NA,We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks associated with breaking the transfer circuit to attach the patient to the theatre ventilator.
NA,We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea.
NA,We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer.
NA,We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this.
NA,We summarise the steps of our protocol in an &quot;easy to reproduce&quot; way.
NA,Finally, we emphasise the importance of communication in a constantly changing environment and challenging circumstances.
NA,Singapore was one of the earliest countries affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with more laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in early February 2020 than any other country outside China.
NA,This short report is a narrative review of our tertiary paediatric emergency department (ED) perspective and experience managing the evolving outbreak situation.
NA,Logistic considerations included the segregation of the ED into physically separate high-risk, intermediate-risk and low-risk areas, with risk-adapted use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel in each ED area.
NA,Workflow considerations included the progressive introduction of outpatient COVID-19 testing in the ED for enhanced surveillance; adapting the admissions process particularly for high-risk and intermediate-risk cases; and the management of unwell accompanying adult caregivers.
NA,Manpower considerations included the reorganisation of medical manpower into modular teams to mitigate the risk of hospital transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Future plans for a tiered isolation facility should include structural modifications for the permanent isolation facility such as anterooms for PPE donning/doffing; replication of key ED functions in the tent facility such as a separate resuscitation room and portable X-ray room; and refresher PPE training.
NA,Dynamic reassessment of ED workflow processes, in conjunction with the hospital and national public health response, may help in managing this novel disease entity.
NA,The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has been characterized as a world pandemic by WHO since March 11, 2020.
NA,Although it is likely that COVID-19 transmission is primarily via droplets and close contact, airborne transmission and fecal-oral route remains a possibility.
NA,The medical staff working in the operating room, such as anesthesiologists, surgeons and nurses, are at high risk of exposure to virus due to closely contacting patients.
NA,The perioperative management is under great challenge while performing surgeries for patients suffering COVID-19, including emergency cesarean section, which is one of the most common surgeries under such circumstances.
NA,How to prevent medical staff from cross-infection is an issue of great concern.
NA,In this article, we give a practice of anesthesia scenario design for emergency cesarean section in a supposed standard patient suffering COVID-19, aimed to optimize the work flow and implement the protective details through simulation of a real operation scenario, which may be useful for training and clinical practice of anesthesia management for patients suffering COVID-19 or other fulminating infectious diseases.
NA,In December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause first started to appear in Wuhan in China; subsequently, a new coronavirus was soon identified as the cause of the illness, now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Since then, infections have been confirmed worldwide in numerous countries, with the number of cases steadily rising.
NA,The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, in particular, to deduce from it potential risks and complications for pregnant patients.
NA,For this purpose, the available literature on cases of infection in pregnancy during the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003, the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic ongoing since 2012, as well as recent publications on cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are reviewed and reported.
NA,Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate.
NA,It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely.
NA,Breastfeeding is possible once infection has been excluded or the disease declared cured.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern.
NA,It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China.
NA,The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir.
NA,The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed.
NA,The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments.
NA,To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc.
NA,No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet.
NA,However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.
NA,In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,<b>Background</b>: The current novel coronavirus outbreak appears to have originated from a point-source exposure event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China.
NA,There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event.
NA,This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored.   <b>Methods</b>: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak.
NA,We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0).
NA,We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. <b>Results</b>: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate.
NA,Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)).
NA,A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI).
NA,There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates.
NA,There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported.
NA,We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration.
NA,Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.
NA,Twenty years ago, an enzyme homologous to the previously known angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was identified, and subsequently named ACE2.
NA,In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 has counter-regulatory functions against the classical effector peptide angiotensin II, for example in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular remodeling.
NA,However, ACE2 provides an initially unexpected interesting link between virology and cardiovascular medicine.
NA,That is, ACE2 represents the binding receptor for the cellular uptake of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
NA,Thus, ACE2 is relevant for COVID-19.
NA,In this context, it was suspected that therapy with RAS blockers might promote transmission and complications of COVID-19 by upregulation of ACE2 expression.
NA,The aim of this short review is, to describe the link between the RAS, particularly ACE2, and COVID-19.
NA,Based on our analysis and evaluation of the available findings, we justify our conclusion: important drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should continue to be prescribed according to guidelines to stable patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Against the background of the pandemic caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP e.V.), in cooperation with other associations, has designated a team of experts in order to answer the currently pressing questions about therapy strategies in dealing with COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).
NA,The position paper is based on the current knowledge that is evolving daily.
NA,Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies.This position paper is structured into the following five topics:1.
NA,Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-22.
NA,Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease3.
NA,Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4.
NA,Non-invasive ventilation in ARI5.
NA,Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations.
NA,Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase.There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria.
NA,In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase.
NA,This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output).
NA,In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles.
NA,Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles.
NA,Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation.
NA,If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff.
NA,A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected.
NA,In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise.
NA,Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly.
NA,For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times.
NA,If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO<sub>2</sub>.
NA,Vor dem Hintergrund der Pandemie durch Infektionen mit dem SARS-CoV-2 hat die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin (DGP e.V.) federführend in Kooperation mit weiteren Verbänden ein Expertenteam benannt, um die zur Zeit drängenden Fragen zu Therapiestrategien im Umgang mit COVID-19-Patienten, die an akut respiratorischer Insuffizienz (ARI) leiden, zu beantworten.
NA,Das Positionspapier basiert auf dem momentanen aktuellen Wissen, das sich täglich weiterentwickelt.
NA,Viele der publizierten und zitierten Studien bedürfen weiterer Überprüfungen, auch weil viele kein übliches Review-Verfahren durchlaufen haben Daher unterliegt auch dieses Positionspapier einer ständigen Überprüfung und wird in Zusammenarbeit in der Zusammenarbeit mit den anderen Fachgesellschaften weiterentwickelt.Dieses Positionspapier wurde in die folgenden fünf Themenfelder gegliedert:1.
NA,Pathophysiologie der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz bei Infektionen mit SARS-CoV-2 bei Patienten ohne Immunität2.
NA,Zeitlicher Verlauf und Prognose der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz im Laufe der Erkrankung3.
NA,Sauerstoff-Insufflation, High-Flow Sauerstoff, nicht-invasive Beatmung und invasive Beatmung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der infektiösen Aerosolbildung4.
NA,Nicht-Invasive Beatmung bei der ARI5.
NA,Versorgungskontinuum zur Behandlung der ARIZentrale Punkte wurden hierbei als Kernaussagen und Feststellungen herausgehoben.
NA,Bezüglich pathophysiologischer Aspekte der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz (ARI) verläuft die pulmonale Infektion mit SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 in drei Phasen: Frühe Infektion, pulmonale Manifestation und schwere hyperinflammatorische Phase.Der fortgeschrittene COVID-19-induzierte Lungenschaden weist häufig Unterschiede zu den bekannten Veränderungen entsprechend der Definition des Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) nach den Berlin-Kriterien auf.In einem pathophysiologisch plausiblen – zur Zeit aber noch nicht histopathologisch untermauerten – Modell wird in zwei Typen (L-Typ und H-Typ) unterschieden, die einer frühen und späten Phase entsprechen.
NA,Diese Unterscheidung kann für die apparative Differenzialtherapie der ARI erwogen werden.Die Einschätzung des Ausmaßes der ARI soll durch eine arterielle oder kapilläre Blutgasanalyse bei Raumluft erfolgen und die Errechnung des Sauerstoffangebotes (bemisst sich aus den Variablen der Sauerstoffsättigung, des Hb-Wertes, der Hüfnerʼschen Korrekturzahl sowie des Herzminutenvolumens) beinhalten.Durch Aerosole ist eine Übertragung von infektiösen, Viren-haltigen Partikeln prinzipiell möglich.
NA,Offene Systeme bzw.
NA,Leckage-Systeme (sog. vented Masken) können die Abgabe von respirablen Partikeln erhöhen.
NA,Prozeduren, bei denen das invasive Beatmungssystem geöffnet werden muss, sowie die endotracheale Intubation sind mit einem erhöhten Infektionsrisiko verbunden.Der Schutz des Personals durch persönliche Schutzausrüstung soll sehr hohe Priorität haben, weil die Angst vor Ansteckung kein primärer Intubationsgrund sein darf.
NA,Bei Einhaltung der Vorgaben zu Schutzausrüstung (Augenschutz, FFP2- bzw.
NA,FFP-3 Maske, Kittel) kann eine Inhalationstherapie, nasale High Flow (NHF) -Therapie, eine CPAP-Therapie oder eine NIV nach jetzigem Kenntnisstand vom Personal ohne erhöhtes Infektionsrisiko durchgeführt werden.Ein signifikanter Anteil der respiratorisch insuffizienten Patienten präsentiert sich mit einer relevanten Hypoxämie, die häufig auch durch eine hohe inspiratorische Sauerstofffraktion (FiO2) inklusive NHF nicht vollständig korrigiert werden kann.In dieser Situation können die CPAP/NIV-Therapie unter Verwendung einer Mund-Nasen-Maske oder eines Beatmungshelms als Therapieeskalation durchgeführt werden, solange die Kriterien für eine endotracheale Intubation nicht erfüllt sind.Die NIV bei akuter hypoxämischer Insuffizienz sollte auf der Intensivstation oder in einer vergleichbaren Struktur mit entsprechender personeller Expertise erfolgen.
NA,Unter CPAP/NIV kann es zu einer raschen Verschlechterung kommen.
NA,Aus diesem Grund soll ein ständiges Monitoring unter ständiger Intubationsbereitschaft gewährleistet sein.
NA,Kommt es unter CPAP/NIV zur weiteren Progression des ARI, sollte ohne zeitliche Verzögerung die Intubation und nachfolgende invasive Beatmung erfolgen, wenn keine DNI-Order vorliegt.Bei Patienten, bei denen eine invasive Beatmung unter Ausschöpfung aller leitliniengerechter Maßnahmen nicht ausreicht, um eine ausreichende Sauerstoffaufnahme und CO<sub>2</sub>-Abgabe zu gewährleisten, soll ein extrakorporales Lungenersatzverfahren erwogen werden (ECMO).
NA,Little is known about the Covid-19 transmission through ocular tissue, and more research needs to be carried out in order to confirm its ability to infect ocular tissue and its pathogenic mechanisms.
NA,Covid-19 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in novel coronavirus pneumonia patients with conjunctivitis.
NA,This case report shows a severe viral conjunctivitis in a patient diagnosed with Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess ship, characterized by both red, irritated and swollen eyes, with transparent serous secretions, conjunctival chemosis, pseudomembranes of fibrin and inflammatory cells on the tarsal conjunctiva accompanied by preauricular lymph nodes and enlarged submaxillaries.
NA,We describe the epidemiology of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in a call center in South Korea.
NA,We obtained information on demographic characteristics by using standardized epidemiologic investigation forms.
NA,We performed descriptive analyses and reported the results as frequencies and proportions for categoric variables.
NA,Of 1,143 persons who were tested for COVID-19, a total of 97 (8.5%, 95% CI 7.0%-10.3%) had confirmed cases.
NA,Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5% (95% CI 36.9%-50.4%).
NA,The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2% (95% CI 11.6%- 22.0%).
NA,Of the 97 persons with confirmed COVID-19, only 4 (1.9%) remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine, and none of their household contacts acquired secondary infections.
NA,Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings.
NA,On January 19, 2020, the state of Washington reported the first U.S. laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (1).
NA,As of April 19, a total of 720,630 COVID-19 cases and 37,202 associated deaths* had been reported to CDC from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories (2).
NA,CDC recommends, with precautions, the proper cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to help mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (3).
NA,To assess whether there might be a possible association between COVID-19 cleaning recommendations from public health agencies and the media and the number of chemical exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS), CDC and the American Association of Poison Control Centers surveillance team compared the number of exposures reported for the period January-March 2020 with the number of reports during the same 3-month period in 2018 and 2019.
NA,Fifty-five poison centers in the United States provide free, 24-hour professional advice and medical management information regarding exposures to poisons, chemicals, drugs, and medications.
NA,Call data from poison centers are uploaded in near real-time to NPDS.
NA,During January-March 2020, poison centers received 45,550 exposure calls related to cleaners (28,158) and disinfectants (17,392), representing overall increases of 20.4% and 16.4% from January-March 2019 (37,822) and January-March 2018 (39,122), respectively.
NA,Although NPDS data do not provide information showing a definite link between exposures and COVID-19 cleaning efforts, there appears to be a clear temporal association with increased use of these products.
NA,There may be a risk of COVID-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest.
NA,The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations.
NA,We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; (2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies.
NA,We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020.
NA,Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question.
NA,We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome.
NA,We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials.
NA,We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection.
NA,Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery.
NA,Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19.
NA,Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes.
NA,It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.
NA,There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies.
NA,Review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020175594.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) was spreading rapidly in South Korea at the end of February 2020 following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention.
NA,The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue.
NA,Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations.
NA,Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis.
NA,This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea.
NA,The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak.
NA,Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020.
NA,Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter.
NA,We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea.
NA,This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis.
NA,Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets.
NA,Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources.
NA,The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu).
NA,People who used the word &quot;Coronavirus&quot; communicated more frequently with each other.
NA,The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms.
NA,Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis.
NA,Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often.
NA,There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types.
NA,The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006).
NA,Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852).
NA,Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames.
NA,Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames.
NA,Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.
NA,Viral outbreaks of varying frequencies and severities have caused panic and havoc across the globe throughout history.
NA,Influenza, small pox, measles, and yellow fever reverberated for centuries, causing huge burden for economies.
NA,The twenty-first century witnessed the most pathogenic and contagious virus outbreaks of zoonotic origin including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Nipah virus.
NA,Nipah is considered one of the world's deadliest viruses with the heaviest mortality rates in some instances.
NA,It is known to cause encephalitis, with cases of acute respiratory distress turning fatal.
NA,Various factors contribute to the onset and spread of the virus.
NA,All through the infected zone, various strategies to tackle and enhance the surveillance and awareness with greater emphasis on personal hygiene has been formulated.
NA,This review discusses the recent outbreaks of Nipah virus in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India, the routes of transmission, prevention and control measures employed along with possible reasons behind the outbreaks, and the precautionary measures to be ensured by private-public undertakings to contain and ensure a lower incidence in the future.
NA,During an epidemic, almost all healthcare facilities restrict the visiting of patients to prevent disease transmission.
NA,For hospices with terminally ill patients, the trade-off between compassion and infection control becomes a difficult decision.
NA,This study aimed to survey the changes in visiting policy for all 76 hospice wards in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
NA,The altered visiting policies were assessed by the number of visitors per patient allowed at one time, the daily number of visiting slots, the number of hours open daily, and requisites for hospice ward entry.
NA,The differences in visiting policies between hospice wards and ordinary wards were also investigated.
NA,Data were collected by reviewing the official website of each hospital and were supplemented by phone calls in cases where no information was posted on the website.
NA,One quarter (n = 20) of hospice wards had different visiting policies to those of ordinary wards in the same hospital.
NA,Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely.
NA,Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%).
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all hospice wards in Taiwan changed their visiting policies, but the degree of restriction varied.
NA,Further studies could measure the impacts of visiting policy changes on patients and healthcare professionals.
NA,Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents, the oral cavity is directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations.
NA,Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission.
NA,If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.
NA,We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of βCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.
NA,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is suggested as an efficacious therapeutic strategy for restoring intestinal microbial balance, and thus for treating disease associated with alteration of gut microbiota.
NA,FMT consists of the administration of fresh or frozen fecal microorganisms from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of diseased patients.
NA,At this time, in according to healthcare authorities, FMT is mainly used to treat recurrent <i>Clostridium difficile</i>.
NA,Despite the existence of a few existing stool banks worldwide and many studies of the FMT, there is no standard method for producing material for FMT, and there are a multitude of factors that can vary between the institutions.
NA,The main constraints for the therapeutic uses of FMT are safety concerns and acceptability.
NA,Technical and logistical issues arise when establishing such a non-standardized treatment into clinical practice with safety and proper governance.
NA,In this context, our manuscript describes a process of donor safety screening for FMT compiling clinical and biological examinations, questionnaires and interviews of donors.
NA,The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration.
NA,We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT.
NA,The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis.
NA,To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.
NA,An outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia COVID-19, that was identified in December 2019, has expanded rapidly, with cases now confirmed in more than 211 countries or areas.
NA,This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19.
NA,A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro.
NA,In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020.
NA,In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells.
NA,Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19.
NA,In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection.
NA,Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment.
NA,We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic.
NA,We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy.
NA,We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.
NA,We estimate a generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions.
NA,The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020.
NA,We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities.
NA,We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact.
NA,Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%).
NA,Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020).
NA,Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.
NA,We investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism by surveying expression of viral entry-associated genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues from healthy human donors.
NA,We co-detected these transcripts in specific respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,These genes are co-expressed in nasal epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells' potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance.
NA,The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and user-friendly fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org.
NA,The transmission pathways of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain not completely clear.
NA,In this case study the test for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in pharyngeal swab and anal swab were compared.
NA,A 3-month-old girl was admitted to our hospital with COVID-19.
NA,Her parents had both been diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,The results of pharyngeal swab and anal swab of the little girl were recorded and compared during the course of the disease.
NA,The oropharyngeal specimen showed negative result for SARS-CoV-2 on the 14th day after onset of the illness.
NA,However, the anal swab was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the 28th day after the onset of the illness.
NA,The possibility of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 should be assessed.
NA,Personal hygiene during home quarantine merits considerable attention.
NA,This paper is aimed at addressing the urgent need to develop a protocol that will address the operatory and clinical aspects of dental care during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
NA,The epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, and modes of transmission of COVID-19 are presented.
NA,This protocol was established as an international collaboration of three dental universities: Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, Israel; University of Rochester Medical Center, USA; and the University of Pennsylvania, USA.
NA,This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors.
NA,The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects.
NA,This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics.
NA,Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.
NA,The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks.
NA,This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19.
NA,However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks.
NA,Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 μm range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission.
NA,We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations.
NA,Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of &lt;300 nm and &gt;300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics.
NA,Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, cotton-flannel) was &gt;80% (for particles &lt;300 nm) and &gt;90% (for particles &gt;300 nm).
NA,We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration.
NA,Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (<i>i.e.</i>, thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies.
NA,Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of &quot;fit&quot; and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently.
NA,Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.
NA,The 2019 novel-coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 181 countries with approximately 1197405 confirmed cases (by 5th April).
NA,Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which got affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies are critical for our further actions.
NA,To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases show that more than 80% of infected are mild cases of disease, around 14% of infected have severe complications, and about 5% are categorized as critical disease victims.
NA,Today's report (5th April 2020; daily updates in the prepared website) shows that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092, respectively.
NA,Calculating the total case fatality rate (CFR) of Italy (4th April 2020), about 13.3% of confirmed cases have passed away.
NA,Compared with South Korea's rate of 1.8% (seven times lower than Italy) and China's 4% (69% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high.
NA,Some effective policies that yielded significant changes in the trend of cases were the lockdown policy in China, Italy, and Spain (the effect observed after some days), the shutdown of all nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea, and reducing working hours in Iran.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities.
NA,After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents.
NA,We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing.
NA,Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded.
NA,Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later.
NA,Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic.
NA,Twenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive.
NA,Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).
NA,Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents.
NA,As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).
NA,Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.
NA,Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.
NA,More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.
NA,Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.
NA,In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China.
NA,On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
NA,Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus.
NA,As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries.
NA,It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact.
NA,This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread.
NA,The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose.
NA,Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible-or the virus may cause a serious pandemic.
NA,Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus.
NA,In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly around the world.
NA,Currently, the identification of this disease is mainly conducted by using nasopharyngeal swabs<sup>[1]</sup> , but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of COVID-19 patients indicates the possibility of transmission via fecal-oral route<sup>[2-4]</sup> .

NA,This study is to investigate the clinical characteristics of late pregnancy with asymptomatic 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection, evaluate the outcome of maternal and fetal prognosis, and identify the evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission.
NA,A 22-years-old pregnant woman with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection who was admitted to our hospital on 11 February 2020 was enrolled in this study.
NA,Clinical data including laboratory test results and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning were collected and reviewed.
NA,Diagnosis of late pregnancy with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was made.
NA,Lumbar anesthesia for cesarean section was performed and a female baby was delivered uneventfully, with the Apgar score of 9 to 10 points.
NA,Three times of COVID-19 nucleic acid test for the baby was negative after delivery.
NA,The puerpera returned to normal after the operation and two times of throat swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were all negative after antiviral therapy.
NA,We reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 pregnant woman with detailed clinical information and our result indicated that for late pregnant women with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, there might be no intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.
NA,In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China.
NA,The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection.
NA,With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.
NA,As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children, and adolescents.
NA,Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare.
NA,The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention.
NA,A clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children is of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.
NA,Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment.
NA,We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19.
NA,In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases.
NA,Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing.
NA,When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection.
NA,Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering.
NA,The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020.
NA,All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative.
NA,This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing.
NA,ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320.
NA,Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore.
NA,Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.
NA,National Research Foundation (Singapore), National Natural Science Foundation (China), and National Medical Research Council (Singapore).
NA,When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance.
NA,Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions.
NA,We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
NA,We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave.
NA,We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day.
NA,We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic.
NA,From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China.
NA,We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7·1 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·8-10·9) from version 1 to 2, 2·8 times (1·9-4·2) from version 2 to 4, and 4·2 times (2·6-7·3) from version 4 to 5.
NA,If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000-359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported.
NA,The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases.
NA,These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.
NA,Health and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong.
NA,To describe and evaluate a risk-stratified triage pathway for inpatient urology consultations during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care.
NA,Consultations to the urology service during a 3-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of 3 pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk.
NA,Standard consults were in-person consults with non COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients.
NA,Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019.
NA,Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test.
NA,A P value &lt;.05 was considered significant.
NA,Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed.
NA,By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters.
NA,COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone.
NA,No team member developed COVID-19 infection.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urology consultations can be managed in a patient and physician safety-conscious manner, by implementing a novel triage pathway.
NA,Social distancing at its various levels has been a key measure to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19.
NA,The implementation of strict measures for social distancing is challenging, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) due to its level of urbanization, its social and religious norms and its annual hosting of high visibility international religious mass gatherings.
NA,KSA started introducing decisive social distancing measures early before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom.
NA,These ranged from suspension or cancelations of religious, entertainment and sporting mass gatherings and events such as the Umrah, temporary closure of educational establishments and mosques and postponing all non-essential gatherings, to imposing a curfew.
NA,These measures were taken in spite of their socio-economic, political and religious challenges in the interest of public and global health.
NA,The effect of these actions on the epidemic curve of the Kingdom and on the global fight against COVID-19 remains to be seen.
NA,However, given the current COVID-19 situation, further bold and probably unpopular measures are likely to be introduced in the future.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic seemingly is peaking now in New York City and has triggered significant changes to the standard management of gastrointestinal diseases.
NA,Priorities such as minimizing viral transmission, preserving personal protective equipment, and freeing hospital beds have driven unconventional approaches to managing gastroenterology (GI) patients.
NA,Conversion of endoscopy units to COVID units and redeployment of GI fellows and faculty has profoundly changed the profile of most GI services.
NA,Meanwhile, consult and procedural volumes have been reduced drastically.
NA,In this review, we share our collective experiences regarding how we have changed our practice of medicine in response to the COVID surge.
NA,Although we review our management of specific consults and conditions, the overarching theme focuses primarily on noninvasive measures and maximizing medical therapies.
NA,Endoscopic procedures have been reserved for those timely interventions that are most likely to be therapeutic.
NA,The role of multidisciplinary discussion, although always important, now has become critical.
NA,The support of our faculty and trainees remains essential.
NA,Local leadership can encourage well-being by frequent team check-ins and by fostering trainee development through remote learning.
NA,Advancing a clear vision and a transparent process for how to organize and triage care in the recovery phase will allow for a smooth transition to our new normal.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic demands reassessment of head and neck oncology treatment paradigms.
NA,Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes.
NA,Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society.
NA,Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed.
NA,Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: (1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; (2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; (3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; (4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; (5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages.
NA,Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing.
NA,Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery.
NA,Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed.
NA,Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options.
NA,Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient.
NA,Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19, broadly referred to as &quot;<i>coronavirus</i>&quot;) a global pandemic, while thousands of infections and deaths are reported daily.
NA,The current article explores the food systems in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
NA,It provides insights about the properties of bioactive ingredients of foods and herbs for the support of the human immune system against infections before discussing the possibility of COVID-19 transmission through the food chain.
NA,It also highlights the global food security issues arising from the fact that one-third of the world's population is on lockdown.
NA,Finally, it underlines the importance of sustainability in the food chain in order to avoid or reduce the frequency of relevant food and health crises in the future.
NA,Since COVID-19 transmission started in late January, mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of shaping the decisions around different non-pharmaceutical interventions to confine its' spread in the UK and worldwide.
NA,This Editorial discusses the importance of modelling in understanding Covid-19 spread, highlights different modelling approaches and suggests that while modelling is important, no one model can give all the answers.
NA,The world and Kenya face a potential pandemic as the respiratory virus Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects world populations.
NA,Nations have been forced to intervene and issue directions under executive orders to ensure the pandemic is contained.
NA,Kenya has reported 110 confirmed COVID-19 cases (as at 2nd April, 2020), three persons have succumbed and 2 people have fully recovered.
NA,Most of the affected people had entered/returned to Kenya from different parts of the world.
NA,Most of the people who have contracted COVID 19 are between the 16-74 years of age.
NA,As a result, since February 2020, Kenya put in place several precautionary measures to mitigate the pandemic in its early stages.
NA,However, the economic status of the population of country won't be simple to control COVID 19, if government won't integrate the realistic feasible timely plans.
NA,This article highlights the preparedness, response, transmissibility of Covid-19 and proposes intuitions to manage COVID-19 in Kenya.
NA,Currently it is clear that since first confirmation to current, the transmission of the COVID-19 is exponentially increasing in Kenya.
NA,This review focuses on best practices and recommendations for hygiene and disinfection to limit exposure and transmission of infection in outpatient glaucoma clinics during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Although current studies suggested that conjunctivitis is not a common presentation of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), several studies have reported the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) in ocular secretions.
NA,Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctival swabs in humans, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV.
NA,However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs.
NA,In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles.
NA,Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission.
NA,As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis.
NA,Our public health approaches to addressing COVID-19 are heavily dependent on social and behavioral change strategies to halt transmissions.
NA,To date, biomedical forms of curative and preventative treatments for COVID-19 are at best limited.
NA,Four decades into the HIV epidemic we have learned a considerable amount of information regarding social and behavioral approaches to addressing disease transmission.
NA,Here we outline broad, scoping lessons learned from the HIV literature tailored to the nature of what we currently know about COVID-19.
NA,We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research.
NA,The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly.
NA,Healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection, and specific requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the basic healthcare system, including the availability of general practitioners (GPs).
NA,Understanding the transmission risk is particularly important for guiding evidence-based protective measures in the primary healthcare setting.
NA,Healthcare worker contacts of an initially undiagnosed COVID-19 case, who were without personal protective equipment, in particular not wearing facemasks, were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs and polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), irrespective of respiratory symptoms or fever seven days after initial contact.
NA,The details of exposure to the index case were obtained during routine contact investigation after unintentional pathogen exposure.
NA,Twenty-one healthcare workers reported contacts with the index case.
NA,Three healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms (cough) or low-grade fever within 4 days.
NA,None of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of symptom onset.
NA,All 21 healthcare workers tested SARS-CoV-2 negative 7 days after initial index case contact, including the three healthcare workers with previous symptoms.
NA,Ten of the 21 healthcare workers reported a cumulative exposure time of &amp;gt;15 minutes.
NA,Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact.
NA,The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department.
NA,We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting.
NA,These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts.
NA,The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put health care workers at risk when exposed to aerosolized viral particles during upper airway mucosal surgery.
NA,The objective of this review was to discuss topical preparations that could be utilized preoperatively to help to decrease viral load and potentially reduce the risks of viral transmission.
NA,A PubMed/MEDLINE database review of articles was performed querying topical preparations with virucidal activity against coronaviruses.
NA,Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solutions ranging from 0.23% to 7% have been found to demonstrate highly effective virucidal activity against a broad range of viruses including several coronaviruses responsible for recent epidemics including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
NA,While specific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 is lacking, PVP-I-based preparations have been successfully demonstrated to reduce viral loads of coronaviruses.
NA,They are relatively safe to use in the upper airway and may reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization during upper airway mucosal surgery.
NA,SARS-Co-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide since December 2019.
NA,A relevant rate of patients develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome that require hospitalization.
NA,Among them, a non-negligible rate (9.8%-15.2%) requires tracheal intubation for invasive ventilation.
NA,We report the case of a COVID-19 patient developing pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema secondary to post-intubation tracheal injury.
NA,The management of COVID-19 patient can be challenging due to the risk of disease transmission to caregivers and epidemic spread.
NA,We performed a bedside tracheal injury surgical repair, after failure of conservative management, with resolution of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema and improvement of patient's conditions.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused 6088 cases and 41 deaths in Republic of Korea, and 3144 cases and 107 death in Italy by 5 March 2020, respectively.
NA,We modelled the transmission process in the Republic of Korea and Italy with a stochastic model, and estimated the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> as 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5) in the Republic of Korea, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 31 January or 5 February 2020, and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6) in Italy, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 5 February or 10 February 2020, respectively.
NA,The effect of weather on COVID-19 spread is poorly understood.
NA,Recently, few studies have claimed that warm weather can possibly slowdown the global pandemic, which has already affected over 1.6 million people worldwide.
NA,Clarification of such relationships in the worst affected country, the US, can be immensely beneficial to understand the role of weather in transmission of the disease in the highly populated countries, such as India.
NA,We collected the daily data of new cases in 50 US states between Jan 1-Apr 9, 2020 and also the corresponding weather information (i.e., temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH)).
NA,Distribution modeling of new cases across AH and T, helped identify the narrow and vulnerable AH range.
NA,We validated the results for 10-day intervals against monthly observations, and also worldwide trends.
NA,The results were used to predict Indian regions which would be vulnerable to weather based spread in upcoming months of 2020.
NA,COVID-19 spread in the US is significant for states with 4 &lt; AH &lt; 6 g/m<sup>3</sup> and number of new cases &gt; 10,000, irrespective of the chosen time intervals for study parameters.
NA,These trends are consistent with worldwide observations, but do not correlate well with India so far possibly due the total cases reported per interval &lt; 10,000.
NA,The results clarify the relationship between weather parameters and COVID-19 spread.
NA,The vulnerable weather parameters will help classify the risky geographic areas in different countries.
NA,Specifically, with further reporting of new cases in India, prediction of states with high risk of weather based spread will be apparent.
NA,Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm.
NA,The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure.
NA,Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission are also speculated.
NA,Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease.
NA,In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics.
NA,Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment.
NA,In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs.
NA,Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W.
NA,G.
NA,Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms.
NA,Scientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.
NA,In late 2019, a novel infectious disease with human to human transmission (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan China, which now has turned into a global pandemic.
NA,Countries all over the world have implemented some sort of lockdown to slow down its infection and mitigate it.
NA,Lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic fronts.
NA,However, this lockdown also has some positive effect on natural environment.
NA,Recent data released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency) indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19 such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc. has reduced up to 30%.
NA,This study compiled the environmental data released by NASA and ESA before and after the coronavirus pandemic and discusses its impact on environmental quality.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is a global public health emergency.
NA,Data on the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy are limited to small case series.
NA,To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
NA,Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20, 2020, and March 24, 2020.
NA,Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples.
NA,The median gestational age on admission was 38<sup>+0</sup> (interquartile range, 36<sup>+0</sup>-39<sup>+1</sup>) weeks.
NA,The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms.
NA,Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases.
NA,Of the 116 cases, there were 8 cases (6.9%) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths.
NA,One of 8 patients who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion.
NA,Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
NA,The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1% (6/99).
NA,One case of severe neonatal asphyxia resulted in neonatal death.
NA,Furthermore, 86 of the 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results; of these, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth.
NA,There is no evidence of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.
NA,Face mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial.
NA,We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
NA,Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol.
NA,Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings.
NA,The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking.
NA,Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored.
NA,Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR.
NA,The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S.
NA,(1102.8), U.K.
NA,(831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5).
NA,The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%).
NA,We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational 'mask-off' settings compared to only 3 in workplace 'mask-on' settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit).
NA,Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19.
NA,Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has been spread throughout China before becoming a global pandemic.
NA,In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases.
NA,We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families.
NA,Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed.
NA,Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations.
NA,Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms.
NA,The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days.
NA,A prolonged period of virus shedding (&gt;30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters.
NA,While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly.
NA,We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.
NA,Considering the current pandemic of COVID-19, it is imperative to gauge the role of molecular divergence in SARS-CoV-2 with time, due to clinical and epidemiological concerns.
NA,Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism.
NA,As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation.
NA,We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome.
NA,We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.
NA,COVID-19 is spreading globally.
NA,This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work.
NA,The clinical features and outcomes of 10 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a tertiary- care teaching hospital in Hubei province, Wuhan, China from January 23 to February 23, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
NA,All the 10 observed pregnant women including 9 singletons and 1 twin were native people in Wuhan.
NA,All of them were diagnosed mild COVID-19, and none of the patients developed severe COVID-19 or died.
NA,Among the 10 patients, two patients underwent vaginal delivery, two patients underwent intrapartum cesarean section, and the remaining six patients underwent elective cesarean section.
NA,All of 10 patients showed lung abnormalities by pulmonary CT images after delivery.
NA,Their eleven newborns were recorded and no neonatal asphyxia was observed.
NA,Pulmonary CT screening on admission may be necessary to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 during the outbreak period.
NA,And COVID-19 is not an indication of cesarean section.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic, with hundreds of thousands of cases and over 165 countries affected.
NA,Primary routes of transmission of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are through respiratory droplets and close person-to-person contact.
NA,While information about other potential modes of transmission are relatively sparse, evidence supporting the possibility of a fecally mediated mode of transmission has been accumulating.
NA,Here, current knowledge on the potential for fecal transmission is briefly reviewed and the possible implications are discussed from a public health perspective.
NA,COVID-19 has become a pandemic.
NA,The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest.
NA,This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020).
NA,A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods.
NA,In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted.
NA,Their spatial distributions were visualized.
NA,AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei.
NA,Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%.
NA,Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C.
NA,However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.
NA,On 10 April 2020, Iran reported 68,192 COVID-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases.
NA,Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus.
NA,On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus.
NA,The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix.
NA,This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran.
NA,For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized.
NA,Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed.
NA,The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively.
NA,Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.
NA,Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused concerns globally.
NA,On 30 January WHO has declared it as a global health emergency.
NA,The easy spread of this virus made people to wear a mask as precautionary route, use gloves and hand sanitizer on a daily basis that resulted in generation of a massive amount of medical wastes in the environment.
NA,Millions of people have been put on lockdown in order to reduce the transmission of the virus.
NA,This epidemic has also changed the people's life style; caused extensive job losses and threatened the sustenance of millions of people, as businesses have shut down to control the spread of virus.
NA,All over the world, flights have been canceled and transport systems have been closed.
NA,Overall, the economic activities have been stopped and stock markets dropped along with the falling carbon emission.
NA,However, the lock down of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the air quality in many cities across the globe to improve and drop in water pollutions in some parts of the world.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the most crucial global health calamity of the century and the greatest challenge that the humankind faced since the 2nd World War.
NA,In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).
NA,A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease.
NA,As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses.
NA,According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world.
NA,Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19.
NA,It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population.
NA,The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy.
NA,Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing &amp; treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc.
NA,This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world.
NA,The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002.
NA,This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery.
NA,By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?
NA,CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations.
NA,This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality.
NA,Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world.
NA,Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment.
NA,Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.
NA,This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19.
NA,Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-2.
NA,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cause various symptoms such as pneumonia, fever, breathing difficult and lung infection.
NA,Till now, total 9 cases are reported in Nepal and 4 cases from this province.
NA,This case series is to describe the initial clinical features of COVID-19 among the patients admitted in isolation ward of Seti Provincial Hospital.
NA,Oropharyngeal swab was taken from all four patients and sample was transfer to national reference laboratory.
NA,Three patients were coming from infected country and one is local transmission.
NA,Age of patients was range from 20 to 40 years of age with male preponderance.
NA,The patient coming from United Arab Emirate was presented with mild symptoms and others were asymptomatic.
NA,More tests, contact tracing and keeping them in quarantine are the necessitated action need to be taken by government of Nepal.
NA,Keywords: COVID-19; local transmission; oropharyngeal swab.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in tears and conjunctival samples from infected individuals.
NA,Conjunctivitis is also reported in a small number of cases.
NA,We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in a group of patients with COVID-19.
NA,Fifty-six patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited as subjects.
NA,Relevant medical histories were obtained from the electronic medical record system.
NA,Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects.
NA,The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire (SEEQ) were used to assess the anterior ocular surface condition before and after the onset of disease.
NA,Patients classified as severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have hypertension compared to mild cases (p = 0.035).
NA,Of the 56 subjects, thirteen patients (23%) were infected in Wuhan, 32 patients (57%) were community-infected, 10 patients (18%) were unknown origin, 1 (2%) was a physician likely infected by a confirmed patient.
NA,Three patients wore face mask with precaution when contacting the confirmed patients.
NA,Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset.
NA,The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID-19 were all significant (p &lt; 0.05 for both).
NA,Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID-19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms.
NA,Our data provided the anecdotal evidences of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via ocular surface.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic is now a global threat on human health reaching up to 2 million infected people all around the World.
NA,Since its first recognition in Wuhan, many topics were discussed intensively about COVID-19, both in the public and scientific community.
NA,Personal protective equipments and especially masks were among the hottest topics during this pandemic.
NA,Regardless of which mask is used, performing hand hygiene frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water if hands are dirty; is the most effective preventive measure for COVID-19.
NA,The type of mask used when caring for COVID-19 patients will vary according to the setting, type of personnel/person, and activity.
NA,Although the main transmission route for COVID-19 is droplets, during aerosol generating procedures airborne transmission may occur.
NA,Keeping the distancing and medical masks and eye protection during close contact efficiently protects against respiratory diseases transmitted via droplets.
NA,Airborne precautions include goggles and respiratory protection with the use of an N95 or an equivalent mask respirator to prevent airborne transmission.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a global impact on all aspects of health care, including surgical procedures.
NA,For urologists, it has affected and will continue to influence how we approach the care of patients preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.
NA,A risk-benefit assessment of each patient undergoing surgery should be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the urgency of the surgery and the risk of viral illness and transmission.
NA,Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality.
NA,Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19.
NA,Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect health care workers and ensure an adequate workforce.
NA,For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available.
NA,The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus.
NA,Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures for COVID-19 positive patients or when COVID status is unknown.
NA,Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization.
NA,Ultra-low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission.
NA,Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures.
NA,COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection.
NA,Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced.
NA,Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has spread to more than 200 other countries around the world.
NA,COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease with continuous human-to-human transmission.
NA,The origin of the virus is unknown.
NA,Airway manipulations and intubations, which are common during anesthesia procedures may increasingly expose anesthesia providers and intensive care unit team members to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Through a comprehensive review of existing studies on COVID-19, this article presents the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, reviews current medical management, and suggests ways to improve the safety of anesthetic procedures.
NA,Owing to the highly contagious nature of the virus and the lack of therapeutic drugs or vaccines, precautions should be taken to prevent medical staff from COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines.
NA,With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability.
NA,Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time.
NA,The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals.
NA,This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
NA,PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords &quot;COVID 19,&quot; &quot;SARS-CoV-2,&quot; and &quot;treatment.&quot; All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines.
NA,There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies.
NA,Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence.
NA,Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited.
NA,Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
NA,Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use.
NA,ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever.
NA,There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development.
NA,Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
NA,Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.
NA,A novel coronavirus, officially termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019.
NA,Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease.
NA,The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.
NA,Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care.
NA,Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,In late December 2019, the world woke to a reality of a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), elicited by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to a group of β-coronavirus.
NA,The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).
NA,In the last two decades, this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, following SARS which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) from 2012 till date.
NA,Globally and as of April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities.
NA,While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats.
NA,Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures.
NA,This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,First identified in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December of 2019, it has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020.
NA,In this study, we will provide a brief review of viral origin, identification, symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has gained global attention after it originated from China at the end of 2019, and later turned into pandemic as it affected about 118,000 in 114 countries by March 11, 2020.
NA,By March 13, 2020, it was declared a national emergency in the United States as the number of COVID-19 cases, and the death toll rose exponentially.
NA,To contain the spread of the disease, the world scientist community came together.
NA,However, the unpreparedness of the nations, even with the advanced medical sciences and resources, has failed to address the mental health aspect amongst the public, as all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Our efforts in this review are to evaluate and study similar outbreaks from the past to understand its adverse impact on mental health, implement adequate steps to tackle and provide a background to physicians and healthcare workers at the time of such outbreaks to apply psychological first aid.
NA,Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, the order Nidovirales, and the genus Coronavirus.
NA,They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.
NA,Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses.
NA,CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.
NA,A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).
NA,This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans.
NA,The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals.
NA,It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling.
NA,Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications.
NA,The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.
NA,The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
NA,It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
NA,Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
NA,Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.
NA,Global health authorities are trying to work out the current status of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and explore methods to reduce the rate of its transmission to healthy individuals.
NA,In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms.
NA,It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve.
NA,Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster.
NA,Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
NA,In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv.
NA,In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses.
NA,Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.
NA,Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare but life-threatening cancer of the eye.
NA,In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and proton eye therapy facilities must analyze several factors to ensure appropriate treatment protocols for patients and provider teams.
NA,Practice considerations to limit COVID-19 transmission in the proton ocular treatment setting for UM are necessary.
NA,The Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group (PTCOG) is the largest international community of particle/proton therapy providers.
NA,Participating experts are/were affiliated with the member institutions of the PTCOG Ocular subcommittee with long-standing high-volume proton ocular programs.
NA,The practices reviewed in this document must be taken in conjunction with local hospital procedures, multidisciplinary recommendations, and regional/national guidelines, as each community may have its unique needs, supplies, and protocols.
NA,Importantly, as the pandemic evolves, so will the strategies and recommendations.
NA,Given the unique circumstances for UM patients, along with indications of potential ophthalmologic transmission as a result of healthcare providers working in close proximity to patients and intrinsic infectious risk from eyelashes, tears and hair, practice strategies may be adapted to reduce the risk of viral transmission.
NA,Certainly, providers and health care systems will continue to examine and provide as safe and effective care as possible for patients in the current environment.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was initially detected in China in December 2019.
NA,Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed.
NA,Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of Münster (UHM).
NA,Single-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts.
NA,Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews.
NA,In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms.
NA,Threshold cycle (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.
NA,Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak.
NA,Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections.
NA,Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic.
NA,Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results.
NA,Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007).
NA,Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at the UHM.
NA,Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting.
NA,Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.
NA,The purpose of this rapid review is to provide an update on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments, our patients, and our new way of working.
NA,The gastrointestinal tract and the liver are affected by SARS-CoV-2, especially in patients with immunosuppressive therapies.
NA,Patients with liver transplantation should be followed closely.
NA,Digestive endoscopy is a high-risk procedure for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,While the pandemic lasts, we must adapt its indications and promote protective measures for patients and healthcare professionals alike.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our priorities and the way we work, although we do not know what the repercussions will be after normality is reinstated.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health crisis threatening humanity at this point in time.
NA,Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites.
NA,It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case.
NA,Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms.
NA,Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing.
NA,Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children.
NA,The case fatality rate is low in children.
NA,Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase - Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab).
NA,Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results.
NA,Management is mainly supportive care.
NA,In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered.
NA,As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation.
NA,Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present.
NA,An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel.
NA,To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised.
NA,As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, is similar to two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in causing life-threatening maternal respiratory infections and systemic complications.
NA,Because of global concern for potential intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their infants, this report analyzes the effects on pregnancy of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory RNA viruses, and examines the frequency of maternal-fetal transmission with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (HPIV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV).
NA,There have been no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission reported with COVID-19 or any other coronavirus infections.
NA,Influenza virus, despite causing approximately one billion annual infections globally, has only a few cases of confirmed or suspected intrauterine fetal infections reported.
NA,RSV is in an unusual cause of illness among pregnant women, and with the exception of one premature infant with congenital pneumonia, no other cases of maternal-fetal infection are described.
NA,Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection.
NA,In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses.
NA,This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event.
NA,Potential mechanisms of fetal protection from maternal viral infections are also discussed.
NA,Long-term care (LTC) facilities are particularly dangerous places for the spread of COVID-19 given that they house vulnerable high-risk populations.
NA,Transmission-based precautions to protect residents, employees, and families alike must account for potential risks posed by LTC workers' second jobs and unpaid care work.
NA,This observational study describes the prevalence of their (1) second jobs, and (2) unpaid care work for dependent children and/or adult relatives (double- and triple-duty caregiving) overall and by occupational group (registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], or certified nursing assistants [CNAs]).
NA,A descriptive secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study.
NA,Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States.
NA,A subset of 958 essential facility-based LTC workers involved in direct patient care.
NA,We present information on LTC workers' demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double- or triple-duty caregiving roles.
NA,Most LTC workers were CNAs, followed by LPNs and RNs.
NA,Overall, more than 70% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with this statement: &quot;When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work.&quot; One-sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and more than 60% held double- or triple-duty caregiving roles.
NA,Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among CNAs.
NA,LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double- and triple-duty caregiving roles.
NA,To slow the spread of COVID-19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in the city of Wuhan, whereupon it rapidly spread throughout China and subsequently across the world.
NA,Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic.
NA,Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed.
NA,Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening.
NA,Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation.
NA,Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus.
NA,This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.
NA,To report mode of delivery and immediate neonatal outcome in women infected with COVID-19.
NA,Retrospective study.
NA,Twelve hospitals in northern Italy.
NA,Pregnant women with COVID-19-confirmed infection who delivered.
NA,COVID 19 infection in pregnancy.
NA,SARS-CoV-2-infected women who were admitted and delivered from 1 to 20 March 2020 were eligible.
NA,Data were collected from the clinical records using a standardised questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co-morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding.
NA,Data on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome.
NA,In all, 42 women with COVID-19 delivered at the participating centres; 24 (57.1%, 95% CI 41.0-72.3) delivered vaginally.
NA,An elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in eight cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection.
NA,Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases: of these, 7/19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and 4/19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit.
NA,Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the postpartum period: their newborns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection.
NA,In one case, a newborn had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery.
NA,Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.
NA,This study suggests that vaginal delivery may be associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.
NA,The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has spread rapidly on a global scale.
NA,Although it is clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through human respiratory droplets and direct contact, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood<sup>1-3</sup>.
NA,Here we investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 in February and March 2020.
NA,The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients.
NA,Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding; this increase was possibly due to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the crowd.
NA,We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures.
NA,Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols.
NA,Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols.
NA,Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To study the pathological changes of the spleen in patients with COVID-19 and to analyze the relationship between the weakened immune system and splenic lesions. <b>Methods:</b> Minimally invasive autopsies from the spleen were carried out on 10 patients who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan.
NA,Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes.

NA,In addition, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization, and coronavirus particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 2 cases. <b>Results:</b> There were 7 males and 3 females, with an average age of 68.3 years.
NA,Of the 10 cases, 4 had cancer history and another 4 had other underlying diseases respectively.
NA,Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms.
NA,The time from onset to death was 15-45 days. 10 cases patients had normal or slight increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count in the early stage of the disease, 6 cases had significant increase before death.
NA,Five patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died.
NA,Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone ≤40 mg/d, not more than 5 days).
NA,Histopathological examination showed that the cell composition of the spleen decreased, white pulp atrophied at different levels, meanwhile lymphoid follicles decreased or absent; in addition, the ratio of red pulp to white pulp increased with varying degrees.
NA,In 7 cases, more neutrophil infiltration was found, and in 5 cases, scattered plasma cell infiltration was found.
NA,Macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytic phenomena in a few cells were found in a case.
NA,Meanwhile, necrosis and lymphocytic apoptosis were detected in 2 cases, small artery thrombosis and spleen infarction in 1 case, and fungal infection in 1 case.
NA,The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the T and B lymphocyte components of the spleen in all cases decreased in varying degrees.
NA,CD20(+)B cells were found to accumulate in the lymphoid sheath around the splenic artery in 8 cases.
NA,However, CD20 and CD21 immunostaining in 2 cases showed that the number of white pulp was almost normal, and splenic nodules were atrophic.
NA,CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were decreased.
NA,In 9 cases,CD68+ macrophages were no significant changes in the distribution and quantity.
NA,While more CD68+ cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to fungal infection).
NA,Few CD56(+) cells were found.
NA,EBV was negative by in situ hybridization.
NA,RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCov virus.
NA,One of 10 cases was positive, 39 years old, who was the youngest patient in this group, and the other 9 cases were negative.
NA,Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of macrophage under electron microscope in 2 cases. <b>Conclusion:</b> The death of COVID-19 occursmainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases.
NA,Spleen maybe one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19.
NA,T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly.
NA,And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues. <b>目的：</b> 研究新型冠状病毒感染疾病（COVID-19）患者的脾脏病理改变，探讨患者免疫系统功能低下与脾脏病变之间的关系。

NA,<b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the strategies on COVID-19 outbreak control in Shenzhen, and to clarify the feasibility of these strategies in metropolitans that have high population density and strong mobility. <b>Methods:</b> The epidemic feature of COVID-19 was described by different phases and was used to observe the effectiveness of intervention.
NA,Hierarchical spot map was drawn to clarify the distribution and transmission risk of infection sources at different time points.
NA,The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered model was established to estimate case numbers without intervention and compare with the actual number of cases to determine the effect of intervention.
NA,The positive rate of the nucleic acid test was used to reflect the risk of human exposure.
NA,A survey on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and behaviors were used to estimate the abilities of personal protection and emergency response. <b>Results:</b> The epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen experienced the rising, plateau and decline stage.
NA,The case number increased rapidly at the beginning, with short duration of peak period.
NA,Although the epidemic curve showed human-to-human transmission, the &quot;trailing&quot; was not obvious.
NA,From the spot map, during the intervention period, the source of infection was widely distributed.
NA,More cases and higher transmission risk were observed in areas with higher population density.
NA,After the effective intervention measures, both infection sources and the risk of transmission decreased.
NA,After compared with the estimated case numbers without intervention, actual number proved the COVID-19 control strategies were effective.
NA,The positive rate of nucleic acid test for high risk populations decreased and no new cases reported since February 16.
NA,Shenzhen citizens had high knowledge, attitude and behavior level, and high protection ability and emergency response. <b>Conclusion:</b> Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,The first-level emergency response initiated by provincial and municipal government was effective and ensured the start of work resumption after the Spring Festival.
NA,Metropolitans like Shenzhen can also achieve the goals of strategies and measures for containment and mitigation of COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 对深圳市新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）应急响应策略和措施的效果进行评价，明确人口密度高、流动性强的超大城市新冠肺炎策略和措施的有效性。

NA,从预期发病数对比可见，实际病例数大幅减少。
NA,高危险人群新型冠状病毒核酸检测阳性率呈下降趋势，2月16日之后未能检出。
NA,市民新冠肺炎知识、态度和行为水平较高，防护能力和应急响应度较高。
NA,<b>结论：</b> 深圳市早期由部门主导的防控机制发挥了重要作用，但不足以阻断新冠肺炎流行；一级响应策略和措施效果明显，确保了春节后复工复产的启动；对超大城市，采取综合性阻断策略和措施，同样可以控制新冠肺炎的流行。.
NA,We compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and COVID-19 and found that COVID-19 was more contagious, more concealed in transmission, with greater infectious intensity and more severe clinical manifestations.
NA,If the COVID-19 epidemic is not effectively controlled, it will have a serious impact on human health, and even social development.
NA,Recognizing the characteristics of three diseases, especially COVID-19, and improving the disease awareness of COVID-19 will help better implement the guidelines of &quot;scientific prevention and treatment, precise implementation&quot; and prevent and control COVID-19.
NA,本文对严重急性呼吸系统综合征（SARS）、2009—2010年的甲型H1N1（2009年）大流行性流感（简称甲型H1N1大流感）和新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）流行病特征和临床特征进行了比较。
NA,与另外两种疾病相比，COVID-19传染性更强、传播更隐蔽、传染强度更大、临床表现更严重。
NA,如果COVID-19疫情得不到有效控制，对人类健康、乃至社会发展都将产生严重的影响。
NA,认识三种疾病尤其是COVID-19的特征，提高对COVID-19的危害性认识，对贯彻&quot;科学防治，精准施策&quot;指导方针，做好COVID-19的防控具有一定的意义。.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world.
NA,In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth.
NA,However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person.
NA,Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts.
NA,Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form.
NA,Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission.
NA,On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion.
NA,Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital.
NA,On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations.
NA,The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet).
NA,The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.
NA,The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to unprecedented demands on the modern health care system, and the highly contagious nature of the virus has led to particular concerns of infection among health care workers and transmission within health care facilities.
NA,While strong data regarding the transmissibility of the infection are not yet widely available, preliminary information suggests risk of transmission among asymptomatic individuals, including those within health care facilities.
NA,We believe that the presence of a tracheostomy or laryngectomy stoma poses a unique risk of droplet and aerosol spread particularly among patients with unsuspected infection.
NA,At our institution, guidelines for the care of open airways were developed by a multidisciplinary open airway working group, and here we review those recommendations to provide practical guidance to other institutions.
NA,Performance of tracheotomy is a potential necessary step in the patient with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
NA,Due to viral aerosolization, tracheotomy carries a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the health care team performing the procedure.
NA,We share our institution's surgical safety checklist for performing tracheotomy in patients with COVID-19, including key modifications intended to mitigate risk to the surgical team.
NA,The performance of tracheotomy is a common procedural request by critical care departments to the surgical services of general surgery, thoracic surgery and otolaryngology - head &amp; neck surgery.
NA,A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology - Head &amp; Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head &amp; neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers.
NA,As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients.
NA,Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure.
NA,The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible.
NA,Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy.
NA,The safety of healthcare professionals who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating is paramount.
NA,From December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 was reported in China.
NA,Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide.
NA,In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
NA,The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service.
NA,Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies.
NA,In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals.
NA,An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners.
NA,This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.
NA,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea.
NA,However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients.
NA,The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain.
NA,Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection.
NA,Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign.
NA,The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases.
NA,Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection.
NA,No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.
NA,Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination.
NA,Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.
NA,In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.
NA,In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
NA,Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.
NA,Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.
NA,To compile current best practices regarding tracheostomy decision making, care, and technical performance during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Articles listed in PubMed and Google sources for up-to-date information.
NA,All sources presenting objective evidence related to the topic were reviewed and distilled.
NA,Tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease should be a rare event yet one that requires significant decision making and procedural deliberation.
NA,Indications for surgery must be balanced by risk of disease transmission to health care workers.
NA,Considerations are given to personal protective equipment, viral testing, and alternatives.
NA,Otolaryngologists worldwide must be aware of these considerations to provide safe patient care without undue risk to themselves or their hospital coworkers.
NA,COVID-19 has drastically altered our lives in an unprecedented manner, shuttering industries, and leaving most of the country in isolation as we adapt to the evolving crisis.
NA,Orthopedic surgery has not been spared from these effects, with the postponement of elective procedures in an attempt to mitigate disease transmission and preserve hospital resources as the pandemic continues to expand.
NA,During these turbulent times, it is crucial to understand that while patient and care-providers safety is paramount, canceling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences, and may be irreversibly detrimental to a patient's health and quality of life in some cases.
NA,The optimal solution of how to effectively balance the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined, and could include strategies such as social distancing, screening forms and tests including temperature screening, segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and health-care providers.
NA,Of importance, these recommendations do not and should not supersede evolving United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and relevant federal, state and local public health guidelines. <b>Level of Evidence</b>: Level V.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic and the desire to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; of transmission have significantly affected the way providers care for patients.
NA,Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (FPMRS) must provide high quality of care through remote access such as telemedicine.
NA,No clear guidelines exist on the use of telemedicine in FPMRS.
NA,Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic.
NA,We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms.
NA,We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines.
NA,We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments.
NA,Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.
NA,With the COVID-19 crisis, recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) are necessary for protection in orthopaedics and traumatology.
NA,The primary purpose of this study is to review and present current evidence and recommendations for personal protective equipment and safety recommendations for orthopaedic surgeons and trauma surgeons.
NA,A systematic review of the available literature was performed using the keyword terms &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;Coronavirus&quot;, &quot;surgeon&quot;, &quot;health-care workers&quot;, &quot;protection&quot;, &quot;masks&quot;, &quot;gloves&quot;, &quot;gowns&quot;, &quot;helmets&quot;, and &quot;aerosol&quot; in several combinations.
NA,The following databases were assessed: Pubmed, Cochrane Reviews, Google Scholar.
NA,Due to the paucity of available data, it was decided to present it in a narrative manner.
NA,In addition, participating doctors were asked to provide their guidelines for PPE in their countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, UK) for consideration in the presented practice recommendations.
NA,World Health Organization guidance for respiratory aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as intubation in a COVID19 environment was clear and included the use of an FFP3 (filtering face piece level 3) mask and face protection.
NA,However, the recommendation for surgical AGPs, such as the use of high-speed power tools in the operating theatre, was not clear until the UK Public Health England (PHE) guidance of 27 March 2020.
NA,This guidance included FFP3 masks and face protection, which UK surgeons quickly adopted.
NA,The recommended PPE for orthopaedic surgeons, working in a COVID19 environment, should consist of level 4 surgical gowns, face shields or goggles, double gloves, FFP2-3 or N95-99 respirator masks.
NA,An alternative to the mask, face shield and goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure.
NA,However, there is a high cost and limited availabilty of these devices at present.
NA,Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake.
NA,During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination.
NA,Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles.
NA,Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery.
NA,In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.
NA,IV.
NA,The novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused wide dissemination across the world.
NA,Global health systems are facing the unprecedented challenges.
NA,Here we shared the experiences and lessons in emergency responses and management from our hospital, a government-assigned regional anti-Covid-19 general hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.
NA,Our periodic strategies in dealing with Covid-19 were described in detail.
NA,An administrative response including the establishment of Emergency Leadership Committee that was in full charge of management was established.
NA,Modifications of infrastructure including the Fever Clinic, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic and operation room were carried out.
NA,Special arrangements for outpatient services, hospitalization and surgeries were introduced.
NA,Medical personnel training and patient educations were performed.
NA,Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced.
NA,Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found.
NA,During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy.
NA,Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered.
NA,As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission.
NA,Experience shared herein may be useful for those facilities that are and may encounter Covid-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of severe pneumonia (COVID-19) in humans.
NA,Viral RNA was detected in multiple organs in COVID-19 patients.
NA,However, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was only isolated from respiratory specimens.
NA,Here, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from urine of a COVID-19 patient.
NA,The virus isolated could infect new susceptible cells and was recognized by its' own patient sera.
NA,Appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid transmission from urine.
NA,In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO.
NA,The outbreak was found to be caused by a coronavirus which was officially named &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot; (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it was named 'COVID-19'.
NA,The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23rd January 2020.
NA,With lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus outbreak.
NA,The government has taken swift measures to contain and break the chain of transmission.
NA,Healthcare workers face the challenge of keeping patients and staff safe from the disease.
NA,There is a higher risk of mortality of COVID-19 in cancer patients and hence unique considerations for a radiation oncology department operating in an infectious disease outbreak.
NA,This article is the recommendations and adapted workflow from the two National Cancer Centres in Singapore with the endorsement by the working committee of the Chapter of Radiation Oncology, Academy of Medicine, Singapore.
NA,It highlights the challenges that radiation oncology departments in Singapore face and the appropriate recommended responses.
NA,This includes interventions, business continuity plans and workflow in managing a COVID-19 positive patient on radiotherapy.
NA,were identified beginning with the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2002.
NA,With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses.
NA,Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona.
NA,Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA.
NA,Of the four coronavirus genera (α,β,γ,δ), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under α-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and β-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a β-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
NA,Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs.
NA,SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well.
NA,The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV.
NA,Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces.
NA,The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome.
NA,The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry.
NA,The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope.
NA,The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding.
NA,The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding.
NA,Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry.
NA,Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor.
NA,Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.
NA,The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes.
NA,Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus.
NA,Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.
NA,With the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), our knowledge of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still in its infancy.
NA,Almost every aspect of the pathogen remains largely unknown, ranging from mechanisms involved in infection transmission, interplay with the human immune system, and covert mechanisms of end-organ damage.
NA,COVID-19 has manifested itself worldwide with a syndromic appearance that is dominated by respiratory dysregulations.
NA,While clinicians are focused on correcting respiratory homeostasis, echoing the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is also invading other end-organs, which may not exhibit overt clinical features.
NA,Nervous system involvement was not initially considered to play a significant role in patients with COVID-19.
NA,However, since this viewpoint was initially published, multiple studies have been released regarding the possible neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus.
NA,The past few weeks, after the viewpoint surfaced, it was noticed that it has enabled clinicians and healthcare professionals to compute the neurovirulence associated with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by very recently reported studies.
NA,By April 2, 2020, &gt;1 million persons worldwide were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,We used a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in a mid-sized city.
NA,Interventions reduced contacts of adults &gt;60 years of age, adults 20-59 years of age, and children &lt;19 years of age for 6 weeks.
NA,Our results suggest interventions started earlier in the epidemic delay the epidemic curve and interventions started later flatten the epidemic curve.
NA,We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, 20% of new cases and most hospitalizations and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults.
NA,However, when interventions ended, the epidemic rebounded.
NA,Our models suggest that social distancing can provide crucial time to increase healthcare capacity but must occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate virus transmission.
NA,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 has spread rapidly since emerging in late 2019, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
NA,Governments around the world have had to quickly adapt and respond to curb transmission of the virus and to provide care for the many who have been infected.
NA,The strain that the outbreak imposes on health systems will undoubtedly impact the sexual and reproductive health of individuals living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, sexual and reproductive health will also be affected by societal responses to the pandemic, such as local or national lockdowns that force health services to shut down if they are not deemed essential, as well as the consequences of physical distancing, travel restrictions and economic slowdowns.
NA,As an aerosol-generating procedure, traditional pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy techniques must be adapted in order to reduce the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,To describe a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for use in the COVID-19 era and present a case series of patients for whom the technique has been used.
NA,Observational case series of pediatric patients undergoing emergency or urgent airway procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology department in Australia.
NA,Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days.
NA,Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions.
NA,The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures).
NA,The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female.
NA,Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties.
NA,No adverse events occurred.
NA,In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated.
NA,By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.
NA,The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) global pandemic has already had an unprecedented impact on populations around the world, and is anticipated to have a disproportionate burden on people with schizophrenia and related disorders.
NA,We discuss the implications of the COVID-19 global pandemic with respect to: (1) increased risk of infection and poor outcomes among people with schizophrenia, (2) anticipated adverse mental health consequences for people with schizophrenia, (3) considerations for mental health service delivery in inpatient and outpatient settings, and (4) potential impact on clinical research in schizophrenia.
NA,Recommendations emphasize rapid implementation of measures to both decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission and maintain continuity of clinical care and research to preserve safety of both people with schizophrenia and the public.
NA,With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of contracting disease.
NA,Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community.
NA,This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease.
NA,Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks.
NA,To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work.
NA,This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month.
NA,Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week.
NA,Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month.
NA,While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers.
NA,These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair).
NA,The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19.
NA,Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.
NA,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 19 April 2020: notifications = 6,606; deaths = 69.
NA,The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease.
NA,Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
NA,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked.
NA,The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
NA,The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%).
NA,The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases.
NA,High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission.
NA,Internationally, cases continue to increase.
NA,The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.
NA,Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.
NA,These recommendations for physicians who perform bronchoscopy will help to protect those patients (un)-affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic, minimize the risk of transmission, and maintain clinical care for all patients.
NA,The first case of a SARS-Cov-2 virus infection was confirmed on January 27th in Munich.
NA,For both, plastic and hand surgeons it is crucial to act responsible, minimize the transmission of the virus and aid in reasonable and adequate allocation of resources for the treatment of affected patients during this pandemia.
NA,This article aims to provide an overview over the latest developments and insights that affect plastic and hand surgeons.
NA,At the same time plastic and hand surgeons are required to participate actively in the discussion of new regulatory measures that on one hand aim to ensure a proper medical care of COVID-19 patients and on the other hand need to guarantee coverage of all other patients.
NA,Furthermore exit - strategies after the pandemia need to be discussed by our societies.
NA,Naturally, this manuscript provides insight into the current situation, which might undergo changes due to the swift progression of the pandemia.
NA,In Deutschland wurde der erste Patient mit SARS-Cov-2 Virus Infektion am 27.
NA,Januar 2020 in München bestätigt.
NA,Für uns als Plastische Chirurgen und Handchirurgen ist es von zentralerBedeutung, dass wir uns als verantwortungsbewusste Menschen und Ärzte dafür einsetzen, die Übertragung von Viren zu verringern und die Ressourcen zur Behandlung von Patienten, die an der Krankheit schwer erkrankt sind, frei geben.
NA,Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt einer Übersicht zu aktuellen Entwicklungen und Erkenntnissen für das Fachgebiet Plastische Chirurgie und für die Handchirurgie.Gleichzeitig müssen wir über unsere Fachgesellschaften aktiv Kriterien und Regularien zur Versorgung von an COVID-19 erkrankten Patienten mitgestalten, den Erhalt unserer Notfallversorgung sichern und sinnvolle Exit-Strategien erarbeiten.
NA,Naturgemäß kann dabei gerade bei der rasanten Entwicklung der Erkenntnisse in der aktuellen Pandemie nur eine Momentaufnahme gegeben werden.
NA,A pneumonia outbreak with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
NA,The causative agent of the outbreak was identified by the WHO as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), producing the disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis.
NA,Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers.
NA,The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily.
NA,Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
NA,The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases.
NA,In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread.
NA,To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus.
NA,There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation.
NA,Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers.
NA,With concerns for presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 and increasing burden of contact tracing and employee furloughs, several hospitals have supplemented pre-existing infection prevention measures with universal masking of all personnel in hospitals.
NA,Other hospitals are currently faced with the dilemma of whether or not to proceed with universal masking in a time of critical mask shortages.
NA,We summarize the rationale behind a universal masking policy in healthcare settings, important considerations before implementing such a policy and the challenges with universal masking.
NA,We also discusses proposed solutions such as universal face shields.
NA,In this perspective, we recommend universal masking of the US public during coronavirus disease 2019 due to the high contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), viral shedding of viable SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals, and the likely contribution of masking to core distancing public health strategies for curbing transmission.
NA,Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country.
NA,Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection.
NA,The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough.
NA,Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count.
NA,While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited.
NA,The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low.
NA,There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination.
NA,This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments.
NA,Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments.
NA,We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice.
NA,All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions.
NA,The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage.
NA,Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen.
NA,Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment.
NA,Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment.
NA,Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively.
NA,The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s.
NA,The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels.
NA,Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures.
NA,This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.
NA,At the beginning of a COVID-19 infection, there is a period of time known as the exposed or latency period, before an infected person is capable of transmitting the infection to another person.
NA,We develop two differential equations models to account for this period.
NA,The first is a model that incorporates infected persons in the exposed class, before transmission is possible.
NA,The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible.
NA,We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China.
NA,We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases.
NA,We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,An epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, which appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,This disease was named as &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was first identified as an etiological pathogen of COVID-19, belonging to the species of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV).
NA,The speed of both the geographical transmission and the sudden increase in numbers of cases is much faster than SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
NA,COVID-19 is the first global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, which outbreaks in 211 countries/territories/areas.
NA,The vaccine against COVID-19, regarded as an effective prophylactic strategy for control and prevention, is being developed in about 90 institutions worldwide.
NA,The experiences and lessons encountered in the previous SARS and MERS vaccine research can be used for reference in the development of COVID-19 vaccine.
NA,The present paper hopes to provide some insights for COVID-19 vaccines researchers.
NA,新型冠状病毒 (SARS-CoV-2) 是一种可引起人新型冠状病毒肺炎 (COVID-19) 的新发呼吸道病原体，与重症急性呼吸道综合症冠状病毒 (SARS-CoV) 和中东呼吸综合征冠状病毒 (MERS-CoV) 同属于β-冠状病毒，具有较高的传染性和一定的致死率。
NA,2019 年12 月在我国武汉被发现，随后蔓延到我国大部分省份，给我国人民健康和经济发展造成巨大损失。
NA,疫苗接种是预防和控制传染病的常规和有效手段，国内外多个机构已启动COVID-19 疫苗研究工作。
NA,文中基于SARS 和MERS 疫苗研究的经验和教训，对COVID-19 疫苗的研究策略和需要注意的关键问题进行了阐述，为相关研究人员提供参考。.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic during the first months of 2020 is causing profound changes in worldwide health care systems, resulting in a major reduction of surgical interventions and routine non-urgent outpatient diagnostic procedures.
NA,The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
NA,The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
NA,In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
NA,Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
NA,BackgroundCOVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China and subsequently developed into an ongoing epidemic.
NA,Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance.AimsThis study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.MethodsWe extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection.
NA,We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation.
NA,A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay.
NA,Secondary attack rate was also estimated.ResultsThe empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81).
NA,Containment delay increased significantly over time.
NA,Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay.
NA,The empirical serial interval was 4.58-6.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector-infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation.
NA,The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.
NA,ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement.
NA,Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease, first emerged in Wuhan, rapidly spread all over the world since December 2019.
NA,There are concerns about elective dermatology appointments and its results.
NA,Herein, we aimed to find out which type of dermatologic patients attended to dermatology outpatient clinic.
NA,The patients visiting the clinics for elective dermatologic diseases between March 11 and 18, 2020, were included in this study.
NA,Their age, sex, diagnosis of disease, requirement for emergent intervention, and their medical records about COVID-19 were obtained.
NA,There were 390 patients attending to the dermatology outpatient clinic in this period.
NA,The most common disease was acne (N: 94, 24%), only 19% of patients need emergent interventions or dose adjustment.
NA,There were 40 (10%) patients over the age of 65.
NA,After their visits, five patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 in 2weeks.
NA,Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission since being closed to the patient.
NA,Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital.
NA,Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of our patients were not screened for COVID-19.
NA,Our findings support the concerns of elective physician examinations.
NA,In the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) had the second highest number of cases globally yet was able to dramatically lower the incidence of new cases and sustain a low mortality rate, making it a promising example of strong national response.
NA,We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19.
NA,Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care.
NA,Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
NA,Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
NA,Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
NA,South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
NA,As an aerosol and droplets generating procedure, tracheostomy increases contamination risks for health workers in the coronavirus disease context.
NA,To preserve the health care system capacity and to limit virus cross-transmission, protecting caregivers against coronavirus infection is of critical importance.
NA,We report the use of external fixator equipment to set up a physical interface between the patient's neck and the caregiver performing a tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Once the metal frame set in place, it is wrapped with a single-use clear and sterile cover for surgical C-arm.
NA,This installation is simple, easy, and fast to achieve and can be carried out with inexpensive material available in every hospital.
NA,This physical interface is an additional safety measure that prevents the direct projection of secretions or droplets.
NA,It should, of course, only be considered as a complement to strict compliance with barrier precautions and personal protective equipment.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the hematology practice.
NA,Intensive chemotherapies for high-grade lymphomas and acute leukemias, multiple myeloma treatments and most hematopoietic stem cell transplantations should be performed as usual.
NA,Low-grade lymphomas should only be treated when strictly indicated, maintenance can be postponed.
NA,Other myeloid neoplasia and their therapies cause imunosupression; dose adjustment is recommended but no brisk stopping.
NA,Sickle cell anemia patients are highly succeptible to severe COVID-19 course.
NA,Thrombocytopenia and procoagulant state are associated with severe courses of COVID-19, requiring an individualized therapy.
NA,No data indicate a risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood product transfusion.
NA,La pandémie de COVID-19 affecte la prise en charge hématologique.
NA,Les chimiothérapies intensives pour les lymphomes agressifs et les leucémies aiguës, les traitements du myélome multiple, ainsi que la plupart des greffes de cellules souches hématopoïétiques doivent continuer à être pratiquées.
NA,Les lymphomes de bas grade seront traités uniquement avec des indications claires ; et la maintenance repoussée.
NA,Les autres néoplasies myéloïdes et leurs traitements causent une immunosuppression ; on recommande une adaptation des doses, mais pas d’arrêt brusque.
NA,La drépanocytose rend les patients très vulnérables au COVID-19.
NA,La thrombopénie signe un état procoagulant et la sévérité du COVID-19, nécessitant un traitement individualisé.
NA,Aucune donnée n’indique de risque d’une transmission du SARS-CoV-2 par transfusion de produits sanguins.
NA,Current pandemic implies changes in patient care in rheumatology to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission to patients visiting health-care facilities, by organizing less frequent blood tests, using teleconsultations, and switching from intravenous to subcutaneous drug administration.
NA,Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities.
NA,However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations.
NA,Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic.
NA,In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
NA,La pandémie a impliqué une réorganisation des soins en rhumatologie pour limiter les déplacements des patients : espacement des prises de sang, administration sous-cutanée des traitements, téléconsultations.
NA,Les patients traités par immunosuppresseurs sont reconnus comme vulnérables par les autorités et bénéficient des protections qui en découlent.
NA,Sous réserves du peu de données disponibles, il n’est pas constaté d’augmentation du risque de développer de formes graves de COVID-19 chez les patients souffrant de rhumatismes inflammatoires traités par immunosuppresseurs.
NA,Il existe ainsi un consensus pour recommander la poursuite de ces traitements pendant la pandémie.
NA,Leur arrêt n’est recommandé qu’en cas d’infection avérée à SARS-CoV-2, à l’exception de la prednisone, de l’hydroxychloroquine et de la sulfasalazine qui peuvent être poursuivis.
NA,Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are underrepresented during the current COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 rather infects adults who subsequently infect their children.
NA,From recent Chinese and Italian data, children commonly present mild to moderate disease, a large proportion of them being asymptomatic.
NA,In particular, children present significantly less fever, cough and pneumonia compared to adults.
NA,However, more cases of pneumonia were reported from children infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with H1N1.
NA,No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been described so far.
NA,Les enfants sont sous-représentés durant la pandémie COVID-19 actuelle.
NA,Contrairement aux autres virus respiratoires, dans la majorité des clusters familiaux, ce sont les parents qui infectent les enfants.
NA,Les évidences cliniques chinoises et italiennes suggèrent que les enfants présentent souvent un tableau clinique peu sévère et qu’ils sont fréquemment asymptomatiques.
NA,Notamment, les enfants présentent moins de fièvre, de toux et de pneumonies comparés aux adultes.
NA,Toutefois, plus de cas de pneumonies ont été reportés chez des enfants infectés par SARS-CoV-2 que chez ceux qui le sont par H1N1.
NA,Aucun cas de transmission verticale de SARS-CoV-2 n’a été démontré récemment.
NA,Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships.
NA,As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns.
NA,This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing.
NA,First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing.
NA,Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting.
NA,Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems.
NA,Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress.
NA,The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods.
NA,The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework.
NA,Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created.
NA,Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun.
NA,Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought.
NA,This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures.
NA,The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app.
NA,This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.
NA,This article presents the strategies and actions adopted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to hold back COVID-19.
NA,The response to the disease was immediate and occurred prior to the first case being detected in Brazil.
NA,Provision of information and communication to the population and the press was adopted as a fundamental strategy for addressing the epidemic.
NA,Guidance provided to the population has been clear, stressing the importance of coronavirus transmission prevention measures.
NA,Efforts have been directed towards strengthening health surveillance and health care, as well as boosting research, development and innovation.
NA,Actions have targeted human resource training and expanding coverage afforded by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).
NA,Protecting health workers is a priority.
NA,All SUS health workers, managers and directors are dedicated to preserving the health and life of each and every Brazilian citizen.
NA,The global COVID-19 pandemic brings new challenges to otolaryngology resident education.
NA,Surgical volume and clinic visits are curtailed, personal protective equipment for operating room participation is restricted, and the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission during heretofore routine patient care is the new norm.
NA,We describe a small-team &quot;cohorting&quot; protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures.
NA,A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between department members but providing comprehensive coverage.
NA,Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions.
NA,Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures.
NA,Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy.
NA,A small-team-based approach with guidelines for faculty/resident roles may mitigate risk while optimizing patient care and maximizing education.
NA,Otolaryngologists represent a subset of health care workers uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission.
NA,Given the segmentation of extant guidelines concerning precautions and protective equipment for SARS-CoV2, we aimed to provide consolidated recommendations regarding appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in head neck surgery during the COVID-19 era.
NA,Guidelines published by international and US governing bodies were reviewed in conjunction with published literature concerning COVID-19 transmission risk, testing, and PPE, to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers managing COVID-19 patients.
NA,High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head and neck instrumentation and appropriate PPE during head and neck surgeries are lacking.
NA,However, extrapolation of recommendations by governing bodies suggests strongly that head and neck mucosal instrumentation warrants strict adherence to airborne-level precautions.
NA,We present a series of situation-specific recommendations for PPE use and other procedural precautions for otolaryngology providers to consider in the COVID-19 era.
NA,The United States now has the highest death toll due to COVID-19.
NA,Many otolaryngology procedures, including laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy, place otolaryngologists at increased risk of coronavirus transmission due to close contact with respiratory droplets and aerosolization from the procedure.
NA,The aim of this study is to provide an overview of guidelines on how to perform these procedures during the coronavirus pandemic.
NA,Literature review was performed.
NA,Articles citing laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy use with regard to COVID-19 were included.
NA,Laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy are all used in both emergent and elective situations.
NA,Understanding the risk stratification of cases and the varied necessity of personal protective equipment is important in protecting patients and health care workers.
NA,Summary guidelines based on the literature available at this time are presented in order to decrease transmission of the virus and protect those involved.
NA,In light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) released a joint statement in March 2020 recommending an immediate suspension of medical student participation in direct patient contact.
NA,As graduating medical students who will soon begin residency, the authors fully support this recommendation.
NA,Though paid health care workers, like residents, nurses, and environmental services staff, are essential to the management of COVID-19 patients, medical students are not.
NA,Students' continued involvement in direct patient care will contribute to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmissions and will waste already limited personal protective equipment.
NA,By decreasing non-essential personnel in health care settings, including medical students, medical schools will contribute to national and global efforts to &quot;flatten the curve.&quot;The authors also assert that medical schools are responsible for ensuring medical student safety.
NA,Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles.
NA,Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; supersedes usual teaching responsibilities.
NA,Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines.
NA,The pool of graduating medical students affected by this pause in direct patient contact represents a powerful reserve, which may soon need to be utilized as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the U.S. health care infrastructure.
NA,China announced an outbreak of new coronavirus in the city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019; lash to now, the virus transmission has become pandemic worldwide.
NA,Severe cases from Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan were confirmed pneumonia with a novel coronavirus. (2019-nCoV).
NA,Understanding the molecular mechanisms of genome selection and packaging is critical for developing antiviral strategies.
NA,Thus, we defined the correlation in ten SARS-CoV2 sequences from different countries to analyze the genomic patterns of disease origin and evolution aiming for development new control pandemic processes.
NA,We apply genomic analysis to observe SARS-Co-V2 sequences from GenBank (http:// www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 China, C1), MN985325 (USA:WA, UW), MN996527 (China, C2), MT007544 (Australia:Victoria, A1), MT027064 (USA:CA, UC), MT039890 (South Korea, K1), MT066175 (Taiwan,T1), MT066176 (Taiwan, T2), LC528232 (Japan, J1), and LC528233 (Japan, J2) for genomic sequence alignment an analysis.
NA,Multiple Sequence Alignment by Clustalw (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) web is applied as our alignment tool.
NA,We analyze ten sequences from NCBI database by genome alignment and find no difference in amino acid sequences within M and N proteins.
NA,There are two amino acid variances in Spike protein region.
NA,One mutation found from south Korea sequence is verified.
NA,Two possible &quot;L&quot; and &quot;S&quot; SNP found in ORF1ab and ORF8 regions are detected CONCLUSION:: We perform genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequence of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Studies about the biological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in clinic animal and humans will manipulate an understanding the origin of pandemic crisis.
NA,Since December 2019 the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2160000 positive cases and more than 145000 deaths until 18 April 2020.
NA,The pressure to the health services worldwide has been unprecedented.The redeployment of staff and resources to treat more efficiently COVID-19 cases along with the need to reduce disease transmission has affected the field of electrophysiology among many others.Amendments to clinical pathways are obligatory in this perspective to continue to provide the necessary health services to the people who need them while at the same time infection control and prevention are not compromised by inadvertent disease transmission or unnecessary use of resources.We aim to providea guide of the logistic aspects of electrophysiology procedures derived fromour Tertiary Cardiac Centre duringthe current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2, was first reported in December 2019.
NA,The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and as of April 17, 2020, 210 countries are affected with &gt;2,000,000 infected and 140,000 deaths.
NA,The estimated case fatality rate is around 6.7%.
NA,We need to step up our infection control measures immediately or else it may be too late to contain or control the spread of COVID-19.
NA,In case of local outbreaks, the risk of infection to healthcare workers and patients is high.
NA,Ophthalmic practice carries some unique risks and therefore high vigilance and special precautions are needed.
NA,We share our protocols and experiences in the prevention of infection in the current COVID-19 outbreak and the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Hong Kong.
NA,We also endeavor to answer the key frequently asked questions in areas of the coronaviruses, COVID-19, disease transmission, personal protection, mask selection, and special measures in ophthalmic practices.
NA,COVID-19 is highly infectious and could be life-threatening.
NA,Using our protocol and measures, we have achieved zero infection in our ophthalmic practices in Hong Kong and China.
NA,Preventing spread of COVID-19 is possible and achievable.
NA,Sudden, large-scale and diffuse human migration can amplify localized outbreaks of disease into widespread epidemics<sup>1-4</sup>.
NA,Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative.
NA,Here we use 11,478,484 counts of mobile phone data from individuals leaving or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout China.
NA,First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement.
NA,Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across all of China.
NA,Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage.
NA,Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations.
NA,This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.
NA,Recently, an outbreak of viral pneumonitis in Wuhan, Hubei, China successively spread as a global pandemia, led to the identification of a novel betacoronavirus species, the 2019 novel coronavirus, successively designated 2019-nCoV then SARS-CoV-2).
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
NA,Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies.
NA,This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.
NA,Intense non-pharmaceutical interventions were put in place in China to stop transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear.
NA,To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province.
NA,Daily contacts were reduced 7-8-fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household.
NA,We find that children 0-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults 15-64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95%CI 0.24-0.49), while in contrast, individuals over 65 years are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95%CI: 1.12-1.92).
NA,Based on these data, we build a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission.
NA,We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19.
NA,While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 started in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
NA,Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world.
NA,In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu <sup>TM</sup> database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak.
NA,We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus.
NA,The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau ( <i>τ</i>) using the formula <i>t</i>= <i>τ</i>/2 <i>u</i>.
NA,A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
NA,Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation.
NA,No combinations were detected.
NA,The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups.
NA,By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3.
NA,The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019.
NA,Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.
NA,A global public health problem with a high rate spread and transmission, Coronavirus outbreak has become the most talked-about matter throughout the world.
NA,We are severely affected by the nations with vast numbers of deaths; it was hard to predict such a colossal pandemic with terrifying consequences.
NA,Elective surgeries are limited, but situations requiring an urgent gynaecological or obstetric surgical approach must still be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Concerns regarding surgical safety and the risk of viral transmission during surgery are of great importance.
NA,In this review, we aimed to summarize the concepts related to laparoscopic gynecological surgery during COVID-19 pandemic in the light of current literature.
NA,It's not news to tell you that the coronavirus, known as COVID-19, is a worldwide pandemic.
NA,The initial outbreak of this novel virus in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, first described in December 2019, has since moved on to being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
NA,The classic description of COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that manifests with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion.
NA,However, gastrointestinal (GI) complication of COVID-19 is emerging as well.
NA,This was observed with similar viral respiratory illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012.
NA,In a recently published, single-center case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, investigators reported that approximately 10% of patients initially presented with GI symptoms, prior to the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms.
NA,Common and often very subtle symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, with a less common symptom being nonspecific GI illness.
NA,New studies are expanding our understanding of the possible fecal transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Assessment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided evidence of the virus in the stool and the oropharynx outside the nasopharynx and respiratory tract.
NA,Virus in the stool may be evident on presentation and last throughout the course of illness resolution for up to 12 days after the respiratory virus evidence is gone.
NA,In fact, in one of the most recent studies looking at 73 patients, approximately 24% remained positive in their stool for evidence of the virus, though not necessarily infection, after showing negative in respiratory samples.
NA,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that after two negative respiratory tests separated by ≥ 24 hours, patients can be dismissed from having transmissibility infection risk for COVID-19.
NA,The potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 needs to be strongly considered.
NA,Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
NA,China has been fighting the epidemic of pneumonia-like diseases first detected for over a month in the city of Wuhan in December 2019.
NA,The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide.
NA,With a death toll approaching that of China's SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert.
NA,Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak.
NA,To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans.
NA,This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
NA,The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms.
NA,This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission.
NA,The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed.
NA,Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.
NA,COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, hitting hard on our communities.
NA,As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn.
NA,The course of an epidemic may be defined by a series of key factors.
NA,In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection.
NA,The basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection ('totally naïve'), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve.
NA,Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect.
NA,For <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, the number infected tends to increase, and for <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, transmission dies out.
NA,Non-pharmaceutical strategies to handle the epidemic are sketched and based on current knowledge, the current situation is sketched and scenarios for the near future discussed.
NA,We read with great interest the study by Siyu Chen and colleagues.
NA,The authors evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of five pregnant patients with COVID-19 at term, whose delivery was uneventful and led to favorable perinatal outcomes for both mother and neonate.
NA,We would like to draw attention to a growing body of evidence that now points towards an under-addressed association between preterm maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, preterm delivery and adverse neonatal outcomes, which is not reflected in Chen et al.'s small cohort.
NA,We also stress that vertical transmission, which was not tested for by Chen et al., should not be excluded as a potential mechanism for viral spread.
NA,Centers should therefore be meticulous in their approach to a SARS-CoV-2+ pregnancy to optimize clinical outcomes for both mother and child.

NA,The world is facing an unprecedented global pandemic in the form of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has ravaged all aspects of life, especially health systems.
NA,Radiology services, in particular, are under threat of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients affected, unless drastic efforts are taken to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus.
NA,Proactive measures, therefore, must be taken to ensure the continuation of diagnostic and interventional support to clinicians, while minimizing the risk of nosocomial transmission among staff and other patients.
NA,This article aims to highlight several strategies to improve preparedness, readiness and response towards this pandemic, specific to the radiology department.
NA,On March 30, 2020, Public Health - Seattle and King County (PHSKC) was notified of a confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a resident of a homeless shelter and day center (shelter A).
NA,Residents from two other homeless shelters (B and C) used shelter A's day center services.
NA,Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was offered to available residents and staff members at the three shelters during March 30-April 1, 2020.
NA,Among the 181 persons tested, 19 (10.5%) had positive test results (15 residents and four staff members).
NA,On April 1, PHSKC and CDC collaborated to conduct site assessments and symptom screening, isolate ill residents and staff members, reinforce infection prevention and control practices, provide face masks, and advise on sheltering-in-place.
NA,Repeat testing was offered April 7-8 to all residents and staff members who were not tested initially or who had negative test results.
NA,Among the 118 persons tested in the second round of testing, 18 (15.3%) had positive test results (16 residents and two staff members).
NA,In addition to the 31 residents and six staff members identified through testing at the shelters, two additional cases in residents were identified during separate symptom screening events, and four were identified after two residents and two staff members independently sought health care.
NA,In total, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 35 of 195 (18%) residents and eight of 38 (21%) staff members who received testing at the shelter or were evaluated elsewhere.
NA,COVID-19 can spread quickly in homeless shelters; rapid interventions including testing and isolation to identify cases and minimize transmission are necessary.
NA,CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident's heads are at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1).
NA,Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China.
NA,The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.
NA,From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts.
NA,We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital.
NA,We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.
NA,Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.
NA,As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22).
NA,Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1-5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1-2·7).
NA,Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49-26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43-34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.
NA,The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1-13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children &lt;10 years vs population average of 6·6%).
NA,The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3-0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2-7·6).
NA,Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R.
NA,The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.
NA,Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

NA,In as short as 3 months, COVID-19 has spread and ravaged the world in an unprecedented speed in modern history rivaling the 1918 flu pandemic.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the culprit virus, is highly contagious and stable in the environment and predominantly transmits among humans via the respiratory route.
NA,Accumulating evidence suggest that this virus, like many of its related viruses, may also be an enteric virus that can spread via the fecal-oral route.
NA,Such a hypothesis would also contribute to the rapidity and proliferation of this pandemic.
NA,Here we briefly summarize what is known about this family of viruses and literature basis of the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting the gastrointestinal tract and shedding in the environment for potential human-to-human transmission.
NA,The emerging global infectious COVID-19 disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China.
NA,The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution.
NA,To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance.
NA,This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes.
NA,The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome.
NA,The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates.
NA,The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic.
NA,The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations.
NA,The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations.
NA,These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.
NA,This study aimed to compare clinical courses and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19, and to assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy.
NA,Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed.
NA,The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary objective, while the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed.
NA,Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study.
NA,Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p=0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p=0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p=0.71).
NA,Of the pregnant women, 22 delivered 23 live births, either by cesarean section (17, 60.7%) or vaginal delivery (5, 17.9%), and no neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Pregnant women have comparable clinical courses and outcomes with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women when infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,No evidence supported vertical transmission of COVID-19 in the late stage of pregnancy, including vaginal delivery.
NA,Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission.
NA,If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies.
NA,In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity.
NA,First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage.
NA,Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it.
NA,Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person.
NA,This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions.
NA,Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.
NA,In this study, we aimed at analyzing the associations between transmission of and deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological variables, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation.
NA,Two outcome measures were considered, with the first aiming to study SARS-CoV-2 infections and the second aiming to study COVID-19 mortality.
NA,Daily data as well as data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world.
NA,The country's population density and time of exposure to the disease were used as control variables.
NA,Finally, a month dummy variable was added.
NA,Daily data by country were analyzed using the panel data model.
NA,An increase in the average daily temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 6.4 cases/day.
NA,There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,This association remained strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed country effects.
NA,There was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an increase in disease transmission.
NA,For each average inch/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day.
NA,COVID-19 mortality showed no significant association with temperature.
NA,Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results.
NA,As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO.
NA,COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker.
NA,Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded.
NA,The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol.
NA,Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns.
NA,Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19.
NA,This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized.
NA,All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection.
NA,During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.
NA,The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an important health problem that was defined as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020.
NA,Although great concern has been expressed about COVID-19 infection acquired through ocular transmission, its underlying mechanism has not currently been clarified.
NA,In the current work, we analyzed and elucidated the two main elements that should be taken into account to understand the &quot;ocular route&quot;, both from a clinical and molecular point of view.
NA,They are represented by the dynamism of the ocular surface system (e.g., the tear film turnover) and the distribution of ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 protein.
NA,Although it seems, at the moment, that there is a low risk of coronavirus spreading through tears, it may survive for a long time or replicate in the conjunctiva, even in absence of conjunctivitis signs, indicating that eye protection (e.g., protective goggles alone or in association with face shield) is advisable to prevent contamination from external droplets and aerosol.
NA,On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a novel coronavirus disease in China that was later named COVID-19.
NA,On 11 March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.
NA,The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on 27 February 2020.
NA,This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria.
NA,We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector), and adjusted for disease importation.
NA,By 11 April 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria.
NA,At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with a doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28-15.18).
NA,Separately for imported cases (travel-related) and local cases, the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively.
NA,Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases.
NA,The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65-8.41) at day 22 (19 March 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83-7.88) at day 25 (22 March 2020).
NA,The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26-1.58).
NA,These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.
NA,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, and the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19).
NA,This infection spreads mainly through direct contact with Flügge micro droplets or core droplets that remain suspended as aerosol.
NA,Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus.
NA,Since the infection typically enters through mouth, nose, and eyes, dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak.
NA,Considering the virus' route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection).
NA,This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices.
NA,This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice to reduce infection risk.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To summarize currently available evidence on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).<b>Material and methods:</b> PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, and CBMdisc were searched for studies reporting maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 published from 1 January 2020 to 26 March 2020.
NA,The protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/34ZAV).<b>Results:</b> In total, 18 studies comprising 114 pregnant women were included in the review.
NA,Fever (87.5%) and cough (53.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by fatigue (22.5%), diarrhea (8.8%), dyspnea (11.3%), sore throat (7.5%), and myalgia (16.3%).
NA,The majority of patients (91%) had cesarean delivery due to various indications.
NA,In terms of fetal and neonatal outcomes, stillbirth (1.2%), neonatal death (1.2%), preterm birth (21.3%), low birth weight (&lt;2500 g, 5.3%), fetal distress (10.7%), and neonatal asphyxia (1.2%) were reported.
NA,There are reports of neonatal infection, but no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission has been found.<b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of non-pregnant adults.
NA,Fetal and neonatal outcomes appear good in most cases, but available data only include pregnant women infected in their third trimesters.
NA,Further studies are needed to ascertain long-term outcomes and potential intrauterine vertical transmission.
NA,The purpose of this study was to report the clinical evaluation of a 3D-printed protective face shield designed to protect interventional radiologists from droplet transmission of the SARS-Cov-2.
NA,A protective face shield consisting in a standard transparent polymerizing vinyl chloride (PVC) sheet was built using commercially available 3D printers.
NA,The 3D-printed face shield was evaluated in 31 interventional procedures in terms of ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual, quality of visual comfort and tolerance using a Likert scale (from 1, as very good to 5, as extremely poor).
NA,The mean rating for ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual was 1.7±0.8 (SD) (range: 1-4).
NA,The mean visual tolerance rating was 1.6±0.7 (SD) (range: 1-4).
NA,The mean tolerability rating was 1.4±0.7 (SD) (range: 1-3).
NA,The 3D-printed protective face shield is well accepted in various interventions.
NA,It may become an additional option for protection of interventional radiologists.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency requiring significant changes in obstetric and gynecologic health care delivery to minimize the risk of transmission to healthy patients and health care workers.
NA,Although these changes are necessary, they will differentially affect patients in a way that highlights and exacerbates existing inequities in health care access and outcomes.
NA,Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality.
NA,Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care.
NA,Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes.
NA,As physician-leaders enact new policies to respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, it is important to consider the potential for exacerbating existing health inequities and to be proactive in creating policies that promote equity.
NA,Psychological research suggests a sense of purpose in life is a coveted asset, with well-established linkages to well-being and healthy functioning.
NA,But how do individuals preserve this sense when previously reliable settings - and the opportunities they afford - are profoundly disrupted?
NA,The current moment provides a formidable test of this question, as widespread transmission of Covid-19 and intense efforts to slow it drastically transform our environment.
NA,Here, we consider how the experience of purpose may be impacted by disruptions in three key person-environment interactions: <i>how we engage with work</i>, <i>how we engage in education</i>, and <i>how we manage physical proximity</i>.
NA,We hope to motivate critical thinking about how this pandemic, and our collective responses to it, influence the experience of purpose and delineate a research agenda that may inform how individuals' can preserve a sense of engagement and contribution.
NA,Recently, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards.
NA,With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
NA,Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.
NA,Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, while the routes of transmission of this virus are still controversial.
NA,We enrolled 33 patients, without any ocular manifestation, with their ocular surface swabs collected for virus detection.
NA,RNA was detected strong positive in samples of both eyes from two patients.
NA,Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may exist in the normal ocular surface of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that this virus might be spread through conjunctival contact.
NA,Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood.
NA,We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious.
NA,Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths.
NA,Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures.
NA,Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons <i>and</i> preventing asymptomatic transmission.
NA,Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17-45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34-58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics.
NA,Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9-18%).
NA,Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic.
NA,The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.
NA,The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic has become the biggest challenge for the whole human community since many years.
NA,It seems that the proper identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is the best strategy to limit the transmission.
NA,However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, and symptoms may be very mild or atypical.
NA,There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID‑19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms.
NA,Moreover, SARS‑CoV‑2 particles were found in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of patients with COVID‑19.
NA,These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement.
NA,Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.
NA,Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
NA,This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.
NA,The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility are yet to be fully understood.
NA,Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies.
NA,To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset.
NA,This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts.
NA,The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020.
NA,All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case.
NA,During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test.
NA,The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020.
NA,Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care).
NA,We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 56 men and 44 women.
NA,Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases.
NA,The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%).
NA,The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%).
NA,The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]).
NA,The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings.
NA,The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]).
NA,In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.
NA,This article analyzes the available evidence to address airborne, aerosol transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We review and present three lines of evidence: case reports of transmission for asymptomatic individuals in association with studies that show that normal breathing and talking produce predominantly small droplets of the size that are subject to aerosol transport; limited empirical data that have recorded aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 particles that remain suspended in the air for hours and are subject to transport over distances including outside of rooms and intrabuilding, and the broader literature that further supports the importance of aerosol transmission of infectious diseases.
NA,The weight of the available evidence warrants immediate attention to address the significance of aerosols and implications for public health protection.
NA,During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals are at the forefront of managing the highly infectious coronavirus.
NA,As the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation, it is critical for healthcare workers to have the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks and goggles.
NA,Surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and SARS, so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols from entering the respiratory system.
NA,Therefore, it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets, aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose.
NA,Various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings, such as half-mask filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).
NA,The most commonly used FFR is the N95 disposable respirator, which is tight fitting and has a 95% or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 µm.
NA,This review discusses respirators, their purpose, types, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.
NA,The current outbreak of COVID-19 severe respiratory disease, which started in Wuhan, China, is an ongoing challenge, and a major threat to public health that requires surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand this emergent pathogen and to develop an effective response.
NA,Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines.
NA,Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens.
NA,Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights.
NA,Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
NA,In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
NA,Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
NA,Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
NA,The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an influenza-like disease that is primarily thought to infect the lungs with transmission via the respiratory route.
NA,However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ.
NA,Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes.
NA,In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by confocal- and electron-microscopy.
NA,Consequently, significant titers of infectious viral particles were detected. mRNA expression analysis revealed strong induction of a generic viral response program.
NA,Hence, intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hSIOs serve as an experimental model for coronavirus infection and biology.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has raised concern of transmission of infectious organisms through aerosols formation in endonasal and transoral surgery.
NA,Retrospective review.
NA,We introduce the negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce the risk of aerosol.
NA,NOVID consists of a plastic drape suspended above the patient's head and surgical field with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber.
NA,Four patients underwent endonasal (4) and endo-oral surgery (1).
NA,Fluorescein was applied to the surgical field.
NA,Black light examination of fluorescein-treated operative fields revealed minimal contamination distant to the surgical field.
NA,In two prolonged cases with high-speed drilling, droplets were identified under the barrier and on the tip of the smoke evacuator.
NA,Instruments and cottonoids appeared to be a greater contributor to field contamination.
NA,Negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier, which appears to successfully keep aerosol and droplet contamination to a minimum.
NA,This study describes a novel approach in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy.
NA,Five patients underwent tracheostomy between April 1, 2020 and April 17, 2020.
NA,A clear and sterile plastic drape was used as an additional physical barrier against droplets and aerosols.
NA,Operative diagnosis; droplet count and distribution on plastic sheet and face shields were documented.
NA,Tracheostomy was performed for patients with carcinoma of tonsil (n = 2) and nasopharynx (n = 1), and aspiration pneumonia (n = 2).
NA,Droplet contamination was noted on all plastic sheets (n = 5).
NA,Droplet contamination was most severe over the central surface at 91.5% (86.7%-100.0%) followed by the left and right lateral surfaces at 5.2% (6.7%-10.0%) and 3.3% (6.7%-10.0%), respectively.
NA,No droplet contamination was noted on all face shields.
NA,Plastic drapes can help reduce viral transmission to health care providers during tracheostomy.
NA,Face shields may be spared which in turn helps to conserve resources during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
NA,Spain has been one of the most affected countries by the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,As of April 28, 2020, the number of confirmed cases is 210 773, including 102 548 patients recovered, more than 10 300 admitted to the ICU, and 23 822 deaths, with a global case fatality rate of 11.3%.
NA,From the perspective of donation and transplantation, the Spanish system first focused on safety issues, providing recommendations for donor evaluation and testing, and to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in potential recipients prior to transplantation.
NA,Since the country entered into an epidemiological scenario of sustained community transmission and saturation of intensive care, developing donation and transplantation procedures has become highly complex.
NA,Since the national state of alarm was declared in Spain on March 13, 2020, the mean number of donors has declined from 7.2 to 1.2 per day, and the mean number of transplants from 16.1 to 2.1 per day.
NA,Increased mortality on the waiting list may become a collateral damage of this terrible pandemic.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has urged the development and implementation of guidelines and protocols on diagnosis, management, infection control strategies, and discharge planning.
NA,However, very little is currently known about neonatal COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.
NA,Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation.
NA,Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW.
NA,In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population.
NA,The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes.
NA,The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear.
NA,Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists.
NA,Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure.
NA,As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.
NA,KEY POINTS: · Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic urged development of guidelines..
NA,· Neonatal COVID-19 disease is uncommon..
NA,· Respiratory outcomes in neonates seems favorable..
NA,· Current neonatal respiratory care should continue..
NA,· Clinicians should watch frequently for updates..
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was first reported in central China in December 2019.
NA,Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA-positive cases from 1.6 million tests.
NA,In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches.
NA,Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic.
NA,Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures.
NA,Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased.
NA,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency of international concern.
NA,With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective.
NA,Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission.
NA,Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals.
NA,We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.
NA,COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic in March 2020.
NA,It has impacted the world medically, financially, politically and socially, with countries such as China and Italy adopting a full lockdown of their cities to mitigate the transmission.
NA,The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide.
NA,The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate.
NA,As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline.
NA,Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill.
NA,At the same time, delaying treatment such as radiotherapy in cancer patients can be detrimental.
NA,Here, we describe our experience as a large radiation oncology department in Singapore, including the challenges we encountered and how we managed our patient flow.
NA,Anatomically, viral density is greater in the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx.
NA,It is to be expected that instrumentation in or through those areas will entail a higher risk of transmission.
NA,That's why head and neck and otolaryngologist surgeons are among the most vulnerable health professionals.
NA,Surgeons should essentially perform procedures they require.
NA,Surgeries should be performed with personal protective equipment suitable for the high risk of aerosolization: goggles, N95 face mask, facial mask, blood-repelling gown and gloves.
NA,It is advisable to have the cooperative COVID-19 test in all patients.
NA,Telemedicine is a useful resource if resources allow it.
NA,Otolaryngologists and related specialists are among the groups at higher risk when performing surgeries and upper airway examinations.
NA,There are no emergencies in a pandemic.
NA,The care of health professionals is crucial to combating this health situation.
NA,The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei, China, spreads across national and international borders.
NA,We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China.
NA,Among the 14 HCWs, 12 were conformed cases, the other 2 were suspected cases.
NA,Most of them were either exposed to the two index patients or infected coworkers, without knowing they were COVID-19 patients.
NA,There were 4 male and 10 female infected HCWs in this cohort, whose mean age was 36 years (SD, 6 years).
NA,The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%).
NA,On admission, 79% of infected HCWs showed leucopenia and 43% lymphopenia.
NA,Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs and IL-6 was significantly elevated in 86% of them.
NA,The proportion of lymphocytes subsets, concentrations of immunoglobulins, complement C4, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ were within normal range in these 14 infected HCWs.
NA,The most frequent findings on pulmonary computed tomographic images were bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacifications (86%).
NA,Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia has occurred among HCWs, and most of these infected HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 are mild cases.
NA,Our data suggest that in the epidemic area of COVID-19, stringent and urgent surveillance and infection-control measures should be implemented to protect doctors and nurses from COVID-19 infection.
NA,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea.
NA,However, digestive symptoms have also been reported.
NA,At first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect more than half of patients.
NA,The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain.
NA,Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection.
NA,Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign.
NA,The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases.
NA,Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images consistent with COVID-19 infection.
NA,No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.
NA,Moreover, the endoscopists may themselves be at significant risk of contamination.
NA,Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.
NA,In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.
NA,In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established.
NA,Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.
NA,Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.
NA,Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern society.
NA,As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission.
NA,Scoping review of literature examining microbial's presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings.
NA,A search (PubMed&amp;GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005-December 2019 to identify English language studies.
NA,Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community.
NA,Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded.
NA,A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries).
NA,Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi.
NA,One study focused solely on RNA viruses.
NA,Staphylococcus aureus, and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones.
NA,These two species and Escherichia coli were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples.
NA,Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter sp., and Bacillus sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings.
NA,While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a 'Trojan horse' contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics.
NA,Chinese pediatricians are working on the front line to fight COVID-19.
NA,They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data.
NA,Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children.
NA,The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world.
NA,By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed.
NA,It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults.
NA,These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children.
NA,Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples.
NA,There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis.
NA,Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19.
NA,COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed.
NA,Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families.
NA,Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children.
NA,The purpose of this perspective is to review the options countries have to exit the draconian &quot;lockdowns&quot; in a carefully staged manner.
NA,Experts from different countries experiencing Corona Virus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) reviewed evidence and country-specific approaches and the results of their interventions.
NA,Three factors are essential: 1.
NA,Reintroduction from countries with ongoing community transmission; 2.
NA,The need for extensive testing capacity and widespread community testing, and 3.
NA,An adequate supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, to protect health care workers.
NA,Discussed at length are lifting physical distancing, how to open manufacturing and construction, logistics, and the opening of higher educational institutions and schools.
NA,The use of electronic surveillance is considered.
NA,Each country should decide on the best path forward.
NA,However, we can learn from each other, and the approaches are, in reality, very similar.
NA,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide through person-to-person contact, causing a public health emergency of international concern.
NA,At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities.
NA,However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response.
NA,The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay.
NA,The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS.
NA,Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
NA,The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
NA,Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα.
NA,These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.
NA,A pandemic of a novel Coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing devastating public health impact across the world.
NA,In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public.
NA,We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies.
NA,Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by ℛ<sub>c</sub>), is less than unity.
NA,Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively.
NA,The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020.
NA,The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented.
NA,The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy ≥ 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks).
NA,The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination).
NA,Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic.
NA,This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19.
NA,Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19.
NA,Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high.
NA,The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.
NA,Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19.
NA,Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea.
NA,The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey.
NA,Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.
NA,Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission.
NA,Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172).
NA,Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea.
NA,Fever (&gt;37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals.
NA,As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission.
NA,Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not.
NA,Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.
NA,A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
NA,Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors.
NA,No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan.
NA,We collected 626 surface swabs within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020.
NA,Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major PPE.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR.
NA,The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%).
NA,We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels.
NA,The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%).
NA,Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were the most contaminated PPE.
NA,Our findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,In the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social distancing has been necessary to help prevent disease transmission.
NA,As a result, medical practices have limited access to in-person visits.
NA,This poses a challenge to maintain appropriate patient care while preventing a substantial backlog of patients once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted.
NA,In practices that are naïve to telehealth as an alternative option, providers and staff are experiencing challenges with telemedicine implementation.
NA,We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic.
NA,We built a toolkit that details the following 8 essential components to successful implementation of a telemedicine platform: provider and staff training, patient education, an existing electronic medical record system, patient and provider investment in hardware, billing and coding integration, information technology support, audiovisual platforms, and patient and caregiver participation.
NA,Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution's COVID-19 task force.
NA,Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation.
NA,Effective and efficient integration of a telemedicine program requires extensive staff and patient education, accessory platforms to facilitate video and audio communication, and adoption of new billing codes that are outlined in this toolkit.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the globe and is causing significant morbidity and mortality.
NA,Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs).
NA,The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs.
NA,▪▪▪ STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission.
NA,MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion.
NA,Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation.
NA,When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process.
NA,The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements.
NA,The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse.
NA,To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections.
NA,In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.
NA,Since early December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases associated with unknown coronavirus infection were identified in Wuhan, China, and many additional cases were identified in other regions of China and in other countries within 3 months.
NA,Currently, more than 80,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, including more than 3000 deaths.
NA,The epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world, posing a grave challenge to prevention and control.
NA,On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.
NA,According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems.
NA,In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue.
NA,The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus.
NA,Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases.
NA,However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil.
NA,This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil.
NA,Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19.
NA,A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases.
NA,Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil.
NA,The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C.
NA,Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated with a -4.8951% (t = -2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
NA,A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model.
NA,The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053.
NA,In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C.
NA,Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases.
NA,The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C.
NA,There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C.
NA,The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.
NA,Clinical and epidemiological evidence has been advanced for human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus rampaging the world since late 2019.
NA,Outliers in the human-to-human transmission are yet to be explored.
NA,In this study, we examined the spatial density and leaned statistical credence to the global debate.
NA,We constructed spatial variations of clusters that examined the nexus between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases.
NA,We rely on publicly available data on confirmed cases and death across Africa to unravel the unobserved factors, that could be responsible for the spread of COVID-19.
NA,We relied on the dynamic system generalised method of moment estimation procedure and found a ~0.045 Covid19 deaths as a result of confirmed cases in Africa.
NA,We accounted for cross-sectional dependence and found a basis for the strict orthogonal relationship.
NA,Policy measures were discussed.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge facing the world.
NA,Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial.
NA,This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public.
NA,Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020.
NA,Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density.
NA,Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths.
NA,A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths.
NA,The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used.
NA,These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases.
NA,However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.
NA,The world is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions caused by a corona virus named SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedent worldwide measures being taken to tackle its contagion.
NA,Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed.
NA,Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection.
NA,Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure.
NA,However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS.
NA,The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship.
NA,Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission.
NA,Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.
NA,Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
NA,The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact.
NA,However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified.
NA,This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments.
NA,A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection.
NA,This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review.
NA,In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters.
NA,The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C-25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments.
NA,The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.
NA,Coronaviruses primarily cause zoonotic infections, however in the past few decades several interspecies transmissions have occurred, the last one by SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 pandemic, posing serious threat to global health.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays an important role in viral attachment, fusion and entry.
NA,However, other structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins are potential influencers in virus pathogenicity.
NA,Among these proteins; Orf3, Orf8, and Orf10 show the least homology to SARSCoV proteins and therefore should be further studied for their abilities to modulate antiviral and inflammatory responses.
NA,Here, we discuss how SARS-COV-2 interacts with our immune system.
NA,The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time.
NA,Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge.
NA,Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020).
NA,According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces.
NA,In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed.
NA,The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
NA,The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm.
NA,Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.
NA,Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials.
NA,There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units.
NA,Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions.
NA,Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments.
NA,Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes.
NA,By the 1<sup>st</sup> of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine.
NA,Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support.
NA,The new era of nuclear medicine practice worldwide coincides with a new era for the Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine (HSNM) and the Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine (HJNM).
NA,The founder and Editor in Chief for more than 28 consecutive years, Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos, resigned leaving behind a benchmark for the presidencies and editors to come.
NA,His commitment to the conservation of a high level of scientific excellence of the published papers is the legacy which we wish to maintain in the future publications.
NA,The interim Editor in Chief of the current issue, would like to express her gratitude to Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos for his contribution to the global scientific community as well as to the incoming Editor in Chief Konstantinos Anagnostopoulos, MD, PhD, FRCP, FESC for accepting this new role.
NA,We wholeheartedly welcome the new Editor in Chief and the new members of the Editorial Board, wishing them an active, attentive and successful mandate.
NA,Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine will remain true to the set principles, values and past and prepared to cope with future challenges in the scientific and clinical setting.
NA,With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic.
NA,Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.
NA,A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted.
NA,Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation.
NA,Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments.
NA,Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.
NA,Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes.
NA,By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes.
NA,Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p&lt;0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (&gt;10 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) and neutrophilia (&gt;75 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes.
NA,By contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (p&lt;0.001), which was confirmed by survival analysis.
NA,Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19.
NA,We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.
NA,Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.
NA,Oral swabs, sputum, and blood samples from 18 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined using RT-PCR testing in order to assess the risk of transfusion-related transmission.
NA,In asymptomatic patients as well as patients with flu-like symptoms and fever, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the blood or serum despite a clearly positive result in all throat swabs.
NA,As patients with symptoms of infectious disease will not be admitted to blood donation, the risk for transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be negligible.
NA,The 2019-nCoV outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019(1).
NA,This unprecedented virus has caused global pandemic and over 2,300,000 cases worldwide in total number(2), which has been bringing tremendous pressure and challenges to medical institutions and clinical staff around the world. 2019-nCoV can be transmitted by droplets primarily, while it has been reported that surface contact transmission exists as well(3).
NA,Keeping the integrity of skin barrier is a critical method to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV, since skin is the first line of defense of human body(4).
NA,It is of prime importance to ensure and maintain the skin clean, sterilized and protected of clinical health care staff during the fight against the epidemic.
NA,Self-protection of the medical staff is essential, however, utilizing protective equipment such as goggles, masks and protective clothing continuously impairs skin integrity and the skin damage caused by the respective protective measures must be taken seriously.
NA,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 26 April 2020: notifications = 6,711; deaths = 77.
NA,The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia.
NA,Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected.
NA,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case.
NA,The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction.
NA,The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%).
NA,The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases.
NA,High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission.
NA,Internationally, cases continue to increase.
NA,The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.
NA,Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.
NA,On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has presented rapid person-to-person transmission and is currently a global pandemic.
NA,In the largest number of cases described to date of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease (2019-nCoViD), 26% required care in an intensive care unit (ICU).
NA,This pandemic is causing an unprecedented mobilization of the scientific community, which has been associated with an exponentially growing number of publications in relation to it.
NA,This narrative literature review aims to gather the main contributions in the area of intensive care to date in relation to the epidemiology, clinic, diagnosis and management of 2019-nCoViD.
NA,The use of medical masks and respirators as personal protective equipment is pivotal to reducing the level of biological hazard to which healthcare workers are exposed during the outbreak of highly diffusible pathogens, such as the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Unfortunately, during this pandemic, supplies are rapidly running out worldwide, with potential consequences for the rate of occupational infections.
NA,Also, knowledge about specific characteristics of respirators is of utmost importance to select the proper type according to the clinical setting.
NA,A wide variety of literature is available on the topic, but mostly based on Influenza viruses infection models.
NA,Clinical evidence on the use of respirators is poor and interest in the topic has not been constant over time.
NA,A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed, together with high-quality clinical data on the use of respirators or alternative devices.
NA,Moreover, healthcare workers, regardless of their level of experience, should receive specific training.
NA,This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the use of medical masks and respirators in the context of viral infections, especially the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,In Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, clinical examination and invasive procedures on the respiratory tract and on airway-connected cavities, such as paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, expose people to direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation or ocular projection of contaminated droplets, and to indirect transmission by contact with contaminated hands, objects or surfaces.
NA,Estimating an R<sub>0</sub> of COVID-19 at around 3 justified postponing non-urgent face-to-face consultations and expanding the use of teleconsultation in order to limit the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health workers and comply with the lockdown.
NA,The health authority recommends cancellation of all medical or surgical activities, which are not urgent as long as this does not involve a loss of chance for the patient.
NA,The purpose of this cancellation is to significantly increase critical care capacity, prioritise the reception of patients with COVID-19, prioritise the allocation of staff and provision of the equipment necessary for their medical or surgical management, and contribute to the smooth running of downstream critical care within their establishment.
NA,Another goal is to reduce the risks of patient contamination within healthcare facilities.
NA,This document provides guidance on how to proceed with and adapt ENT surgery in the current pandemic context, as well as on the management of postponed operations.
NA,This best practice advice must of course be adapted in each region according to the development of the epidemic and pre-existing arrangements.
NA,Their local application can only be decided within the framework of collaboration between the ENT teams, the operational hygiene units and all the other specialties concerned.
NA,A novel coronavirus (nCoV) spillover event, with its epicenter in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, has emerged as a public health emergency of international concern.
NA,This began as an outbreak in December 2019, and till February 28, 2020, there have been 83,704 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, with 2,859 deaths, resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 3.41 per cent (95% confidence interval 3.29-3.54%).
NA,By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) were affected.
NA,As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus.
NA,This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India.
NA,Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts.
NA,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats.
NA,The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised urgent questions about containment and mitigation, particularly in countries where the virus has not yet established human-to-human transmission.
NA,The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?
NA,These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission.
NA,While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps.
NA,It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms.
NA,In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent.
NA,In the pessimistic scenario of R<sub>0</sub>=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent.
NA,Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community.
NA,Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer.
NA,Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden.
NA,Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus.
NA,As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.
NA,Sentinel surveillance among severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients can help identify the spread and extent of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in India.
NA,We describe here the positivity for COVID-19 among SARI patients and their characteristics.
NA,SARI patients admitted at 41 sentinel sites from February 15, 2020 onwards were tested for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, targeting E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Data were extracted from Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network for analysis.
NA,A total of 104 (1.8%) of the 5,911 SARI patients tested were positive for COVID-19.
NA,These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 States/Union Territories.
NA,The COVID-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years.
NA,In all, 40 (39.2%) COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel.
NA,COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting COVID-19 cases among SARI patients.
NA,Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts.
NA,World Health Organization (WHO) declared novel coronavirus outbreak a &quot;pandemic&quot; on March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020.
NA,India has already reached Stage 2 (local transmission) and the Indian Government, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is taking all necessary steps to halt the community transmission(Stage 3).
NA,Anaesthesiologists and intensivists around the globe are making untiring efforts akin to soldiers at the final frontier during war.
NA,All efforts pertaining to adequate staffing, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and strict adherence to hand hygiene measures are being stressed upon to prevent in-hospital transmission.
NA,In this article, all outbreak response measures including triaging, preparation of isolation rooms, decontamination and disinfection protocols as well as fundamental principles of critical care and anaesthetic management in Covid-19 cases is being discussed.
NA,All the recommendations have been derived from the past experiences of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak as well as upcoming guidelines from the international health fraternity and Indian Health Services.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused infection in 168,000 cases worldwide in about 148 countries and killed more than 6,610 people around the world as of March 16, 2020, as per the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, there is the rapid transmission, long incubation period, and disease containment is becoming extremely difficult.
NA,The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers.
NA,We also discussed various preventive measures to combat COVID-19 effectively.
NA,A systematic and protocol-driven approach is needed to contain this disease, which was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the WHO.
NA,We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features, and medical care-seeking process of patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, to provide useful information to contain COVID-19 in other places with similar outbreaks of the virus.
NA,We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020.
NA,The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed.
NA,Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission.
NA,It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later.
NA,After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus.
NA,Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks' isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.
NA,The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a plethora of guidance and opinion from surgical societies.
NA,A controversial area concerns the safety of surgically created smoke and the perceived potential higher risk in laparoscopic surgery.
NA,The limited published evidence was analysed in combination with expert opinion.
NA,A review was undertaken of the novel coronavirus with regards to its hazards within surgical smoke and the procedures that could mitigate the potential risks to healthcare staff.
NA,Using existing knowledge of surgical smoke, a theoretical risk of virus transmission exists.
NA,Best practice should consider the operating room set-up, patient movement and operating theatre equipment when producing a COVID-19 operating protocol.
NA,The choice of energy device can affect the smoke produced, and surgeons should manage the pneumoperitoneum meticulously during laparoscopic surgery.
NA,Devices to remove surgical smoke, including extractors, filters and non-filter devices, are discussed in detail.
NA,There is not enough evidence to quantify the risks of COVID-19 transmission in surgical smoke.
NA,However, steps can be undertaken to manage the potential hazards.
NA,The advantages of minimally invasive surgery may not need to be sacrificed in the current crisis.
NA,Recent epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop).
NA,SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious.
NA,Critical knowledge gaps include the relative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the public health interventions that prevent asymptomatic transmission, and the question of whether asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protective immunity.
NA,The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a public health emergency; at present, India is facing a major threat of community spread.
NA,We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India.
NA,The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India.
NA,A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries.
NA,After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days.
NA,We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown.
NA,The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries.
NA,For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown.
NA,Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement.
NA,Finally, for the scenario of &quot;panic shopping&quot; or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy.
NA,Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
NA,However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India.
NA,Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.
NA,We report early findings from COVID-19 cases in Brunei suggesting a remarkably high proportion of asymptomatic (12%) and presymptomatic (30%) cases.
NA,This proportion was even higher in imported cases.
NA,These have implications for measures to prevent onward local transmission and should prompt reconsideration of current testing protocols and safe de-escalation of social distancing measures.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 and then spread throughout the world rapidly.
NA,The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells.
NA,ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7).
NA,We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility.
NA,The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta.
NA,Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists.
NA,Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development.
NA,Taking these functions into account, 2019-nCoV may disturb the female reproductive functions through regulating ACE2.
NA,COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with a high fatality rate that may reach 8%.
NA,The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is one of the coronaviruses.
NA,Realizing the severity of outcomes associated with this disease and its high rate of transmission, dentists were instructed by regulatory authorities, such as the American Dental Association, to stop providing treatment to dental patients except those who have emergency complaints.
NA,This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment.
NA,Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared.
NA,This overview will address several issues concerned with the COVID-19 pandemic that directly relate to dental practice in terms of prevention, treatment, and orofacial clinical manifestations.
NA,Epistaxis is a common complaint in the general population, and its treatment is a common procedure in emergency departments.
NA,In the COVID-19 era, procedures involving airway management are a particular risk for health care workers due to the high virulence of the virus, the transmission through aerosol, and the risk of contagion from asymptomatic patients.
NA,In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management.
NA,The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection.
NA,In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department.
NA,The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.
NA,In this commentary, we briefly summarize the available data from Iran and other countries on the sudden increase in anosmia, hyposmia, and hypogeusia that has coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Alarmingly, a high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 had isolated anosmia as the sole initial presenting symptom, which is likely due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and obstruction.
NA,Since isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for COVID-19, we wish to raise awareness on the association of anosmia with COVID-19, urging international and national health authorities to consider this association in their efforts for early detection and isolation of infected individuals and for breaking the chain of transmission.
NA,We urge our colleagues who assess patients with new-onset anosmia to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines to reduce the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic.
NA,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected over 3300 health-care-workers (HCWs) in early 2020 in China.
NA,Little information is known about nosocomial infections of HCWs in the initial period.
NA,We analysed data from HCWs with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital and their family members.
NA,We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines, and epidemiologic characteristics of 25 laboratory-confirmed and two highly suspected HCWs as well as ten of their family members with COVID-19 from Jan 5 to Feb 12, 2020.
NA,Among them, demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed.
NA,Nine clusters were found among the patients.
NA,All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration.
NA,The average periods of incubation, clinical onset serial interval (COSI), and virus shedding were 4.5 days, 5.2±3.2 days, and 18.5 days, respectively.
NA,Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure with small, irrelevant mutations was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted person-to-person regardless of whether they have symptoms in both hospital settings and social activities based on the short period of incubation and COSI.
NA,The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close-contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas.
NA,Besides, the HCWs should be alert during the epidemic, and make self-quarantine if self-suspected.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, a novel emerging coronavirus, has caused severe disease (COVID-19), and rapidly spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads by coughing, sneezing, droplet inhalation, and contact.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID-19.
NA,The participants in dental practice confront a particular risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to close contact with the patients and potential exposure to saliva-contaminated droplets and aerosols generated during dental procedures.
NA,In addition, saliva-contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross-infection.
NA,Hence, the control of saliva-related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID-19.
NA,Based on our experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva-related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners.
NA,To explore the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 associated with SARS-Cov-2 in Guizhou province, and to compare the differences in epidemiology with other provinces.
NA,The data were extracted from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, Health Commission of Guizhou province, and Health Commission of Hubei province from January 20 to February 12, 2020.
NA,Information included such as general demographic indicators, population data and clinical outcome.
NA,A total of 135 cases were analyzed in the study.
NA,The average age was 39.46±18.95 years.
NA,The ratio of males to females was 0.985:1.
NA,Most of COVID-19 patients were 18-45 years old (52.27%).
NA,Close contact history was the most common (37.88%), followed by residence history in Hubei (34.85%).
NA,There was no difference between males and females in age (P=0.953) and exposure condition (P=0.186).
NA,Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the migration index and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.816, P=0.007).
NA,Among the cases, most patients were young adults.
NA,Most epidemiological characteristics were no difference between males and females.
NA,Family-based transmission should not be ignored, as a close contact history was the top reason of exposure.
NA,Moreover, population movements also had significant impact on outbreaks.
NA,Rapid transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,The current emphasis is on preventive strategies such as social distancing, face mask, and hand washing.
NA,The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections.
NA,In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
NA,We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19.
NA,The present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world and now affects more people within the United States than any other country.
NA,New York City has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States.
NA,Both locally and across the country, there is great concern in our ability to deliver appropriate medical care during this time.
NA,Radiation therapy is another essential clinical service that cannot afford to suffer prolonged delays without compromising patient outcomes.
NA,Early action and guidance are therefore critical to minimize transmission events and ensure safe and timely delivery of radiation therapy.
NA,The New York Proton Center (NYPC) is a high-volume free-standing multi-institutional proton center located in Manhattan.
NA,The purpose of this report is to describe the institutional patient experience and quantify the impact of treatment delays and interruptions over the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,We also quantify the incidence of COVID-19 positive patients on census and provide guidance on proactive institutional policies to mitigate patient risk.
NA,The pneumonia caused by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.
NA,The gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and the detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid from fecal specimens in a small number of patients suggest the possibility of transmission <i>via</i> the gastrointestinal tract.
NA,People of all ages are vulnerable to this virus, including children.
NA,Digestive endoscopy is an invasive procedure during which children cannot wear masks; therefore, they have higher risks of exposure to COVID-19, and the digestive endoscopy center is a relatively high-risk area for COVID-19 infection.
NA,Based on these factors and in combination with related policies and regulations, a prevention and control program for the COVID-19 pneumonia in a children's digestive endoscopy center was established to prevent the COVID-19 nosocomial infection.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that can transmit through respiratory droplets, aerosols, or contacts.
NA,Frequent touching of contaminated surfaces in public areas is therefore a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,The inanimate surfaces have often been described as a source of nosocomial infections.
NA,However, summaries on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to induce the coronavirus disease 2019 are rare at present.
NA,This review aims to summarize data on the persistence of different coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces.
NA,The literature was systematically searched on Medline without language restrictions.
NA,All reports with experimental evidence on the duration persistence of coronaviruses on any type of surface were included.
NA,Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as coronaviruses, influenza, SARS-CoV, or rhinovirus, can persist on surfaces for a few days.
NA,Persistence time on inanimate surfaces varied from minutes to up to one month, depending on the environmental conditions.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 can be sustained in air in closed unventilated buses for at least 30 min without losing infectivity.
NA,The most common coronaviruses may well survive or persist on surfaces for up to one month.
NA,Viruses in respiratory or fecal specimens can maintain infectivity for quite a long time at room temperature.
NA,Absorbent materials like cotton are safer than unabsorbent materials for protection from virus infection.
NA,The risk of transmission <i>via</i> touching contaminated paper is low.
NA,Preventive strategies such as washing hands and wearing masks are critical to the control of coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers.
NA,Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important.
NA,Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals.
NA,However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case.
NA,A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization.
NA,She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence.
NA,But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, <i>etc</i>.
NA,On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation.
NA,The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 1.04 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, respectively.
NA,CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity.
NA,The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture.
NA,On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated.
NA,On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced.
NA,Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized.
NA,Both conditions require effective prompt actions, especially COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become an unprecedented pandemic that has impacted society, disrupted hospital functions, strained healthcare resources and impacted the lives of transplant professionals.
NA,Despite this, organ failure and the need for transplantation continues throughout the United States.
NA,Considering the perpetual scarcity of deceased donor organs, Kates et al present a viewpoint that advocates for the utilization of COVID-19 positive donors in selected cases.
NA,We present a review of the current literature that details the potential negative consequences of COVID-19 positive donors.
NA,The factors we consider include: 1) the risk of blood transmission SARS-CoV-2, 2) involvement of donor organs, 3) lack of effective therapies, 4) exposure of healthcare and recovery teams, 5) disease transmission and propagation, and 6) hospital resource utilization.
NA,While we acknowledge that transplantation fulfills the mission of saving lives, it is imperative to consider the consequences not only to our recipients, but also to the community and to healthcare workers, particularly in the absence of effective preventative or curative therapies.
NA,For these reasons, we believe the evidence and risks show that COVID-19 infection should continue to remain a contraindication for donation, as has been the initial response of donation and transplantation societies.
NA,Even though the early reports from China provided advance warning of what was to come, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world with devastating consequences.
NA,Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease.
NA,Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale.
NA,Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm.
NA,The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.
NA,Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities.
NA,This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness.
NA,Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 23, 2020.
NA,Patients were confirmed by PCR test.
NA,Demographic, clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed.
NA,Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases who were immigrated from Wuhan; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections.
NA,Family clusters were the major body of patients.
NA,Transmission along the chain of 3 &quot;generations&quot; was observed.
NA,Five asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives.
NA,Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years and 49 (47.12%) were male.
NA,The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days, 96 (92.31%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died.
NA,Average hospital stay was 10 (rang, 8-14) days.
NA,Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers, suggesting the timely control measures after the Wuhan shutdown wok well.
NA,Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19.
NA,A 14-day quarantine may need to be prolonged.

NA,To determine the pooled global prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
NA,Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as <i>anosmia, dysgeusia</i>, and <i>COVID-19</i>.
NA,Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening.
NA,Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed.
NA,Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated.
NA,Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19.
NA,Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
NA,Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.
NA,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
NA,Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
NA,To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus produces the disease called COVID-19, currently spreading in a rapidly evolving pandemic.
NA,It can be transmitted by contact, drops and aerosols, and has been isolated from gastrointestinal secretions and faeces.
NA,During digestive endoscopy, transmission by any of these mechanisms could occur.
NA,It is recommended to limit digestive endoscopy to cases of digestive bleeding, severe dysphagia, foreign body in the digestive tract, biliary obstruction with intractable pain or cholangitis, pseudocyst or complicated encapsulated pancreatic necrosis, gastrointestinal obstruction, and cases at risk of deterioration over time.
NA,It is recommended to screen patients based on temperature, symptoms, and epidemiological factors to classify them according to their risk of infection.
NA,For procedures in low risk patients, personnel must wear a disposable gown, gloves, eye or face shield, standard surgical mask, disposable hat, disposable shoe covers.
NA,In cases of intermediate or high risk, or confirmed COVID-19, protection should be increased using disposable waterproof gown, N95 respirator or similar, and double glove.
NA,In case of shortage it may be necessary to reuse N95 respirators for up to 5 uses, following CDC recommendations for donning, removing and storing to prevent secondary contact contamination.
NA,Likewise, all protective equipment should be put on and removed according to CDC recommendations.
NA,The presence of personnel in endoscopy should be limited to the bare minimum.
NA,Said personnel must have daily temperature control and if it is above 37.3ºC, the corresponding evaluation must be carried out.
NA,After each procedure, the stretcher and room surfaces should be properly disinfected.
NA,High-level disinfection of endoscopes eliminates SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Interventions targeting symptomatic hosts and their contacts were successful in bringing the 2003 SARS pandemic under control.
NA,In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts.
NA,Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms.
NA,Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective.
NA,However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures.
NA,A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high.
NA,Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully.
NA,This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.
NA,Analysis of the temporal, seasonal and demographic distribution of dengue virus (DENV) infections in Barbados was conducted using national surveillance data from a total of 3994 confirmed dengue cases.
NA,Diagnosis was confirmed either by DENV-specific real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), or non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; a case fatality rate of 0.4% (10/3994) was observed.
NA,The prevalence rate of dengue fever (DF) varied from 27.5 to 453.9 cases per 100,000 population among febrile patients who sought medical attention annually.
NA,DF cases occurred throughout the year with low level of transmission observed during the dry season (December to June), then increased transmission during rainy season (July to November) peaking in October.
NA,Three major dengue epidemics occurred in Barbados during 2010, 2013 and possibly 2016 with an emerging three-year interval.
NA,DF prevalence rate among febrile patients who sought medical attention overall was highest among the 10-19 years old age group.
NA,The highest DF hospitalisation prevalence rate was observed in 2013.
NA,Multiple serotypes circulated during the study period and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was the most prevalent serotype during 2010, whilst DENV-1 was the most prevalent serotype in 2013.
NA,Two DENV-1 strains from the 2013 DENV epidemic were genetically more closely related to South East Asian strains, than Caribbean or South American strains, and represent the first ever sequencing of DENV strains in Barbados.
NA,However, the small sample size (<i>n =</i> 2) limits any meaningful conclusions.
NA,DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males.
NA,Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.
NA,The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados.
NA,The number of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019) cases in Jordan is rising rapidly.
NA,A serious threat to the healthcare system appears on the horizon.
NA,Our study aims to evaluate preparedness of Jordanian frontline doctors to the worsening scenario.
NA,It has a questionnaire-based cross-sectional structure.
NA,The questionnaire was designed to evaluate preparedness according to knowledge about virus transmission and protective measures, adherence to protection guidelines, and psychological impacts affecting doctors.
NA,Institutional factors affecting doctors' readiness like adopting approach protocols and making protection equipment available were investigated; 308 doctors from different healthcare facilities participated (response rate: 53.9%).
NA,Approximately 25% of doctors (n = 77) previously took care of COVID-19 patients, and 173 (56.2%) have institutional COVID-19 approach protocols.
NA,Only 57 doctors (18.5%) reported all PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) available.
NA,The self-reported score of preparedness to deal with COVID-19 patients was 4.9 ± 2.4.
NA,Doctors having institutional protocols for dealing with COVID-19 cases and those with sustained availability of PPE reported higher scores of preparedness (5.5 ± 2.3 and 6.2 ± 2.1 with <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively).
NA,Correlations with knowledge score, adherence to PPE score, and psychological impacts were investigated.
NA,The study revealed multiple challenges and insufficiencies that can affect frontline doctors' preparedness.
NA,Policy makers are urged to take these findings into consideration and to act promptly.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) virus is challenging healthcare providers across the world.
NA,Current best practices for personal protective equipment (PPE) during this time are rapidly evolving and fluid due to the novel and acute nature of the pandemic and the dearth of high-level evidence.
NA,Routine infection control practices augmented by airborne precautions are paramount when treating the COVID-19-positive patient.
NA,Best practices for PPE use in patients who have unknown COVID-19 status are a highly charged and emotional issue.
NA,The variables to be considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources.
NA,This article also explores the concerns of surgeons regarding possible transmission to their own family members as a result of caring for COVID-19 patients.
NA,The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and poses an unparalleled obstacle in the sixty-five year history of organ transplantation.
NA,Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity.
NA,The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality.
NA,Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates.
NA,Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity.
NA,Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services.
NA,In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure.
NA,Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant programs.
NA,We performed a narrative review to explore the economics of daily operating room management decisions for ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery.
NA,Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment).
NA,The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons.
NA,Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia.
NA,Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms.
NA,Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs.
NA,Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h).
NA,For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done.
NA,Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases.
NA,When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case.
NA,Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times.
NA,Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned.
NA,In conclusion, this review shows that while COVID-19 is prevalent, it will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties.
NA,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has affected more than 1 270 000 people worldwide.
NA,The numbers of reported cases continue to rise and threaten global health.
NA,Transmissions among family members are frequently observed, although the route of transmission is partially known.
NA,Here we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within one family.
NA,Sequencing of the S gene of the viral genome showed 100% identity among samples, suggesting that the same strain caused the infection.
NA,Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings.
NA,Our observations suggest the importance of preventing family transmission and the efficacy of current integrated treatment for mild/moderate pneumonia in COVID-19 cases.
NA,Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19 thereby increasing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 like other procedures such as tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
NA,Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients and patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Recommendations for sleep clinics and sleep laboratory activities are also discussed as well as the emergency use of PAP devices as a substitute for ventilation.
NA,We identified seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness.
NA,Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets.
NA,Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals.
NA,BackgroundEstimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies.AimWe estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19.
NA,We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased.MethodsWe used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network.
NA,From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.ResultsThe mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.78-6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01-4.91) for Tianjin.
NA,The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32-67) for Singapore and 62% (95% CrI: 50-76) for Tianjin.
NA,Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution.
NA,Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a significant challenge to global healthcare.
NA,Acute stroke care requires rapid bedside attendance, imaging, and intervention.
NA,However, for acute stroke patients who have a diagnosis of or are under investigation for COVID-19, the concern for nosocomial transmission moderates operational procedures for acute stroke care.
NA,We present our experience with an in-hospital stroke code called on a COVID-19-positive patient with a left middle cerebral artery syndrome and the challenges faced for timely examination, imaging, and decision to intervene.
NA,The outlook for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of protocols to sustain timely and effective acute stroke care while mitigating healthcare-associated transmission.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already evolved into a rapidly expanding pandemic.
NA,Risk factors for COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are all strongly associated with smoking habits.
NA,The effects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed.
NA,Emerging data indicate that smoking history is the major determinant of worsening COVID-19 outcomes.
NA,Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function.
NA,Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as a public health measure to limit the global impact of COVID-19.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, outpacing the capacity and resources of health systems worldwide.
NA,A therapeutic vaccine is not yet on the rise, and preventive measures are the current approach to restraint the transmission of cases.
NA,As the virus is highly contagious via respiratory route (droplets from infected persons, widely spread by coughing or sneezing) and via contact with contaminated surfaces, community transmission and spread can be decreased through the practice of regular and diligent hand hygiene.
NA,Frequent hand washing implies a prolonged exposure to water and other chemical or physical agents and may induce several pathophysiologic changes, such as epidermal barrier disruption, impairment of keratinocytes, the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of the skin immune system, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.
NA,Adverse dermatologic effects, such as excessive skin dryness or even contact dermatitis (particularly the irritant subtype and, to a lesser extent, the allergic subtype), can occur, especially in individuals with a history of atopic dermatitis.
NA,These skin conditions are perfectly manageable, and applying a moisturizer immediately after washing hands or after using a portable hand sanitizer is the cornerstone in preventing the development of eczematous changes in the hands.
NA,In the current global context, the potential occurrence of these dermatological adverse events should in no way cause people to deviate from strict hand hygiene rules.
NA,Five cases of non-remitting conjunctivitis turned out to be the sole presenting sign and symptom of COVID-19.
NA,These patients tested positive on RT-PCR of naso-pharyngeal swabs and developed no fever, malaise, or respiratory symptoms throughout the course of their illness.
NA,They all fully recovered.
NA,In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained.
NA,Ocular involvement and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should never be overlooked.
NA,In fact, conjunctival mucosae are susceptible to respiratory viruses and remain an important point of entry.
NA,For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,During the extensive outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea, many strategies in the hospital setting, such as stratified patient care, the assignment of hospitals/beds by a task force team, and the establishment of dedicated COVID-19 hospitals, dedicated COVID-19 emergency centers, COVID-19 community facilities, and respiratory care split hospitals, were adopted to mitigate community transmission and prevent nosocomial infection.
NA,Most of these strategies were used during the Middle East Respiratory syndrome outbreak and were applied again successfully during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The reallocation of health care capacity, repurposing of hospitals, and close collaboration between the government and the health care committee might have been the key to successfully addressing the crisis of COVID-19 given the shortage of health care resources.
NA,COVID-19 pandemic can cause irreparable damage to the involved society.
NA,This study aimed to provide a summary of the up-to-dated clinical display, diagnostics, molecular and genetic implications for COVID-19 infected patients.
NA,In this review, 73 research articles published before 25 March 2020 were analyzed to better understand the clinical characteristics of patients and to introduce the available serological, hematology and molecular diagnostic methods.
NA,Apart from articles extracted from PubMed and Google Scholar, WHO (https://www.who.int/), NHC (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/) were also accessed to search for eligible studies.
NA,Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms &quot;2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test&quot; were used.
NA,As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
NA,We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
NA,All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
NA,Sustained spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has happened in major US cities.
NA,Capacity needs in cities in China could inform the planning of local health care resources.
NA,To describe and compare the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2 cities in China to estimate the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if an outbreak equivalent to that in Wuhan occurs.
NA,This comparative effectiveness study analyzed the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China, from January 10 to February 29, 2020.
NA,Timing of disease control measures relative to timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread.
NA,Number of critical and severe patient-days and peak number of patients with critical and severe illness during the study period.
NA,In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented 6 weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Between January 10 and February 29, 2020, patients with COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 429 (25-1143) patients in the ICU and 1521 (111-7202) inpatients with serious illness each day.
NA,During the epidemic peak, 19 425 patients (24.5 per 10 000 adults) were hospitalized, 9689 (12.2 per 10 000 adults) were considered in serious condition, and 2087 (2.6 per 10 000 adults) needed critical care per day.
NA,In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within 1 week of case importation.
NA,Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day.
NA,During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness.
NA,The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10 000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence.
NA,Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 illness continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month.
NA,Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local health care systems in US cities.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019, SARS-COV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and an increased stress on hospital resources, which has resulted in a spike in the anxiety of the frontline healthcare workers.
NA,News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing.
NA,We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed.
NA,In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19.
NA,When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE.
NA,However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different.
NA,In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure.
NA,We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols.
NA,A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist.
NA,At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-2019 initiated at Wuhan, China has become a global threat by rapid transmission and severe fatalities.
NA,Recent studies have uncovered whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-2019).
NA,In addition, lung metagenomic studies on infected patients revealed overrepresented Prevotella spp. producing certain proteins in abundance.
NA,We performed host-pathogen protein-protein interaction analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and overrepresented Prevotella proteins with human proteome.
NA,We also performed functional overrepresentation analysis of interacting proteins to understand their role in COVID-2019 severity.
NA,It was found that over-expressed Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection.
NA,As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins are involved in multiple interactions with NF-kB, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019.
NA,Prevotella may have role in COVID-2019 outbreak and should be given importance for understanding disease mechanisms and improving treatment outcomes.
NA,Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed patients and healthcare givers alike and challenged our practice of antenatal care, including fetal diagnosis and therapy.
NA,This document aims to review relevant recent information to allow us to optimize prenatal care delivery.
NA,We discuss potential modifications to obstetric management and fetal procedures in SARS-CoV2-negative and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with fetal anomalies or disorders.
NA,Most fetal therapies are time sensitive and cannot be delayed.
NA,If personnel and resources are available, we should continue to offer procedures of proven benefit, acknowledging any fetal and maternal risks, including those to health care workers.
NA,There is, to date, minimal, unconfirmed evidence of spontaneous vertical transmission, though it may theoretically be increased with some procedures.
NA,Knowing a mother's preoperative SARS-CoV-2 status would enable us to avoid or defer certain procedures while she is contagious and to protect health care workers appropriately.
NA,Some fetal conditions may alternatively be managed neonatally.
NA,Counseling regarding fetal interventions which have a possibility of additional intra- or postoperative morbidity must be performed in the context of local resource availability.
NA,Procedures of unproven benefit should not be offered.
NA,We encourage participation in registries and trials that may help us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women, their fetuses, and neonates.
NA,To perform a systematic analysis of articles on the ophthalmological implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,PubMed.gov was searched for relevant articles using the keywords &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, and &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; in conjunction with &quot;ophthalmology&quot; and &quot;eye&quot;.
NA,Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth).
NA,As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified.
NA,Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe.
NA,There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews.
NA,These articles could be classified into the topics &quot;Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission&quot;, &quot;Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19&quot;, &quot;Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;, and &quot;Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure&quot;.
NA,Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth.
NA,Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19.
NA,As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic.
NA,In the eye, COVID-19 can manifest as keratoconjunctivitis.
NA,Ein substanzieller Teil der aktuellen Literatur zur COVID-19-Pandemie beschäftigt sich mit deren ophthalmologischen Aspekten.
NA,In diesem Übersichtsartikel soll ein Überblick über die bisher publizierten Studien gegeben werden, die für die Ophthalmologie relevant sind.
NA,PubMed.gov wurde systematisch nach Artikeln mit den folgenden Schlüsselwörtern durchsucht: „COVID-19“, „Coronavirus“ und „SARS‐CoV‐2“ in Verbindung mit „Ophthalmology“ und „Eye“.
NA,Darüber hinaus wurde eine Analyse der Empfehlungen der ophthalmologischen Fachgesellschaften durchgeführt, insbesondere der American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) und des Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth).
NA,Es wurden 21 Artikel mit Peer Review zu den ophthalmologischen Aspekten von COVID-19 identifiziert (Stand: 16.
NA,April 2020).
NA,Davon stammten 12 (57,1%) aus Asien, 6 (28,6%) aus den Vereinigten Staaten und 3 (14,3%) aus Europa.
NA,Darunter befanden sich 5 Originalarbeiten (23,8%), 10 (47,6%) Briefe an den Herausgeber, 3 (14,2%) Fallberichte und 3 (14,2%) Übersichtsartikel.
NA,Es erfolgte eine Sortierung in folgende Themen: „(Okuläre) Übertragungswege und Prävention“, „Ophthalmologische Manifestation von COVID-19“, „Klinische Richtlinien für die ophthalmologische Praxis während der COVID-19-Pandemie“ und „Praktische Empfehlungen für den klinischen Alltag“.
NA,Letztere wurden den Empfehlungen der AAO und des RCOphth entnommen.
NA,Eine Vielzahl kürzlich erschienener Artikel befasst sich mit den ophthalmologischen Aspekten von COVID-19.
NA,Da COVID-19 über das Auge übertragen werden kann (aktiv über die Tränenflüssigkeit und passiv über den Ductus nasolacrimalis), ist eine sorgfältige Infektionsprävention in der ophthalmologischen Praxis von großer Bedeutung.
NA,Eine Augenbeteiligung kann sich als Keratokonjunktivitis manifestieren.
NA,Since the report of the first confirmed case in Daegu on February 18, 2020, local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Korea has continued.
NA,In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread.
NA,We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes.
NA,We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method.
NA,The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide.
NA,Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June.
NA,We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in Korea.
NA,Since the outbreak is expected to continue until May, non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be sustained over the long term are required.
NA,Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) present risks to health care workers (HCW) due to airborne transmission of pathogens.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential for HCWs to recognize which procedures are potentially aerosolizing so that appropriate infection prevention precautions can be taken.
NA,The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations.
NA,A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020.
NA,All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review.
NA,Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated.
NA,Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category.
NA,Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs.
NA,Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs.
NA,Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue.
NA,Tracheal procedures like tracheostomy and endotracheal suctioning can also result in airborne transmission via small virus containing aerosols.
NA,COVID-19 can severely affect pregnant women and the issue of vertical transmission of sars-cov-2 has also emerged.
NA,Sars-cov-2 could be recovered by real-time (RT) PCR from nasal and throat swabs, sputum and feces of symptomatic patients including neonates but not from vaginal swabs, amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal blood or breast milk.
NA,Viremia was present in 1% of symptomatic adults.
NA,We identified 12 articles published between February 10<sup>th</sup> and April 4<sup>th</sup> 2020 reporting on 68 deliveries and 71 neonates with maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy.
NA,Perinatal exposure, including mode of delivery and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection are crucial in differentiating congenital from perinatal infection.
NA,Neonatal infection is usually asymptomatic.
NA,Neonatal infection was diagnosed within 48 hours of life in 4 cases.
NA,Detection rates of real-time PCR and the interpretation of IgM and IgG antibodies levels in cord and neonatal blood are discussed in relation with the immaturity of the fetal and neonatal immune system.
NA,Human behaviour is central to transmission of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and changing behaviour is crucial to preventing transmission in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions.
NA,Isolation and social distancing measures, including edicts to stay at home, have been brought into place across the globe to reduce transmission of the virus, but at a huge cost to individuals and society.
NA,In addition to these measures, we urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not touching one's eyes, nose or mouth.
NA,There is an urgent need for direct evidence to inform development of such interventions, but it is possible to make a start by applying behavioural science methods and models.
NA,Background and objectives The rapid and extensive spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major cause of concern for the healthcare profession.
NA,The aim of this study is to assess the awareness of COVID-19 disease and related infection control practices among healthcare professionals and students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.
NA,Materials and methods A total of 1562 responders from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region completed a questionnaire-based survey on the awareness, knowledge, and infection control practices related to COVID-19 infection in the healthcare setting.
NA,The questionnaire was adapted from the current interim guidance and information for healthcare workers published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
NA,Convenient sampling method was used for data collection and the distribution of responses was presented as frequencies and percentages.
NA,Descriptive statistics were performed for all groups and subgroups based on the percentage of correct responses.
NA,Individual pairwise comparisons were done using the median test for the percentage of correct responses.
NA,Results The overall awareness for all subgroups was adequate with 71.2% reporting correct answers.
NA,The highest percentage of correct responses were from undergraduate medical students and the lowest was from non-clinical/administrative staff.
NA,Less than half of the total respondents could correctly define &quot;close contact.&quot; More than three-fourths of the responders were aware of the various infection control measures like rapid triage, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette and having a separate, well ventilated waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients.
NA,However, only 45.4% of the responders were aware of the correct sequence for the application of a mask/respirator, and only 52.5% of the responders were aware of the preferred hand hygiene method for visibly soiled hands.
NA,Conclusion There is a need for regular educational interventions and training programs on infection control practices for COVID-19 across all healthcare professions.
NA,Occupational health and safety are of paramount importance to minimize the risk of transmission to healthcare students and professionals and provide optimal care for patients.
NA,An infection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated from Wuhan city of China in December 2019 converted rapidly into pandemic by March 11, 2020.
NA,To date, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has risen exponentially in more than 200 countries, with an estimated crude mortality ratio of at least over 2%.
NA,The unpreparedness to tackle the unprecedented situation of coronavirus has contributed to the rising number of cases, which has generated an immense sense of fear and anxiety amongst the public.
NA,It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW).
NA,Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW.
NA,Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout.
NA,The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.
NA,An epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and rapidly spread across China and beyond, with human to human transmission.
NA,On February 12, 2020, World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
NA,Most COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using Chinese medicines and other secondary therapies.
NA,As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered.
NA,Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate.
NA,An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.
NA,This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Transmission of viruses from one species to another is not unusual in nature.
NA,Despite this, evolutionarily successful transmissions are rare.
NA,Such events can cause pandemics and are followed by host-virus coevolution procedures that can increase the fitness potential of viruses.
NA,In this perspective article, I recognize eight main types of trans-species viral transmission.
NA,I consider two of them as evolutionarily successful, explaining why coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 could be one of them.
NA,It is impossible to predict or comprehend the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The UK Government's advice for vulnerable people, including older adults, to move towards self-isolation and social distancing is likely to reduce rates of transmission, the risk of severe illness and the impact on the acute health services.
NA,Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people.
NA,It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear.
NA,The biopsychopharmacosocial model provides one method of assessing mental health and planning health and social care needs.
NA,This article hopes to guide community health professionals through the specifics of this assessment model in relation to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The evidence on the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly growing.
NA,Understanding why some patients suffering from COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe.
NA,The answer to this question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic.
NA,Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role.
NA,An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined.
NA,More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
NA,Herewith, presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.
NA,Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.
NA,Before 2020 the term 'social distancing' while not new, was barely known.
NA,The concept was promoted by the World Health Organisation in 2008 as a public health measure to prevent transmission of influenza, and in various forms it can be identified in reference to epidemics going back hundreds of years.
NA,However, in common parlance social distancing is more likely to have been associated with stigma or social class, something with negative connotations, something to be avoided.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already exerted an enormous impact on the entire world.
NA,Everything is overwhelmed in the face of a rapid escalation of cases.
NA,The countries that have already reported the peak of transmission are easing their preventive measures yet fearing a second wave of infection.
NA,If the virus causes that next wave, are we sufficiently prepared to deal with it?
NA,I argue that the stakeholders concerned should simultaneously handle the ongoing pandemic while making effective preparations for its second wave.
NA,To relax the preventive measures, countries must thoroughly revisit their situations based on scientific evidence.
NA,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a global threat.
NA,However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported.
NA,Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded.
NA,The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
NA,The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days.
NA,The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease.
NA,Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment.
NA,The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection.
NA,The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.
NA,CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children.
NA,The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.
NA,The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.
NA,The pandemic novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global concern in which respiratory system is not the only one involved.
NA,Previous researches have presented the common clinical manifestations including respiratory symptoms (i.e., fever and cough), fatigue and myalgia.
NA,However, there is limited evidence for neurological and psychological influences by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,In this review, we discuss the common neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including acute cerebrovascular disease (i.e., cerebral hemorrhage) and muscle ache.
NA,Possible viral transmission to the nervous system may occur via circulation, an upper nasal transcribrial route and/or conjunctival route.
NA,Also, we cannot ignore the psychological influence on the public, medical staff and confirmed patients.
NA,Dealing with public psychological barriers and performing psychological crisis intervention are an important part of public health interventions.
NA,Current studies estimated a general incubation period distribution of COVID-19 based on early-confirmed cases in Wuhan, and have not examined whether the incubation period distribution varies across population segments with different travel histories.
NA,We aimed to examine whether patients infected by community transmission had extended incubation periods than the early generation patients who had direct exposures to Wuhan.
NA,Based on 4741 patient case reports from municipal centers of disease control by February 21, 2020, we calculated the incubation periods of 2555 patients with clear epidemiological survey information and illness development timeline.
NA,All patients were categorized into five groups by their travel histories.
NA,Incubation period distributions were modeled for each group by the method of the posterior Weibull distribution estimation.
NA,Adults aged 30 to 59 years had the most substantial proportion of confirmed cases in China.
NA,The incubation period distribution varied slightly across patient groups with different travel histories.
NA,Patients who regularly lived in Wuhan and left to other locations before January 23, 2020 had the shortest posterior median value of 7.57 days for the incubation period, while the incubation periods for persons affected by local community transmission had the largest posterior median of incubation periods, 9.31 days.
NA,The median incubation period for all patients infected outside Wuhan was 9 days, a bit of more extended than the early estimated 5-day incubation period that was based on patients in Wuhan.
NA,Our findings may imply the decreases of virulence of the COVID-19 virus along with intergenerational transmission.
NA,Congregate work and residential locations are at increased risk for infectious disease transmission including respiratory illness outbreaks.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets.
NA,Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1).
NA,Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths.
NA,Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized.
NA,During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC.
NA,Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported.
NA,Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.
NA,* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance.
NA,Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers.
NA,Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
NA,Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered.
NA,Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3).
NA,Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).
NA,From January 21 through February 23, 2020, a total of 14 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were diagnosed in six U.S. states, including 12 cases in travelers arriving from China and two in household contacts of persons with confirmed infections.
NA,An additional 39 cases were identified in persons repatriated from affected areas outside the United States (1).
NA,Starting in late February, reports of cases with no recent travel to affected areas or links to known cases signaled the initiation of pandemic spread in the United States (2).
NA,By mid-March, transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had accelerated, with rapidly increasing case counts indicating established transmission in the United States.
NA,Ongoing traveler importation of SARS-CoV-2, attendance at professional and social events, introduction into facilities or settings prone to amplification, and challenges in virus detection all contributed to rapid acceleration of transmission during March.
NA,Public health responses included intensive efforts to detect cases and trace contacts, and implementation of multiple community mitigation strategies.
NA,Because most of the population remains susceptible to infection, recognition of factors associated with amplified spread during the early acceleration period will help inform future decisions as locations in the United States scale back some components of mitigation and strengthen systems to detect a potential transmission resurgence.
NA,U.S. circulation of SARS-CoV-2 continues, and sustained efforts will be needed to prevent future spread within the United States.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic that is causing thousands of deaths worldwide.
NA,The virus can be transmitted from person to person, directly or indirectly, via the respiratory, oro-fecal and probably sexual routes.<sup>1</sup> The eventual vertical transmission route is still poorly explored.
NA,However, mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the placenta probably does not occur, or likely occurs very rarely.<sup>2</sup> All the studies conducted on COVID-19 pregnant women involved patients undergoing cesarean section, but the indications for such delivery modality were not clearly stated.
NA,While the outbreak has reached every region of the world, it is undeniable that countries in the southern hemisphere seem to be less affected, where cases have been reported, these have been imported and travel related.
NA,We analyzed the climate temperature from various regions according to their current ongoing human-to-human transmission status.
NA,We studied 3 groups; Group 1, 10 provinces from China with majority of COVID-19 cases; Group 2, areas where continuous horizontal transmission outside of China had been reported; and group 3, areas where imported cases had been detected and no horizontal transmission had been documented after at least seven days since the first case was reported.
NA,The regions without ongoing human-to-human transmission showed significantly higher temperatures when compared to China and countries with ongoing human-to-human transmission, with over an 11-degree difference.
NA,The average rainfall during the study period was significantly higher in those regions without OHHT when compared to the Chinese provinces with ongoing human-to-human transmission and the regions with active transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Our findings show statistically significant differences between regions with ongoing human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 cases compared to those regions without horizontal transmission.
NA,This phenomenon could have implications in the behavior of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the following months.
NA,This article aims at collecting all information needed for dentists regarding the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world by reviewing articles published by now.
NA,In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, China.
NA,There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly evolving into transmission from human to human.
NA,The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients' saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19.
NA,There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
NA,Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life.
NA,As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.
NA,Although people of all ages are susceptible to the novel coronavirus infection, which is presently named &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19), there has been relatively few cases reported among children.
NA,Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults.
NA,We report one pediatric case of COVID-19.
NA,A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a symptom of fever, and was diagnosed with a mild form of COVID-19.
NA,The child's mother and grandmother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,However, the lymphocyte counts were normal.
NA,The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura and resorption after the treatment.
NA,The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms.
NA,The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild.
NA,Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease.
NA,The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms.
NA,This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.
NA,Patients with COVID-19 may present with respiratory syndromes indistinguishable from those caused by common viruses.
NA,Early isolation and containment is challenging.
NA,Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed.
NA,Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a &quot;respiratory surveillance ward&quot; (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done.
NA,Patients could be transferred when SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative on 2 consecutive occasions, 24 hours apart.
NA,Over the study period, 1,178 patients were admitted to the RSWs.
NA,The mean length-of-stay (LOS) was 1.89 days (SD, 1.23).
NA,Among confirmed cases of pneumonia admitted to the RSW, 5 of 310 patients (1.61%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This finding was comparable to the pickup rate from our isolation ward.
NA,In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE.
NA,In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure.
NA,No patient-HCW transmission was detected despite intensive surveillance.
NA,Our institution successfully utilized the strategy of an RSW over a 6-week period to contain a cluster of COVID-19 cases and to prevent patient-HCW transmission.
NA,However, this method was resource-intensive in terms of testing and bed capacity.
NA,After the initial outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (now called COVID-19)-in Wuhan, China-and its subsequent fast dispersion throughout the world, many questions regarding its pathogenesis, genetic evolution, prevention, and transmission routes remain unanswered but fast explored.
NA,More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention measures.
NA,Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic.
NA,Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult.
NA,Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreaks.
NA,Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare.
NA,Thus, preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the lessons we have learnt so far.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pathology, declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, which can have negative consequences for pregnant women and their newborns.
NA,The aim of this study was to explore the available knowledge on the consequences of developing COVI-19 in pregnant women and their neonates.
NA,Scoping Review, in which the search for articles was conducted using DeCS (&quot;pregnancy&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;health&quot;) and MeSH (&quot;pregnan*&quot;, &quot;pregnant women&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;), linking the terms with the Boolean AND operator.
NA,Databases used were Web of Science, Scopus, BVS, Scielo and CUIDEN.
NA,In addition, the PRISMA methodology was applied.
NA,Ten studies were identified that assessed maternal and neonatal health after maternal COVID-19 infection.
NA,Pregnant women seem to had no serious symptoms.
NA,Neonates appeared to be affected to a greater extent.
NA,A death was reported in a premature newborn whose mother had COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,There did not appear to be vertical transmission from mother to child.
NA,Nevertheless, this information was not conclusive.
NA,COVID-19 appears to be more benign with pregnant women than with their neonates.
NA,La enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) es una nueva patología, declarada emergencia de salud pública por la Organización Mundial de la Salud, que puede tener consecuencias negativas en las embarazadas y sus recién nacidos.
NA,El objetivo fue explorar el conocimiento disponible sobre las consecuencias de desarrollar COVID-19 en las embarazadas y en los recién nacidos durante el embarazo.
NA,Se realizó una Scoping Review, en la que se usó la búsqueda de artículos en los directorios DeCS (“embarazo”, “coronavirus”, “salud”) y MeSH (“pregnan*”, “pregnant women”, “coronavirus”), uniendo los términos con el operador booleano AND.
NA,Se buscó en las bases de datos Web of Science, Scopus, BVS, Scielo y CUIDEN.
NA,Además, se aplicó la metodología PRISMA.
NA,Se identificaron 10 estudios en los que se evalúo la salud materna y neonatal tras infección materna por COVID-19.
NA,Las embarazadas parecían no presentar síntomas graves.
NA,Los neonatos se veían afectados en mayor medida.
NA,Se informó de un fallecimiento de un recién nacido prematuro cuya madre tuvo neumonía por COVID-19.
NA,No pareció haber transmisión vertical de madre a hijo, aunque esta información no era concluyente.
NA,El COVID-19 parece ser más benigno con las embarazadas que con sus recién nacidos.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 2020<sup>1-4</sup>.
NA,Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies<sup>5</sup>.
NA,Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term.
NA,We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests<sup>6,7</sup> to identify and deploy recovered individuals<sup>8</sup> as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale.
NA,The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services<sup>9</sup> while reducing the probability of transmission.
NA,Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.
NA,The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence<sup>10,11</sup> and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies<sup>12-15</sup>.
NA,As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted mainly through droplets, sneezes and aerosols, there is a high risk of transmission during dental procedures.
NA,This report describes measures that can be adopted by oral healthcare personnel to minimize the risk of cross-contamination in clinical practice during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,Dado que el SARS-CoV-2, causante de síndrome respiratorio agudo severo, se transmite principalmente por medio de gotitas, estornudos y aerosoles, existe un alto riesgo de transmisión durante los procedimientos dentales.
NA,En este informe se describen las medidas que puede adoptar el personal de salud bucodental para reducir al mínimo el riesgo de contaminación cruzada en la práctica clínica durante la actual pandemia por SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Como o SARS-CoV-2, que causa síndrome respiratória aguda grave, é transmitido principalmente por gotículas, espirros e aerossóis, há um alto risco de transmissão durante os procedimentos odontológicos.
NA,Este relatório descreve os passos que podem ser tomados pelo pessoal de saúde oral para minimizar o risco de contaminação cruzada na prática clínica durante a actual pandemia do SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The majority of cases infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China centered in the city of Wuhan.
NA,Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures.
NA,This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan.
NA,We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR<sup>+Q</sup>).
NA,The SEIR<sup>+Q</sup> dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan.
NA,Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020.
NA,The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions.
NA,By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count.
NA,Effective reproductive number <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward.
NA,In conclusion, the proposed SEIR<sup>+Q</sup> dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.
NA,The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.
NA,The current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reveals a peculiar trend of milder disease and lower case fatality in children compared to adults.
NA,Consistent epidemiologic evidence of reduced severity of infection in children across different populations and countries suggests there are underlying biologic differences between children and adults that mediate differential disease pathogenesis.
NA,This presents a unique opportunity to learn about disease modifying host factors from pediatric populations.
NA,Our review summarizes the current knowledge of pediatric clinical disease, role in transmission, risks for severe disease, protective immunity, as well as novel therapies and vaccine trials for children.
NA,We then define key hypotheses and areas for future research that can use the pediatric model of disease, transmission, and immunity to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for people of all age groups.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection.
NA,We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19.
NA,We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days.
NA,We will recruit 1,500 patients each for the PEP and PET trials.
NA,Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive five days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo.
NA,The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19.
NA,The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death).
NA,Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States.
NA,These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic.
NA,In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.
NA,Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04308668); registered 16 March, 2020.
NA,On 31 March 2020, Chinese Health Authorization announced that numbers of asymptomatic cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will be made to the public daily.
NA,This was a very important step since different counties have different capacities for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and control strategy for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak.
NA,We summarized the characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and the transmission potential of asymptomatic cases.
NA,Then we provided guidelines for the management of asymptomatic cases through quarantine and nucleic acid/serology tests.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty regarding the safety and appropriate utilization of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) during this current outbreak.
NA,Surgical governing bodies such as Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and the Royal Colleges of Surgery of Great Britain and Ireland have made statements regarding the possibility of COVID-19 release into CO2 insufflant during MIS.
NA,The basis for this concern is prior evidence in the literature of other viral pathogen release during laparoscopic surgery.
NA,The recommendations are correctly based on caution given the lack of understanding of how COVID-19 compares to other viruses with regard to transmission and presence in CO2 during MIS.
NA,In this review we have investigated the available literature on COVID-19 transmission during MIS, address the implications of current and previously published recommendations and discuss steps to mitigate COVID-19 transmission during MIS for staff and patient safety.
NA,Tracheostomy procedures have a high risk of aerosol generation.
NA,Airway providers have reflected on ways to mitigate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission risks when approaching a surgical airway.
NA,To standardize institutional safety measures with tracheostomy, we advocate using a dedicated tracheostomy time-out applicable to all patients including those suspected of having COVID-19.
NA,The aim of the tracheostomy time-out is to reduce preventable errors that may increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We prospectively assessed 49 coronavirus disease cases in Guangdong, China, to estimate the frequency and duration of detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in human body fluids.
NA,The prolonged persistence of virus RNA in various body fluids may guide the clinical diagnosis and prevention of onward virus transmission.
NA,We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission in a previously unaffected country.
NA,We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions.
NA,We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing.
NA,We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases.
NA,We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation.
NA,We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval.
NA,Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction.
NA,The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days).
NA,In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days.
NA,Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.
NA,In light of the Covid-19 pandemic in New Zealand, physical safety and infection control are now the priorities for acute inpatient units.
NA,Across the board, the milieu of wards has altered, with seeking to preserve bed spaces admission criteria has become stricter and patients are being fast tracked out of inpatient care with less time to transition back into the community.
NA,In order to restrict opportunities for transmission of Covid 19 between patients and the public, wards which previously were unlocked during the day are now locked at all times without use of mental health legislation.
NA,Leave from wards has become more difficult to acquire and visitors are not allowed to come into hospitals.
NA,COVID-19 has become a global pandemic with a dramatic impact on healthcare systems.
NA,Concern for viral transmission necessitates the investigation of otologic procedures that use high-speed drilling instruments, including mastoidectomy, which we hypothesized to be an aerosol generating procedure.
NA,Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill was simulated using fresh-frozen cadaveric heads with fluorescein solution injected into the mastoid air cells.
NA,Specimens were drilled for one-minute durations in test conditions with and without a microscope.
NA,A barrier drape was fashioned from a commercially available drape (the OtoTent).
NA,Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60 cm in radius.
NA,Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site.
NA,Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate.
NA,Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30 cm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, p = 0.0066).
NA,Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment.
NA,A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.
NA,The COVID-19 global pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented health care crisis.
NA,To reduce risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission in the Radiology Department, this article describes measures to increase the preparedness of Radiology Department, such as careful screening of staff and patients, thorough disinfection of equipments and rooms, appropriate use of personal protection equipment, and early isolation of patients with incidentally detected computed tomography findings suspicious for COVID-19.
NA,The familiarity of radiologists with clinical and imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia and their prognostic implications is essential to provide optimal care to patients.
NA,It is unclear whether seasonal changes, school closures or other public health interventions will result in a slowdown of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,We aimed to determine whether epidemic growth is globally associated with climate or public health interventions intended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,We performed a prospective cohort study of all 144 geopolitical areas worldwide (375 609 cases) with at least 10 COVID-19 cases and local transmission by Mar. 20, 2020, excluding China, South Korea, Iran and Italy.
NA,Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020).
NA,In univariate analyses, there were few or no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99).
NA,Strong associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings (RRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79), school closures (RRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78) and measures of social distancing (RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85).
NA,In a multivariable model, there was a strong association with the number of implemented public health interventions (<i>p</i> for trend = 0.001), whereas the association with absolute humidity was no longer significant.
NA,Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with latitude and temperature, but may be associated weakly with relative or absolute humidity.
NA,Conversely, public health interventions were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth.
NA,Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is widely associated with disease and mortality, and there is no reason to think this will not be the case for the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has reached a pandemic level.
NA,Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19.
NA,SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general.
NA,We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning.
NA,However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation.
NA,Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19.
NA,From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease.
NA,This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected.
NA,As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations.
NA,A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.
NA,COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that has turned into a pandemic.
NA,It spreads through droplet transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,It is an RNA virus displaying a spike protein as the major surface protein with significant sequence similarity to SARS-CoV which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.
NA,The receptor binding domain of the spike protein interacts with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and is considered as the antigenic determinant for stimulating an immune response.
NA,While multiple candidate vaccines are currently under different stages of development, there are no known therapeutic interventions at the moment.
NA,This review describes the key genetic features that are being considered for generating vaccine candidates by employing innovative technologies.
NA,It also highlights the global efforts being undertaken to deliver vaccines for COVID-19 through unprecedented international cooperation and future challenges post development.
NA,During any epidemic of infectious diseases, pregnant women constitute an extremely sensitive group due to altered physiology and immune functions, and thus altered susceptibility to infection.
NA,With regard to the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients, in addition to the treatment of the infection itself, which is not that different from generally accepted principles, it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child.
NA,Questions arise concerning the continuation of pregnancy, how to terminate the pregnancy, the possibility of virus transmission through the placenta, isolation of the newborn after birth, and breastfeeding.
NA,The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in pregnant women.
NA,Because the epidemic began in China, most of the available literature comes from studies conducted there.
NA,The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women.
NA,They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences.
NA,Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences.
NA,This will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.
NA,COVID-19 greatly affected millions and affected the way we practice with heightened posture in the way we treat surgical patients.
NA,Surgical consensus guidelines are recommending caution in the use of laparoscopy for the theoretical possibility of viral transmission from aerosolization of tissue and peritoneal fluid during surgery.
NA,However, there has yet to be proof of COVID-19 being present in peritoneal fluid, justifying the consensus statements.
NA,We aim to assess the presence of COVID-19 in peritoneal fluid.
NA,We performed a laparoscopic appendicectomy for a COVID-19-infected patient with acute appendicitis.
NA,Peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings were collected and sent for COVID-19 PCR.
NA,The peritoneal fluid sample collected on entry and at the end of the operation was negative for COVID-19 on PCR.
NA,The patient had an uneventful recovery from surgery.
NA,This case revealed that COVID-19 was not detected in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings in a patient infected with COVID-19.
NA,This study provides novel preliminary data in the investigation of COVID-19 transmission from laparoscopy-related aerosolization.
NA,When treating migraine patients in the current era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), many institutions have moved away from face-to-face procedures like onabotulinumtoxinA injections,<sup>1</sup> sometimes transitioning to the newer CGRP antibodies for migraine prevention.
NA,However, despite our best efforts to mitigate viral transmission, many of our migraine patients may eventually be exposed to SARS-CoV2.
NA,While most patients will have mild to moderate symptoms, a subset will become severely ill, with possible complications including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,Given the possibility of this level of severe respiratory illness, we should consider what effect blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) might have on these patients.
NA,We have read with great interest the articles regarding cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.
NA,Studies showed 20.4% of COVID-19 patients developed cutaneous manifestations and might be the only presenting symptom.(
NA,1) To date, previous cases reported urticaria as one of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19.(
NA,2)(1)(3)(4) This atypical symptom might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and virus transmission, especially in countries where cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported widely such as in Indonesia.
NA,We would like to report a case of urticaria in COVID-19-positive non-ICU hospitalized patient from Indonesia to bring awareness to its cutaneous manifestations.
NA,COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, has spread throughout the world.
NA,Because of exponential growth, social distancing is a critical strategy to decrease transmission Thus, educational medical communities from many countries have transitioned to online didactics<sup>1</sup> .
NA,Recommendations to cancel all non-urgent visits have been proposed<sup>2</sup> .
NA,Our dermatology department has canceled all elective outpatient visits and surgeries.
NA,Consequently, trainees' surgical skills have been severely affected.
NA,To continue our educational program, we have implemented measures to help our trainees continue learning and maintaining surgical skills.
NA,Postoperative fever is common following orthopedic trauma surgery.
NA,As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively.
NA,The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission.
NA,This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively.
NA,One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations.
NA,Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.
NA,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March.
NA,To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut.
NA,Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state.
NA,By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions.
NA,Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions.
NA,This study provides evidence of widespread sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is disproportionately impacting older individuals and healthcare workers.
NA,Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads.
NA,This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018.
NA,A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state.
NA,In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S.
NA,ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%).
NA,The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana.
NA,The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan.
NA,Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.
NA,Sanitary Emergency Measures (SEM) were implemented in Mexico on March 30th, 2020 requiring the suspension of non-essential activities.
NA,This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020.
NA,The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate.
NA,Using a modification of the Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities.
NA,Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to achieve an effective social distancing.
NA,This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence.
NA,We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19.
NA,Our model is fitted to the available data.
NA,The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used to estimate the contact rates, infectious periods and mortality rate using both confirmed cases (by date of symptoms initiation), and daily mortality.
NA,Data on deaths after March 23rd, 2020 is used to estimate the mortality rate after the mitigation measures are implemented.
NA,Our simulations indicate that the most likely dates for maximum incidence are between late May and early June, 2020 under a scenario of high SEM compliance and low SEM abandonment rate.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-like coronavirus of likely zoonotic origin first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.
NA,The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date.
NA,This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design.
NA,We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time.
NA,Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host.
NA,Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity.
NA,We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity.
NA,By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
NA,Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (&gt;15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host.
NA,We additionally provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
NA,The novel human coronavirus disease COVID-19 has become the fifth documented pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic.
NA,COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread worldwide.
NA,The coronavirus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses based on phylogenetic analysis.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a spillover of an animal coronavirus and later adapted the ability of human-to-human transmission.
NA,Because the virus is highly contagious, it rapidly spreads and continuously evolves in the human population.
NA,In this review article, we discuss the basic properties, potential origin, and evolution of the novel human coronavirus.
NA,These factors may be critical for studies of pathogenicity, antiviral designs, and vaccine development against the virus.
NA,The novel coronavirus Covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses.
NA,Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury.
NA,Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups.
NA,Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.
NA,Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against Covid-19.
NA,The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (&quot;Spanish flu&quot; 1918, &quot;Asian flu&quot; 1956 and &quot;the Hong Kong flu&quot; 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines.
NA,The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4 + memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response.
NA,According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
NA,The CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting &quot;lung crash&quot; until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged.
NA,Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection.
NA,In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur.
NA,Intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as physical or sexual violence, emotional abuse and stalking.
NA,It is typically experienced by women but can also be experienced by men.
NA,During quarantine due to the COVID-19, home risks to become a very dangerous place for victims of domestic violence.
NA,Very recent studies focusing on abusive situations during COVID emergence were identified in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase.
NA,During the COVID-19 outbreak people have encountered an invisible and dark enemy and an experience of impotence.
NA,Due to the feelings of frustration and agitation, aggression arises with possible transgenerational transmission of trauma and violence.
NA,Especially during quarantine and COVID emergence around the world there is a need of programs aimed to prevent acts of domestic violence and to achieve accurate assessment of multiple domains of abuse (psychological, physical, sexual) provided by trained multidisciplinary staffs (including psychiatrists, psychologists, social and legal services).
NA,In many countries around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in health services being diverted to manage patients with the condition.
NA,There are situations however that still require the undertaking of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) with potentially high exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission through droplet, contact and possibly airborne routes.
NA,The objective of this paper is to explore a structured way for the operative team to approach AGP to reduce aerosolisation of secretions, decrease open airway time and minimise staff exposure.
NA,The authors (otolaryngologists, anaesthetists and nursing staff) created a unified operative team checklist based on collation of national and international specialty society statements, local state government recommendations, hospital policies and literature review.
NA,Simulation was undertaken and the checklist was refined after performing AGP on patients with unknown (presumed positive) COVID-19 status.
NA,An 8 step operative team checklist is provided describing details for the immediate pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative journey of the patient to encourage healthcare workers to reflect upon and modify usual practice during AGP to mitigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes or retrieval of an inhaled airway foreign body is used to illustrate the steps however the checklist structure is modifiable for other AGP and adaptable for local needs.
NA,At a time of overwhelming and changing information and recommendations, an operative team checklist may provide some structure to healthcare workers undertaking AGP to reduce anxiety, maintain focus, prompt consideration of alternatives and potentially reduce risk.
NA,This study aimed to analyze how meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity and rainfall can affect the spread of COVID-19 in five Brazilian (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Manaus and Fortaleza) cities.
NA,The cities selected were those with the largest number of confirmed cases considering data of April 13.
NA,Variables such as number of cumulative cases, new daily cases and contamination rate were employed for this study.
NA,Our results showed that higher mean temperatures and average relative humidity favored the COVID-19 transmission, differently from reports from coldest countries or periods of time under cool temperatures.
NA,Thus, considering the results obtained, intersectoral policies and actions are necessary, mainly in cities where the contamination rate is increasing rapidly.
NA,Thus, prevention and protection measures should be adopted in these cities aiming to reduce transmission and the possible collapse of the health system.
NA,Although not widely studied, behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented.
NA,Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (R<sub>o</sub>) of the pathogen.
NA,The most notable example is rabies.
NA,When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression.
NA,The virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated.
NA,Toxoplasmosis is another example.
NA,When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten.
NA,Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive.
NA,Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen.
NA,Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission.
NA,Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a havoc situation across the globe that modern society has ever seen.
NA,Despite of their paramount importance, the transmission routes of SARS-Cov-2 still remain debated among various sectors.
NA,Evidences compiled here strongly suggest that the COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately ventilated environments.
NA,Existing experimental data showed that coronavirus survival was negatively impacted by ozone, high temperature and low humidity.
NA,Here, regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing ambient ozone concentration level from 48.83 to 94.67 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (p-value = 0.039) and decreasing relative humidity from 23.33 to 82.67% (p-value = 0.002) and temperature from -13.17 to 19 °C) (p-value = 0.003) observed for Chinese cities during Jan-March 2020.
NA,Besides using these environmental implications, social distancing and wearing a mask are strongly encouraged to maximize the fight against the COVID-19 airborne transmission.
NA,At no other time than now are the scientists in various disciplines around the world badly needed by the society to collectively confront this disastrous pandemic.
NA,The current research initiative focuses on the role of Pakistani media in eliminating panic and depression among health practitioners and the general public due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,In Pakistan, electronic media is the most common source of information due to the higher rural population and the lower literacy rate and media's handling of COVID-19 coverage so far creates panic and depression.
NA,We suggest that special televised transmissions featuring psychologists and physiatrists should be aired to reduce the panic.
NA,Media also mitigates the stress of frontline medical staff by paying special attributes to them.
NA,There is an increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contributing to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,At this point, the need for further disease characterization is critical.
NA,COVID-19 is well established as a respiratory tract pathogen; however, recent studies have shown an increasing number of patients reporting gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
NA,The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is often delayed compared to that of respiratory symptoms.
NA,It has been noted that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in fecal matter for an extended period of time, even after respiratory samples have tested negative and patients are asymptomatic.
NA,In this article, SARS-CoV-2 and its disease COVID-19 will be reviewed with consideration of the latest literature about gastrointestinal symptomatology, the mechanisms by which the virus may inflict damage, and the possibility of viral replication contributing to a fecal-oral route of transmission.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has swept the globe with more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 184 countries and territories.
NA,According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two crucial actions can reduce the risk of person-to-person viral transmission: frequent hand washing and surface decontamination with specific environmental protection agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants.
NA,As hygiene recommendations evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic and community members adopt changing practices, dermatologists are likely to see a rise in adverse cutaneous reactions from prolonged irritant exposures and widespread use of antimicrobials.
NA,The purposes of this report are to familiarize dermatologists with the hygiene practices recommended for COVID-19 prevention, to highlight adverse cutaneous reactions associated with repeated exposures to detergents and disinfectants, and to discuss strategies which patients can implement during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize skin irritation white still performing hygiene practices effectively.
NA,The first person-to-person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia.
NA,Hospitals have been forced to reorganized their units in response to prepare for an unforeseen healthcare emergency.
NA,In this context, our laboratory (Molecular and Genomic Diagnostics Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS) re-modulated its priorities by temporarily interrupting most of the molecular tests guaranteeing only those considered &quot;urgent&quot; and not postponable.
NA,In particular, this paper details changes regarding the execution of germline BRCA (gBRCA) testing in our laboratory.
NA,A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing (about 60%) compared to the first 2 months of the current year was registered, but the requests have not been reset.
NA,The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists.
NA,These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) into clinical oncology.
NA,Finally, a re-organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit, mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests was necessary, ensuring, however, a high-quality standard and reliability, mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus in cluster epidemics in Guangzhou and provide evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> All the individuals identified to be infected with 2019-nCoV in Guangzhou, including confirmed cases and asymptomatic cases, were included and classified as imported cases and local cases.

NA,There were 68 clusters involving 217 2019-nCoV infection cases (210 confirmed cases and 7 asymptomatic cases).
NA,The median number of subsequent infections caused by an index case in a cluster epidemic was 3, among which 2 were confirmed cases and 1 was asymptomatic cases, respectively.
NA,The average number of contagiousness was 2.18 in shorted incubation period of 1-3 days (The average number of infected cases were 2.18 cases by the index case in a cluster epidemic), the average infection number in family members was 1.86, and the infection ratio of family member transmission was 85.32% (1.86/2.18).
NA,The secondary attack rate in close contacts with shortest incubation period of 1-3 days was 17.12%-18.99%, the secondary attack rate in family members was 46.11%-49.56%. <b>Conclusions:</b> The cluster epidemic of COVID-19 in Guangzhou mainly occurred in families, the contagiousness was high.
NA,It is necessary to strengthen the prevention and control to reduce the community transmission of COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 基于广州市新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）聚集性疫情，分析新型冠状病毒的传染力和续发率，为COVID-19疫情防控的策略提供参考依据。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 对广州市COVID-19（确诊病例和无症状感染者）区分输入病例和本地病例，选择聚集性疫情首发病例为指示病例，以最短潜伏期1～3 d分别评估传染力和续发率。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 截至2020年2月18日，广州市共报告新型冠状病毒感染病例349例，其中，确诊病例339例（占97.13%），无症状感染者10例（占2.87%）。

NA,最短潜伏期1～3 d的传染力平均值为2.18（即每起聚集性疫情中每个病例平均传染2.18人），家庭成员传染力平均值为1.86，家庭成员传染力比例为85.32%（1.86/2.18）。
NA,最短潜伏期为1～3 d的全部密切接触者续发率为17.12%～18.99%，其中，家庭成员续发率为46.11%～49.56%。
NA,<b>结论：</b> 广州市COVID-19聚集性疫情以家庭聚集性为主，传染力强，加强防控措施可有效控制社区传播。.
NA,<b>Objective:</b> COVID-19 outbreak is still under global pandemic.
NA,China is facing the risks of importation and local rebound of COVID-19.
NA,Under the circumstances, preparations for medical resources are in urgently needed. <b>Methods:</b> Based on current understanding of the disease, we set up five scenarios and use the infectious disease transmission dynamic and pandemic theoretical static models to evaluate the demand for medical resources. <b>Results:</b> Different epidemic strength and strategies of disease control and prevention resulted in different levels of medical resource request, and active control strategy and effective measures could significantly decrease the requirement.
NA,During the epidemic rising phase, the cost of prevention and control measures and the requirement of professional response capacities would increase with potential high risk of medical resource demand sharply increasing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Regions with different economic level, population scale, and different prevention and control capabilities should all initiate scientific assessment of medical resource requirement under emergency response and prepare for possible future rebound and epidemic. <b>目的：</b> 新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情仍处于全球大流行阶段，我国面临着境外输入和境内反弹的双重风险，迫切需要开展医疗资源的准备工作。
NA,<b>方法：</b> 本研究基于对疾病的现有认识，假设5种局部地区发生疫情的情景，分别使用传染病传播动力学模型和大流行理论静态模型进行医疗资源需求评估。
NA,<b>结果：</b> 不同流行强度和防控策略的情景下医疗资源需求差别较大，积极防控策略和有效措施能够显著降低医疗资源需求。
NA,疫情快速上升期，防控策略的成本及专业应对能力要求迅速增加，医疗资源需求激增的风险大。
NA,<b>结论：</b> 不同经济发展水平、人口规模和防控能力的地区，均应尽快开展应急状态下医疗资源需求评估，提前为可能出现的疫情反弹和暴发做好医疗资源准备。.
NA,A total of 245 cases of COVID-19 in Shaanxi Province reported in the China information system for disease control and prevention as of February 24, 2020 were selected as the research objects, the cases are divided into imported cases (116 cases, 47.3%) and local cases (129 cases, 52.7%), their basic characteristics, time distribution, transmission mode, intergenerational interval and latent period transmission are analyzed.
NA,The age of local cases [(51.74±15.67) years old], female patients (69 cases, 53.5%), housework and retired staff (40 cases, 31.0%), and patients isolated at the time of onset (50 cases, 38.8%) were higher than imported cases, respectively[(40.66±15.41) years old, (45 cases, 38.8%), (21 cases, 18.1%), (17 cases, 14.6%)] (<i>P</i> values were &lt; 0.05); The infection rate was 0.8% (31/3 666) in close contacts with local cases, which was lower than imported cases 2.0% (69/3 435) (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001); The main source of infection in local cases was relatives (70 cases, 54.3%), and the main way of infection was living together and party (90 cases, 69.8%); the proportion of latent period transmission in our province was 15.5% (20 cases), and the interval between the second-generation case and the source of infection was about 4 days, and the interval between generations was about 6 days.
NA,In summary, the main way of infection of local cases in Shaanxi Province was living together and party, there were a certain proportion of latent period transmission cases at present, it's suggested that the investigation of close contacts should be started 4 days or earlier before the onset of the case.
NA,选取截至2020年2月24日中国疾病预防控制信息系统中上报的所有陕西省新型冠状病毒肺炎病例为研究对象，共245例，将其分为输入型（116例，47.3%）和本地型（129例，52.7%）病例，分析其基本特征、时间分布、传播方式、代际间隔及潜伏期传播等。

NA,综上，陕西省本地型病例感染的主要途径为与传染源共同生活和聚会/聚餐，目前存在一定比例的潜伏期传播病例，建议密切接触者的排查应从病例发病前4 d或更早时间开始。.
NA,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, weak health systems must not become a vehicle for transmission through poor infection prevention and control practices.
NA,We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic.
NA,This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith-based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions.
NA,We observed provider-patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management.
NA,We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models.
NA,Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants).
NA,Compliance was 6·9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74·8% for glove use (n=4915), 4·8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43·3% for waste management (n=4299).
NA,Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains.
NA,Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management.
NA,For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5·80 [95% CI 3·91-8·61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2·65 [1·67-4·20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers.
NA,For glove use, nurses and midwives (10·06 [6·68-15·13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5·93 [4·05-8·71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category.
NA,Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11·95 [8·98-15·89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0·27 [0·17-0·43]) and waste management (0·25 [0·14-0·44] than the reference category.
NA,Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene.
NA,Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings.
NA,Improvements in provision of supplies and health worker behaviours are urgently needed in the face of the current pandemic.

NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly worldwide.
NA,We present a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in a baby with non-productive cough and normal chest computed tomography, in whom only anal swabs tested positive by real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,She was given atomization inhalation therapy with recombinant human interferon alfa-1b for 10 days.
NA,Her anal swabs remained positive for eight days, whereas her throat swabs were persistently negative by real-time PCR testing.
NA,Mild and asymptomatic cases, especially in children, might present with PCR negative pharyngeal/nasal swabs and PCR positive anal swabs.
NA,Those patients are potential sources of infection via fecal-oral transmission for COVID-19.
NA,Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were firstly appeared in China.
NA,They have certain similarities in biological, epidemiological and pathological.
NA,To data, the researches have shown that their gene exhibit 79% of identical sequence and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar.
NA,There have been extensive research performed on SARS, however, the understanding of pathophysiology impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) is still limited.
NA,In the review, we draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis for further understand the features of COVID-19.
NA,By comparing these two diseases, we found, COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, higher morbidity and mortality.
NA,Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases were emerged in COVID-19.
NA,Children started with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe condition and newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications.
NA,The laboratory test data showed, the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, otherwise the number of CD4+ and CD8+T cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases.
NA,Based on these early observations, as pediatrician, we put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and give some recommendations to contain the disease.
NA,The main route of transmission of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and presumably also of the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2, is via droplets and close contacts, however their fecal elimination also suggests the possible spread via water.
NA,A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water.
NA,Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water.
NA,In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments.
NA,Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids.
NA,Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution.
NA,HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods.
NA,The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.
NA,Incarcerated people are at disproportionately high risk of contracting COVID-19.
NA,Prisons are epicenters for COVID-19 transmission, including to the community.
NA,High rates of preexisting health conditions, limited access to quality health care, and inability to social distance make it impossible to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in prisons.
NA,Due to a history of compounded social determinants, incarcerated populations are disproportionately composed of people of color and people with stigmatized behavioral health disorders.
NA,Rapid decarceration is needed to promote health equity.
NA,Historical mass decarceration events demonstrate feasibility to rapidly release large groups of people while maintaining public safety.
NA,Iran and Ireland have released substantial portions of their prison populations by transitioning people to home confinement.
NA,In the United States and Uganda, some jurisdictions have reduced new incarcerations through policies that decrease arrests.
NA,These policies must be globally expanded to contain the epidemic, and its potential health consequences, while addressing health equity.
NA,On March 11 <sup> <i>th</i> </sup> 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 novel corona virus as global pandemic.
NA,Corona virus, also known as COVID-19 was first originated in Wuhan, Hubei province in China around December 2019 and spread out all over the world within few weeks.
NA,Based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins university and Canadian health authority, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models.
NA,In this novel research, we evaluated the key features to predict the trends and possible stopping time of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Canada and around the world.
NA,In this paper we presented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a deep learning approach to forecast the future COVID-19 cases.
NA,Based on the results of our Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we predicted the possible ending point of this outbreak will be around June 2020.
NA,In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA.
NA,Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 <sup> <i>th</i> </sup> day predictions for 2 successive days.
NA,Our forecasts in this paper is based on the available data until March 31, 2020.
NA,To the best of our knowledge, this of the few studies to use LSTM networks to forecast the infectious diseases.
NA,The major purpose of the presented study is to analyze and find the solution for the model of nonlinear fractional differential equations (FDEs) describing the deadly and most parlous virus so-called coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,The mathematical model depending of fourteen nonlinear FDEs is presented and the corresponding numerical results are studied by applying the fractional Adams Bashforth (AB) method.
NA,Moreover, a recently introduced fractional nonlocal operator known as Atangana-Baleanu (AB) is applied in order to realize more effectively.
NA,For the current results, the fixed point theorems of Krasnoselskii and Banach are hired to present the existence, uniqueness as well as stability of the model.
NA,For numerical simulations, the behavior of the approximate solution is presented in terms of graphs through various fractional orders.
NA,Finally, a brief discussion on conclusion about the simulation is given to describe how the transmission dynamics of infection take place in society.
NA,We study in this work a discrete mathematical model that describes the dynamics of transmission of the Corona virus between humans on the one hand and animals on the other hand in a region or in different regions.
NA,Also, we propose an optimal strategy to implement the optimal campaigns through the use of awareness campaigns in region j that aims at protecting individuals from being infected by the virus, security campaigns and health measures to prevent the movement of individuals from one region to another, encouraging the individuals to join quarantine centers and the disposal of infected animals.
NA,The aim is to maximize the number of individuals subjected to quarantine and trying to reduce the number of the infected individuals and the infected animals.
NA,Pontryagin's maximum principle in discrete time is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method.
NA,The numerical simulation is carried out using Matlab.
NA,The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was calculated to investigate the cost-effectiveness of all possible combinations of the four control measures.
NA,Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we show that control of protecting susceptible individuals, preventing their contact with the infected individuals and encouraging the exposed individuals to join quarantine centers provides the most cost-effective strategy to control the disease.
NA,Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has garnered global attention due to its rapid transmission, which has infected more than two million people worldwide.
NA,Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the crucial interventions to control virus spread and dissemination.
NA,Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals.
NA,However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results.
NA,As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments.
NA,This review aims to provide a concise yet extensive collation of current immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2, while discussing the strengths, limitations and applications of antibody detection in SARS-CoV-2 research and control.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has been treated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.
NA,This work made an early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China based on a simple mathematical model and limited epidemiological data.
NA,Combing characteristics of the historical epidemic, we found part of the released data is unreasonable.
NA,Through ruling out the unreasonable data, the model predictions exhibit that the number of the cumulative 2019-nCoV cases may reach 76,000 to 230,000, with a peak of the unrecovered infectives (22,000-74,000) occurring in late February to early March.
NA,After that, the infected cases will rapidly monotonically decrease until early May to late June, when the 2019-nCoV outbreak will fade out.
NA,Strong anti-epidemic measures may reduce the cumulative infected cases by 40%-49%.
NA,The improvement of medical care can also lead to about one-half transmission decrease and effectively shorten the duration of the 2019-nCoV.
NA,December 2019 saw a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China quickly spread globally.
NA,Currently, COVID-19, defined as the new pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), has reached over 750,000 confirmed cases worldwide.
NA,The virus began to spread in Italy from the 22nd February, and the number of related cases is still increasing.
NA,Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for National Healthcare System's capacity.
NA,WHO underlines the importance of specific disease regional estimates.
NA,Because of this, Italy aimed to put in place proportioned and controlled measures, and to guarantee adequate funding to both increase the number of ICU beds and increase production of personal protective equipment.
NA,Our aim is to investigate the current COVID-19 epidemiological context in Sardinia region (Italy) and to estimate the transmission parameters using a stochastic model to establish the number of infected, recovered, and deceased people expected.
NA,Based on available data from official Italian and regional sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the period between 2nd and 15th March 2020.
NA,To better reflect the actual spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst scenarios.
NA,We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Sardinia.
NA,Our analysis can help health authorities and policymakers to address the right interventions to deal with the rapidly expanding health emergency.
NA,The outbreak of the current 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a worldwide health threat.
NA,Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required.
NA,Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed.
NA,Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information.
NA,In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures.
NA,The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail.
NA,Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low.
NA,This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract.
NA,However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection.
NA,Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.
NA,The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 but later spread to other parts of the world.
NA,The disease as at the point of writing this paper has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,The application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence, big data, and similar methodologies are potential tools to predict the extent of the spread and effectiveness of containment strategies to stem the transmission of this disease.
NA,In societies with constrained data infrastructures, modeling and forecasting COVID-19 becomes an extremely difficult endeavor.
NA,Nonetheless, we propose an online forecasting mechanism that streams data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to update the parameters of an ensemble model which in turn provides updated COVID-19 forecasts every 24 hours.
NA,The ensemble combines an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Prophet - an additive regression model developed by Facebook, and a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model combined with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH).
NA,The outcomes of these efforts are expected to provide academic thrust in guiding the policymakers in the deployment of containment strategies and/or assessment of containment interventions in stemming the spread of the disease in Nigeria.
NA,Since the first reports of the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease (COVID-19), concerns remain about whether the virus is transmissible in pregnant women from the mother to the fetus during either the antepartum period or the process of labor and delivery.
NA,One recent review reported that in a small number of cases, two PCR swabs of the placenta were sent in additional to neonatal and cord blood testing, and both placental PCR swabs were negative.<sup>1</sup> Other studies have demonstrated the finding of SARS-CoV2 IgM in neonates born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy,<sup>2,3</sup> findings that may indicate vertical transmission of the virus in utero.
NA,We report our experience with placental/membrane SARS-CoV2 RNA PCR swab results after delivery to a series of symptomatic mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy.
NA,IRB approval was obtained.
NA,All pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who gave birth between March 1, 2020 and April 20, 2020 at NYU Langone Health were identified by a search of the electronic medical record.
NA,Charts were reviewed for documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing sent from either the placenta or membranes within 30 minutes following delivery.
NA,PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 was performed using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress assay.
NA,Placental swabs were obtained from the amniotic surface after clearing the surface of maternal blood (placental PCR).
NA,Membrane swabs were obtained from between the amnion and chorion after manual separation of the membranes (membrane PCR).
NA,Maternal COVID-19 illness was categorized as mild, severe, or critical.<sup>4</sup> The time interval from maternal diagnosis of COVID-19 to delivery was calculated in days.
NA,Infants were tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR between days of life 1 and 5 while hospitalized.
NA,Hospitalized infants were also assessed for clinical signs and symptoms, including fever, cough, and nasal congestion.
NA,Of 32 COVID-19 positive pregnant patients who gave birth in this timeframe, placental or membrane swabs were sent from 11 patients (Table).
NA,Three of 11 swabs were positive.
NA,None of the infants tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on days of life 1 through 5, and none demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 infection.
NA,Of 11 placental or membrane swabs sent following delivery, 3 swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, all in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness at time of delivery.
NA,This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in placental or membrane samples.
NA,While there were no clinical signs of vertical transmission, our findings raise the possibility of intrapartum viral exposure.
NA,Given the mixing of maternal and fetal fluid and tissue at time of delivery, the origin of the detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our series is unclear.
NA,It may represent contamination from maternal blood, amniotic fluid, or COVID-19 infection of the membranes and amniotic sac.
NA,For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.<sup>5,6</sup>Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission.
NA,Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive.
NA,In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on healthcare systems around the world with 3.0 million infected and 208,000 resultant mortalities as of this writing.
NA,Information regarding infection in pregnancy is still limited.
NA,To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2.
NA,This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020.
NA,Severe infection was defined according to published criteria by patient reported dyspnea, respiratory rate &gt; 30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;300 and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24 to 48 hours on chest imaging.
NA,Critical disease was defined by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.
NA,Women were excluded if they had presumed COVID-19 infection but laboratory testing was negative.
NA,The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge.
NA,Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery.
NA,The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms.
NA,Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported.
NA,Of 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 44 (69%) had severe and 20 (31%) critical disease.
NA,The following pre-existing comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
NA,Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 ±6 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 ±6 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms.
NA,Eighty-one percent of women were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 9% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir.
NA,All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission.
NA,The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days for severe, 10.5 days for critical, <i>p</i>=0.01).
NA,For those who required it, intubation usually occurred around day 9, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease occurred on day 8.
NA,In women with critical disease, prone positioning was performed in 20% of cases, the rate of ARDS was 70%, and re-intubation was necessary in 20%.
NA,There was one case of maternal cardiac arrest, but no cases of cardiomyopathy and no maternal deaths.
NA,Thirty-two (50%) women in this cohort delivered during their COVID-19 hospitalization (34% of severe and 85% of critical women).
NA,Eighty-eight percent (15/17) of pregnant women with critical COVID-19 who delivered during their disease course were delivered preterm, 94% of them via cesarean; in all, 75% (15/20) of critically ill women delivered preterm.
NA,There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths, or cases of vertical transmission.
NA,In hospitalized pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, admission typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 severe versus 12 critical).
NA,Critically ill women had a high rate of ARDS, and there was one case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy, or maternal mortality.
NA,Hospitalization for severe or critical COVID-19 infection resulted in delivery during the course of infection in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester.
NA,There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.
NA,COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by the widespread transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Some of those infected become seriously ill.
NA,Others do not show any symptoms, but can still contribute to transmission of the virus.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is excreted in the oral cavity and can be spread via aerosols.
NA,Aerosol generating procedures in dental health care can increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
NA,Due to the risk of infection of both dental healthcare workers and patients, additional infection control measures for all patients are strongly recommended when providing dental health care.
NA,Consideration should be given to which infection control measures are necessary when providing care in both the current situation and in the future.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grade B infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,In pace with the spreading of the disease, biosafety risk of the biological specimen preservation in biobanks has been significantly increased and biosafety protection during biological specimen preservation become increasingly important.
NA,According to the related national rules and the corresponding guidelines of Chinese Medical Association, this paper introduced the etiology about SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology about COVID-19, and the biosafety protection principles of individuals and biological specimen storage places in the process of personal protection, protection of collection, transport, handling, preservation, detection, post-detection disposal and emergencies of biological specimen.
NA,Emphasized to carry out a strict biosafety-risk assessment on biological specimen basing on virus load information, infectivity, and sample type (possible contact transmission, aerosol transmission, and fecal oral transmission).
NA,To establish a SEIR epidemic dynamics model that can be used to evaluate the COVID-19 epidemic, and to predict and evaluate the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province using the proposed model.
NA,COVID-19 SEIR transmission dynamics model was established, which took transmission ability in latent period and tracking quarantine interventions into consideration.
NA,Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted.
NA,By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed.
NA,The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province.
NA,Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people.
NA,In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people.
NA,The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.
NA,Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients.
NA,High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques.
NA,To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance.
NA,It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC.
NA,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
NA,Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
NA,Secondly, an initial ow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
NA,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
NA,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
NA,Staff surveillance is crucial during the containment phase of a pandemic to help reduce potential healthcare-associated transmission and sustain good staff morale.
NA,During an outbreak of SARS-COV-2 with community transmission, our institution used an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers (HCWs).
NA,Our strategy comprised 3 key components: (1) enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's staff clinic for monitoring; (2) conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19; and (3) outbreak investigation and management.
NA,Over a 16-week surveillance period, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs with ARI symptoms.
NA,Two of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with intrahospital HCW-HCW transmission; we also detected 1 family cluster and 2 clusters among HCWs who shared accommodation.
NA,No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted.
NA,Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic.
NA,An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs.
NA,With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs.
NA,Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.
NA,In addition to moving people and goods, ships can spread disease.
NA,Vessel trajectory data from ship Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) is available online and can be extracted and analyzed, as we illustrate in the case of the current coronavirus epidemic.
NA,This data should be included in epidemiological models of disease transmission to complement air traffic data and inform operational responses.
NA,Recent EACVI recommendations described the importance of limiting cardiovascular imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to reduce virus transmission, protect healthcare professionals from contamination, and reduce consumption of personal protective equipment.
NA,However, an elevated troponin remains a frequent request for cardiac imaging in COVID-19 patients, partly because it signifies cardiac injury due to a variety of causes and partly because it is known to convey a worse prognosis.
NA,The present paper aims to provide guidance to clinicians regarding the appropriateness of cardiac imaging in the context of troponin elevation and myocardial injury, how best to decipher the mechanism of myocardial injury, and how to guide patient management.
NA,During a meeting in Munich, Germany, a presymptomatic attendee with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected at least 11 of 13 other participants.
NA,Although 5 participants had no or mild symptoms, 6 had typical coronavirus disease, without dyspnea.
NA,Our findings suggest hand shaking and face-to-face contact as possible modes of transmission.
NA,To illustrate the extent of transmission, identify affecting risk factors and estimate epidemiological modeling parameters of SARS-CoV-2 in household setting.
NA,We enrolled 35 confirmed index cases and their 148 household contacts, January 2020-February 2020, in Zhuhai, China.
NA,All participants were interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires.
NA,Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals.
NA,Epidemiological, demographic and clinical data (when available) were collected.
NA,Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate (SIR) in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic.
NA,Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility.
NA,Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI; 3.4 to 5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI; 4.3 to 6.2 days), respectively.
NA,Early isolation of patients with COVID-19 and prioritizing rapid contact investigation, followed by active symptom monitoring and periodic laboratory evaluation, should be initiated immediately after confirming patients to address the underlying determinants driving the continuing pandemic.
NA,Few paediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported and we know little about the epidemiology in children, though more is known about other coronaviruses.
NA,We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures.
NA,We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations.
NA,The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
NA,We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers.
NA,English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included.
NA,Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review.
NA,Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies.
NA,Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection.
NA,Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted.
NA,Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission.
NA,Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.
NA,Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus.
NA,COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans.
NA,Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity were analysed for England.
NA,When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation.
NA,To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources.
NA,These included population density, %age&gt;16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management.
NA,Average case morbidity was calculated.
NA,To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice.
NA,The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working and age&gt;60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence.
NA,The local population comorbidity remains unchanged.
NA,The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median.
NA,Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources.
NA,The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England.
NA,Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world.
NA,This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, which first appeared in China in late 2019, and reached pandemic distribution in early 2020.
NA,The first major outbreak in Europe occurred in Northern Italy where it spread to neighboring countries, notably to Austria, where skiing resorts served as a main transmission hub.
NA,Soon, the Austrian government introduced strict measures to curb the spread of the virus.
NA,Using publicly available data, we assessed the efficiency of the governmental measures.
NA,We assumed an average incubation period of one week and an average duration of infectivity of 10 days.
NA,One week after the introduction of strict measures, the increase in daily new cases was reversed, and the reproduction number dropped.
NA,The crude estimates tended to overestimate the reproduction rate in the early phase.
NA,Publicly available data provide a first estimate about the effectiveness of public health measures.
NA,However, more data are needed for an unbiased assessment.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread over 210 countries and territories beyond China shortly.
NA,On February 29, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) denoted it in a high-risk category, and on March 11, 2020, this virus was designated pandemic, after its declaration being a Public Health International Emergency on January 30, 2020.
NA,World over high efforts are being made to counter and contain this virus.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak once again proves the potential of the animal-human interface to act as the primary source of emerging zoonotic diseases.
NA,Even though the circumstantial evidence suggests the possibility of an initial zoonotic emergence, it is too early to confirm the role of intermediate hosts such as snakes, pangolins, turtles, and other wild animals in the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to bats, the natural hosts of multiple coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
NA,The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited to retort this virus.
NA,Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies.
NA,Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This review discusses in brief about the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the role of animals, the veterinary and associated zoonotic links along with prevention and control strategies based on One-health approaches.
NA,Adequate personal protective equipment is needed to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.
NA,Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies.
NA,The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.
NA,Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75-7.54).
NA,No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.
NA,Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.
NA,The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.
NA,Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.
NA,A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.
NA,Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.
NA,Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.
NA,Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.
NA,Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.
NA,Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.
NA,Many healthcare workers were infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early in the epidemic posing a big challenge for epidemic control.
NA,Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers.
NA,This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study.
NA,We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020.
NA,All participants completed a validated questionnaire.
NA,Electronic consent was obtained from all participants.
NA,Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.
NA,Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%).
NA,Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment.
NA,Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively.
NA,Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves).
NA,The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
NA,After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
NA,Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.
NA,The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
NA,Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
NA,J Krishnamurti, a renowned philosopher, describes fear as the transition from the convictions of the Known to the flux of the Unknown1.
NA,The weakening of the interspecies transmission barrier between the animal and human interface has strengthened this fear.
NA,Consequently, our impulsive selves have taken precedence over our reflective voices.
NA,Children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than adults and often have a milder course of illness and a lower case fatality rate.
NA,Children account for an estimated 1% to 5% of those diagnosed with COVID-19.<sup>1</sup> Even so, pre-school-aged children, infants, and children with underlying health conditions may still be at risk for severe disease and complications.<sup>2</sup> Unique aspects of COVID-19 presentation and course in children and possible vertical transmission to newborns from COVID-19-positive mothers are discussed.
NA,Corona virus diseases-2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease identified in late December, 2019, in Wuhan city of China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
NA,Most countries including India have announced some sort of lockdown to reduce the effects of COVID-19 and discontinue the transmission of novel coronavirus.
NA,Major negative effects on the social and surrounding environment have been reported due to COVID-19, however positive effects have also been observed with respect to air quality.
NA,Secondary results have been taken from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), indicating significant reduction (50%) in air quality of Indian region.
NA,This perspective highlights the effects of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on aerosol optical thickness specifically in India.
NA,A new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading worldwide and causes pneumonia, respiratory distress, thromboembolic events, and death.
NA,Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, monitoring disease progression, determination of disease severity, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy.
NA,Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic.
NA,Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provide close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease.
NA,Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Herein we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion.
NA,This study models local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus in China between January 19 and February 29, 2020.
NA,We examine the role of various socioeconomic mediating factors, including public health measures that encourage social distancing in local communities.
NA,Weather characteristics 2 weeks prior are used as instrumental variables for causal inference.
NA,Stringent quarantines, city lockdowns, and local public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the virus transmission rate.
NA,The virus spread was contained by the middle of February.
NA,Population outflow from the outbreak source region posed a higher risk to the destination regions than other factors, including geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.
NA,We quantify the effects of different public health measures in reducing the number of infections through counterfactual analyses.
NA,Over 1.4 million infections and 56,000 deaths may have been avoided as a result of the national and provincial public health measures imposed in late January in China.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique global health challenge further complicating surgical management of COVID-19 positive patients due to a lack of published literature.
NA,Within we discuss a 48-year-old Chinese man, presenting with acute gastrointestinal obstruction due to sigmoid colonic mass.
NA,The patient was screened and tested positive for COVID 19 due to his employment in Wuhan, China at the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter.
NA,The patient was subsequently taken for open sigmoid colonic resection, however the case presented multiple challenges due to the patient's COVID-19 positive status.
NA,The challenges of surgical management of COVID-19 positive patients exist are four-fold.
NA,First the unknown efficacy of pre-surgical risk stratification in COVID-19 positive patients, second the risk of aerosolized COVID-19 transmission during intubation for surgery, third the risk of fecal COVID-19 transmission to surgical staff during large bowel resection, and fourth the post-operative challenges of caring for COVID-19 positive patients.
NA,Further research is needed into these topics, as well as the medical management of COVID-19 surgical patients.
NA,The &quot;novel&quot; coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated &quot;COVID-19&quot;) is the third coronavirus outbreak emerging during the past two decades.
NA,This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
NA,Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the &quot;wrong virus&quot; at the &quot;wrong time&quot;).
NA,These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination.
NA,Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.
NA,Everybody should be inexcusably aware that this is not a drill, and that the consequences of inadequate action will be tragedy.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic continues, with the number of infections and deaths increasing.
NA,The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative.
NA,Until now, there has been no reports concerning the nervous system onset.
NA,We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.
NA,Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone.
NA,There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion.
NA,The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed.
NA,At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment.
NA,After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.
NA,We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic affecting healthcare centers across the globe.
NA,Patients with cancer have been reported to be particularly vulnerable to infection, morbidity, and severe events.
NA,Given the high proportion of asymptomatic carriers and concerns regarding speed and availability of laboratory testing, novel detection strategies are necessary to supplement traditional screening methods and facilitate mitigation of viral transmission.
NA,Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
NA,Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
NA,This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.
NA,We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) breaking out in late December 2019 is gradually being controlled in China, but it is still spreading rapidly in many other countries and regions worldwide.
NA,It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic.
NA,In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction.
NA,First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend.
NA,Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction.
NA,The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic.
NA,Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak poses continued struggles due to the unprecedented number of patients admitted to intensive care units and the overwhelming need for mechanical ventilation.
NA,We report a preliminary case series of 32 patients with COVID-19 who underwent elective tracheostomies after a mean intubation period of 15 days (range, 9-21 days).
NA,The procedure was performed with percutaneous (10 cases) and open (22 cases) surgical techniques.
NA,Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed.
NA,Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed.
NA,The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.
NA,This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.
NA,In early 2020, over 80,000 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were confirmed in China.
NA,Public prevention and control measures, along with efforts from all sectors of society, were undertaken to control and eliminate disease transmission.
NA,This paper describes Chinese citizens' response to the epidemic, the preventive measures they implemented to avoid being infected, and the public strategies that were carried out by the government, health workers, etc.
NA,We also discuss the efficacy of these measures in controlling the epidemic in China.
NA,Information on the responses and behaviors of Chinese citizens were collected through a cross-sectional, internet-based survey using Dingxiang Doctor's public account on WeChat.
NA,Information on public strategies implemented by all sectors of society to control the epidemic and data on new COVID-19 cases were collected from the internet, mainly from government websites.
NA,Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data.
NA,A total of 10,304 participants responded to the survey, with 10,198 valid responses; 74.1% (n=7557) were female and 25.9% (n=2641) were male.
NA,Overall, 98.2% (n=10,013) of participants paid high or very high attention to the epidemic, with WeChat being their main information source (n=9400, 92.2%).
NA,Over half the participants (n=5878, 57.7%) were confident that the epidemic could be curbed in China; 92.4% (n=9427) opened windows for ventilation more frequently than usual; 97.9% (n=9986) used masks in public; 95.7% (n=9759) avoided large crowds and stayed at home as much as possible; and 97.9% (n=9988) washed their hands more often than usual.
NA,Women were more likely to practice these behaviors than men (P&lt;.001).
NA,With a series of strict public control measures, like nationwide health education campaigns, holiday extensions, the Examine and Approve Policy on the resumption of work, close management of working and living quarters, a health QR (Quick Response) code system, community screening, and social distancing policies, the number of new cases have decreased dramatically since February 12, 2020.
NA,The methods employed by Chinese citizens and authorities have effectively curtailed the spread of COVID-19, demonstrating that this pandemic can be brought under control as long as the right measures are taken.
NA,To provide a comprehensive summary of the implications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on orthodontic treatment, contingency management, and provision of emergency orthodontic treatment, using currently available data and literature.
NA,Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations.
NA,Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority.
NA,Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken.
NA,Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes.
NA,The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel.
NA,Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications.
NA,During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities.
NA,Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage.
NA,Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.
NA,Coronaviridae (CoVs) are single stranded RNA viruses. βeta-CoVs encompasses Bat coronavirus (BCoV), the human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus.
NA,In December 2019, a new βeta-CoVs was identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The genome sequencing demonstrated a 79.5% and 96.2% identity to SARS-CoV and a bat CoV genome, respectively, supporting the interspecies transmission and the origin of this new pandemia.
NA,The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has transformed not just healthcare, but also the economic systems on a global scale.
NA,Despite significant efforts to contain the infection, it continues to spread.
NA,Stringent infection control measures have been taken to minimise the transmission between individuals and healthcare workers, especially those undertaking aerosols generating medical procedures.
NA,The uncertainties surrounding infection transmission through breath tests in particular, and to some extent faecal testing, will invariably cause concerns among both the patients and the healthcare workers.
NA,It is therefore pertinent that all of the necessary measures are adopted to minimise this risk of spreading.
NA,In this article, we summarise the physiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the implications for breath testing (in both the clinical and research arena) as well as outlining methods to mitigate these risks.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the manufacturing of novel devices to protect clinicians from the risk of transmission, including the aerosol box for use in intubation.
NA,We evaluated the impact of two aerosol boxes (an early-generation box and a latest-generation box) on intubations in patients with severe COVID-19 with an in-situ simulation crossover study.
NA,The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society COVID-19 airway management guidelines.
NA,The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment.
NA,All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded.
NA,Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations.
NA,Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box ((median (IQR [range])) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6]) seconds vs.
NA,82.1(45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0]) seconds, p=0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4(43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2]) seconds, p=0.008).
NA,No intubations without a box took more than one minute, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over one minute and 4 (17%) took over two minutes (including one failure).
NA,Without an aerosol box, all anaesthetists obtained first-pass success.
NA,With the early-generation and latest-generation boxes, 9 (75%) and 10 (83%) participants obtained first-pass success respectively.
NA,One breach of personal protective equipment occurred using the early-generation box and seven breaches occurred using the latest-generation box.
NA,Aerosol boxes may increase intubation times and therefore expose patients to the risk of hypoxia.
NA,They may cause damage to conventional personal protective equipment and therefore place clinicians at risk of infection.
NA,Further research is required before these devices can be considered safe for clinical use.
NA,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have spread throughout China.
NA,Previous studies predominantly focused on its place of origin, Wuhan, causing over estimation of the disease severity due to selection bias.
NA,We analyzed 465 confirmed cases in Zhejiang province to determine the epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of COVID-19.
NA,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management data from qRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 17, 2020, to January 31, 2020, were collected, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis for independent predictors of severe/critical-type COVID-19 and bioinformatic analysis for features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.
NA,Among 465 COVID-19 patients, median age was 45 years, while hypertension, diabetes, and chronic liver disease were the most common comorbidities.
NA,History of exposure to the epidemic area was present in 170 (36.56%) and 185 (39.78%) patients were clustered in 77 families.
NA,Severe/critical-type of COVID-19 developed in 49 (10.54%) patients.
NA,Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea/vomiting was reported in 58 (12.47%) patients.
NA,Multivariate analysis revealed eight risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19.
NA,Glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 60 (12.90%) and 218(46.88%) patients, respectively.
NA,Bioinformatics showed four single amino acid mutations and one amino acid position loss in SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province, with more similarity to humans than to viruses.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 showed virological mutations and more human transmission in Zhejiang province, indicating considerable epidemiological and clinical changes.
NA,Caution in glucocorticoid and antibiotics use is advisable.
NA,The global anxiety and a significant threat to public health due to the current COVID-19 pandemic reiterate the need for active surveillance for the zoonotic virus diseases of pandemic potential.
NA,Influenza virus due to its wide host range and zoonotic potential poses such a significant threat to public health.
NA,Swine serve as a &quot;mixing vessel&quot; for influenza virus reassortment and evolution which as a result may facilitate the emergence of new strains or subtypes of zoonotic potential.
NA,In this context, the currently available scientific data hold a high significance to unravel influenza virus epidemiology and evolution.
NA,With this objective, the current systematic review summarizes the original research articles and case reports of all the four types of influenza viruses reported in swine populations worldwide.
NA,A total of 281 articles were found eligible through screening of PubMed and Google Scholar databases and hence were included in this systematic review.
NA,The highest number of research articles (<i>n</i> = 107) were reported from Asia, followed by Americas (<i>n</i> = 97), Europe (<i>n</i> = 55), Africa (<i>n</i> = 18), and Australia (<i>n</i> = 4).
NA,The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common influenza A virus subtypes reported in swine in most countries across the globe, however, few strains of influenza B, C, and D viruses were also reported in certain countries.
NA,Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine.
NA,Inter-species transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses.
NA,Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses.
NA,These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global ongoing pandemic.
NA,Timely, accurate and non-invasive SARS-CoV-2 detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, as well as determination of their immune status, will facilitate effective large-scale pandemic control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
NA,Saliva is a biofluid whose anatomical source and location is of particularly strategic relevance to COVID-19 transmission and monitoring.
NA,This review focuses on the role of saliva as both a foe (a common mode of viral transmission via salivary droplets and potentially aerosols) and a friend (as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for viral detection and immune status surveillance) in combating COVID-19.
NA,In the early stages of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, containment of disease importation from epidemic areas was essential for outbreak control.
NA,This study is based on publicly accessible data on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan extracted from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website.
NA,We analysed the characteristics, infection source, symptom presentation, and route of identification of the 321 imported cases that were identified from 21 January to 6 April 2020.
NA,They were mostly returned Taiwanese citizens who had travelled to one or more of 37 countries for tourism, business, work, or study.
NA,Half of these cases developed symptoms before arrival, most of the remainder developed symptoms 1-13 days (mean 4.0 days) after arrival, and 3.4% never developed symptoms.
NA,Three-quarters of the cases had respiratory symptoms, 44.9% had fever, 13.1% lost smell or taste, and 7.2% had diarrhoea.
NA,Body temperature and symptom screening at airports identified 32.7% of the cases.
NA,Of the remainder, 27.7% were identified during home quarantining, 16.2% were identified via contact tracing, and 23.4% were reported by hospitals.
NA,Under the strict enforcement of these measures, the incidence of locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Taiwan remains sporadic.
NA,In conclusion, proactive border control measures are effective for preventing community transmission of this disease.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that impacts the lower respiratory tract.
NA,The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
NA,To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
NA,Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.

NA,The recent pandemic caused by the 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) has affected more than 3.0 million people resulting ~ 212,000 deaths across 215 countries/territories as on 28th April 2020.
NA,The importation of the cases owing to enormous international travels from the affected countries is the foremost reason for local cycle of transmission.
NA,For a country like India, the second most populous country in the world with ~ 1.35 billion population, the management and control of 2019-nCoV domestic spread heavily relied on effective screening and strict quarantine of passengers arriving at various international airports in India from affected countries.
NA,Here, by extracting the data from FLIRT, an online airline database for more than 800 airlines, and scanning more than 180,000 flights and 39.9 million corresponding passenger seats during 4th - 25th March, we show that India experienced the highest risk index of importing the passengers from middle eastern airports.
NA,Contrary to perception, travelers from China imposed lowest risk of importing the infected cases in India.
NA,This is clearly evident form the fact that while the number of infected cases were on the peak in China India was one of the least affected countries.
NA,The number of cases in India started exhibiting a sharp increase in the infected cases only after the European countries and USA recorded large number of infected cases.
NA,We further argue that while the number of cases in middle eastern countries may still be very low, the airports in middle eastern countries, particularly Dubai, being one of the largest transit hubs for international passengers, including arriving in India, might have posed a higher risk of getting infected with 2019-nCoV.
NA,We suggest that any future travel related disease infection screening at the airports should critically assess the passengers from major transit hubs in addition to affected country of origin.
NA,The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is inarguably the most challenging coronavirus outbreak relative to the previous outbreaks involving SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
NA,With the number of COVID-19 cases now exceeding 2 million worldwide, it is apparent that (i) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very high and (ii) there are large variations in disease severity, one component of which may be genetic variability in the response to the virus.
NA,Controlling current rates of infection and combating future waves require a better understanding of the routes of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the underlying genomic susceptibility to this disease.
NA,In this mini-review, we highlight possible genetic determinants of COVID-19 and the contribution of aerosol exposure as a potentially important transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The pandemic due to a novel coronavirus has been sweeping across different regions of the globe since January 2020.
NA,Early reports of this infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consisted of mostly adult patients.
NA,As the outbreak spreads rapidly beyond the epicentre of Wuhan, it becomes clear that infants and children of all ages are susceptible to this infection.
NA,In China, there have been more than 1200 paediatric cases.
NA,Most paediatric patients acquire the infection through household contact with infected adults.
NA,The disease in children is usually self-limiting and most infected children will recover uneventfully within 7-10 days.
NA,Other than symptoms of the respiratory tract, many children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms.
NA,Older children are more likely to have asymptomatic infection.
NA,Although deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 are rarely reported in the paediatric age group, young children and those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe illness.
NA,Only a small fraction of neonates born to infected mother would acquire the virus by vertical transmission.
NA,Because a large proportion of children and adolescents may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection, children are likely to play an important role in community transmission of this infection.
NA,Screening of children who have a definitive contact history will facilitate early diagnosis and isolation of all infected children.
NA,This review summarises the lessons learned in China with regard to the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population.
NA,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe.
NA,In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease.
NA,In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date.
NA,We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.
NA,We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children.
NA,Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members.
NA,The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days.
NA,The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days.
NA,Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza).
NA,Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic.
NA,The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%).
NA,Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue.
NA,Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered.
NA,Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign.
NA,Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally.
NA,Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates.
NA,Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit.
NA,Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.
NA,Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.
NA,Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.
NA,Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.
NA,In late 2019, a novel coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), triggered a global pandemic as the virus spread from the Wuhan Province, China, across all continents.
NA,Although infrequent, severe respiratory infection and death caused by SARS-CoV-2 is disproportionately high amongst healthcare providers such as craniofacial surgeons who work in the head and neck region.
NA,Factors this impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission include: (1) high viral loads in the mucosa of the oral and nasopharynx, (2) limited and/or imprecise disease screening/confirmation testing, (3) access to and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,Coronavirus, the virus that caused the global pandemic at the beginning of 2020 and affected millions across the globe, presented as an enormous challenge to health care providers around the world.
NA,With increasing numbers of infected patients presenting daily, health care workers are struggling to take effective measures to protect themselves from transmission against the highly contagious coronavirus.
NA,This case helps us understand the implications of coronavirus-infected patients on the health care providers directly responsible for the management of these patients and the relative efficacy of different types of respiratory protective equipment mainly N95 masks and surgical masks in preventing the spread of infection among those at the front lines providing care.
NA,<b>Background:</b> Social distancing measures may reduce the spread of emerging respiratory infections however, there is little empirical data on how exposure to crowded places affects risk of acute respiratory infection. <b>Methods:</b> We used a case-crossover design nested in a community cohort to compare self-reported measures of activities during the week before infection onset and baseline periods.
NA,The design eliminates the effect of non-time-varying confounders.
NA,Time-varying confounders were addressed by exclusion of illnesses around the Christmas period and seasonal adjustment.  <b>Results:</b> 626 participants had paired data from the week before 1005 illnesses and the week before baseline.
NA,Each additional day of undertaking the following activities in the prior week was associated with illness onset: Spending more than five minutes in a room with someone (other than a household member) who has a cold (Seasonally adjusted OR 1·15, <i>p</i>=0·003); use of underground trains (1·31, <i>p</i>=0·036); use of supermarkets (1·32, <i>p</i>&lt;0·001); attending a theatre, cinema or concert (1·26, <i>p</i>=0·032); eating out at a café, restaurant or canteen (1·25, <i>p</i>=0·003); and attending parties (1·47, <i>p</i>&lt;0·001).
NA,Undertaking the following activities at least once in the previous week was associated with illness onset: using a bus, (aOR 1.48, p=0.049), shopping at small shops (1.9, p&lt;0.002) attending a place of worship (1.81, p=0.005).    <b>Conclusions:</b> Exposure to potentially crowded places, public transport and to individuals with a cold increases risk of acquiring circulating acute respiratory infections.
NA,This suggests social distancing measures can have an important impact on slowing transmission of emerging respiratory infections.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in Wuhan China has generated substantial morbidity and mortality impact around the world during the last four months.
NA,The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020.
NA,Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country.
NA,We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru.
NA,We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020.
NA,We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place.
NA,Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5).
NA,Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government.
NA,While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease that continues to spread on a global scale.
NA,There has been growing concern about donor-derived transmissions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Herein, we present the case of a patient who underwent ABO-incompatible living donor liver transplantation without knowing that the liver donor was infected with COVID-19 during the donation procedure.
NA,In this case, the donor-derived transmission to the recipient was not identified, and the liver donor was found to be recovering from a COVID-19 infection.
NA,The donor-derived transmission was not identified.
NA,While elective cardiac surgeries have been postponed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and to reduce resource utilization, patients with urgent indications necessitating surgery may still be at risk of contracting the disease throughout their postoperative recovery.
NA,We present a case of an 81-year-old female who underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting and was readmitted following discharge to a nursing facility with a cluster of COVID-19 cases.
NA,Despite symptomatology and imaging concerning for COVID-19, two initial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were negative but a third test was positive.
NA,This case emphasizes the risks of discharge location in the COVID-19 era as well as the importance of clinical suspicion, early isolation practices for those presumed positive, and repeat testing, given the marginal sensitivity of available COVID-19 RT-PCR.
NA,In the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic, multiple organizations have released guidelines stating that all organs from potential deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred, including from otherwise medically eligible donors found to have mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 discovered on routine donor screening.
NA,In this manuscript, we critically examine the available data on the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through organ transplantation.
NA,The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from non-lung clinical specimens, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsy specimens, previous experience with the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the vast experience with other common RNA respiratory viruses are all addressed.
NA,Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart.
NA,Other considerations including ethical, financial, societal, and logistical concerns are also addressed.
NA,We conclude that, for selected patients with high waitlist mortality, transplant programs should consider accepting heart or liver transplants from deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,<b>Background:</b> The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,We state the consolidated and systematic approach for academic medical centres in response to the evolving pandemic outbreaks for sustaining medical education.<b>Discussion:</b> Academic medical centres need to establish a 'COVID-19 response team' in order to make time-sensitive decisions while managing pandemic threats.
NA,Major themes of medical education management include leveraging on remote or decentralised modes of medical education delivery, maintaining the integrity of formative and summative assessments while restructuring patient-contact components, and developing action plans for maintenance of essential activities based on pandemic risk alert levels.
NA,These core principles must be applied seamlessly across the various fraternities of academic centres: undergraduate education, residency training, continuous professional development and research.
NA,Key decisions from the pandemic response teams that help to minimise major disruptions in medical education and to control disease transmissions include: minimising inter-cluster cross contaminations and plans for segregation within and among cohorts; reshuffling academic calendars; postponing or restructuring assessments.<b>Conclusions:</b> While minimising the transmission of the pandemic outbreak within the healthcare establishments is paramount, medical education and research activities cannot come to a standstill each time there is a threat of one.
NA,In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
NA,Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan.
NA,Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help.
NA,This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo.
NA,We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
NA,In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed.
NA,We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection.
NA,The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS.
NA,All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0).
NA,Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom.
NA,Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help.
NA,The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0).
NA,Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital.
NA,Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly.
NA,Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography.
NA,The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital.
NA,Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown.
NA,These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing concern also for the management and outcome of COVID-19-positive pregnant women and their offspring, as reported cases are rare.
NA,Current evidence suggests the association of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy with both severe maternal morbidity requiring intensive care and perinatal complications (preterm birth with consequent neonatal morbidity and even perinatal death).
NA,Most of the reported cases focused specifically on the maternal outcomes and possible vertical transmission, but less attention has been paid to fetus as a patient in such pregnancies.
NA,The use of antenatal steroids and fetal neuroprotection with magnesium sulfate is clearly underreported.
NA,Several recently issued guidelines suggest lowering the upper gestational age for antenatal steroid administration and also advocate extreme caution or even restraining from the use of magnesium sulfate.
NA,Also, the rate of cesarean deliveries among COVID-19 women is unacceptably high.
NA,Here we provide arguments for NOT changing the existing guidelines and caution against cesarean delivery that was the prevalent delivery mode in the reported cases and case series.
NA,Background The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) is quite a challenging experience for the world.
NA,At the moment of birth, the fetus is prepared to face the challenge of labor and the exposure to the outside world, meaning that labor and birth represent the first extrauterine major exposure to a complex microbiota.
NA,The vagina, which is a canal for reproduction, is by evolution separated (but not far) from the anus and urethra.
NA,Passing through the birthing canal is a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of vaginal and gut microorganisms for the vertical transmission of microbiota not only from our mothers and grandmothers but also from earlier ancestors.
NA,Methods Many national and international instructions have been developed since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan in China.
NA,All of them pointed out hygiene measures, social distancing and avoidance of social contacts as the most important epidemiological preventive measures.
NA,Pregnancy and neonatal periods are considered as high risk for Covid-19 infection.
NA,Results The instructions defined the care for pregnant women in the delivery room, during a hospital stay and after discharge.
NA,The controversial procedures in the care of Covid-19-suspected or -positive asymptomatic women in labor were: mode of delivery, companion during birth and labor, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and visits during a hospital stay.
NA,Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm.
NA,A pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening respiratory disease.
NA,Patients with cancer may have compromised immunity due to their malignancy and/or treatment, and may be at elevated risk of severe COVID-19.
NA,Community transmission of COVID-19 could overwhelm health care services, compromising delivery of cancer care.
NA,This interim consensus guidance provides advice for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the pandemic.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic: In patients with cancer with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, consider causes in addition to COVID-19, including other infections and therapy-related pneumonitis.
NA,For suspected or confirmed COVID-19, discuss temporary cessation of cancer therapy with a relevant specialist.
NA,Provide information on COVID-19 for patients and carers.
NA,Adopt measures within cancer centres to reduce risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition; support population-wide social distancing; reduce demand on acute services; ensure adequate staffing; and provide culturally safe care.
NA,Measures should be equitable, transparent and proportionate to the COVID-19 threat.
NA,Consider the risks and benefits of modifying cancer therapies due to COVID-19.
NA,Communicate treatment modifications, and review once health service capacity allows.
NA,Consider potential impacts of COVID-19 on the blood supply and availability of stem cell donors.
NA,Discuss and document goals of care, and involve palliative care services in contingency planning.
NA,This interim consensus guidance provides a framework for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In view of the rapidly changing situation, clinicians must also monitor national, state, local and institutional policies, which will take precedence.

NA,World Health Organization declared on 11 March, COVID 19 as a pandemic infection that has spread rapidly across the globe.
NA,Covid-19 currently has no known treatment or a vaccine.
NA,Oral health professionals are at risk of developing COVID 19 infection as they come into close contact with patients and accompanying relatives who may be carrying the virus.
NA,Since January 2020, and by the end of April this year, more than 150 medical doctors in Italy and over 100 National Health Service workers in the UK have died in the COVID-19 crisis.
NA,While the transmission of COVID 19 via human ex-haled droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is a significant risk particularly for dental practices.
NA,The objective of this brief review is to highlight ways how dental manpower could protect from the spread of disease.
NA,The expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world has alarmed all health professionals.
NA,Especially in dentistry, there is a growing concern due to it's high virulence and routes of transmission through saliva aerosols.
NA,The virus keeps viable on air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours.
NA,In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities).
NA,This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals.
NA,Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment.
NA,The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents.
NA,Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
NA,Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
NA,All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
NA,The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
NA,We conducted the genome sequencing and analysis of the first confirmed COVID-19 infections in Brazil.
NA,Rapid sequencing coupled with phylogenetic analyses in the context of travel history corroborate multiple independent importations from Italy and local spread during the initial stage of COVID-19 transmission in Brazil.
NA,At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China and was identified as the causal pathogen of COVID-19.
NA,The epidemic scale of COVID-19 has increased dramatically, with confirmed cases increasing across China and globally.
NA,Understanding the potential affecting factors involved in COVID-19 transmission will be of great significance in containing the spread of the epidemic.
NA,Environmental and meteorological factors might impact the occurrence of COVID-19, as these have been linked to various diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causative pathogens belong to the same virus family as SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We collected daily data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air quality and meteorological variables of 33 locations in China for the outbreak period of 29 January 2020 to 15 February 2020.
NA,The association between air quality index (AQI) and confirmed cases was estimated through a Poisson regression model, and the effects of temperature and humidity on the AQI-confirmed cases association were analyzed.
NA,The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities.
NA,The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012).
NA,The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 °C ≤ T &lt; 20 °C than in other temperature ranges, while the RR of COVID-19 transmission associated with AQI was higher in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10% ≤ RH &lt; 20%.
NA,Results may suggest an enhanced impact of AQI on the COVID-19 spread under low RH.
NA,The aim of this study is to summarize currently available evidence on vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,A systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Statement.
NA,A total of 22 studies comprising 83 neonates born to mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 were included in the present systematic review.
NA,Among these neonates, three were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 16, 36, and 72 hours after birth, respectively, by nasopharyngeal swab real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; another six had elevated virus-specific antibody levels in serum samples collected after birth, but negative RT-PCR test results.
NA,However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission.
NA,There is currently no direct evidence to support intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Additional RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are needed to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission.
NA,For pregnant women infected during their first and second trimesters, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are needed.
NA,· We review neonates of mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)..
NA,· No direct virologic evidence of vertical transmission has been reported..
NA,· No evidence that cesarean delivery is safer than vaginal delivery..
NA,· More RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are recommended..
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unprecedented in our professional lives and much effort and resources will be devoted to care of patients (and HCW) affected by this illness.
NA,We must also continue to aim for the same standard of care for our non-COVID respiratory patients, while minimizing risks of infection transmission to our colleagues.
NA,This commentary addresses the key paired issues of minimizing performance of diagnostic/staging bronchoscopy in patients with suspected/known lung cancer while maximizing the safety of the procedure with respect to HCW transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Hand hygiene is of utmost importance as it may be contaminated easily from direct contact with airborne microorganism droplets from coughs and sneezes.
NA,Particularly in situations like pandemic outbreak, it is crucial to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus by the practice of proper hand sanitization.
NA,It can be achieved with contact isolation and strict infection control tool like maintaining good hand hygiene in hospital settings and in public.
NA,The success of the hand sanitization solely depends on the use of effective hand disinfecting agents formulated in various types and forms such as antimicrobial soaps, water-based or alcohol-based hand sanitizer, with the latter being widely used in hospital settings.
NA,To date, most of the effective hand sanitizer products are alcohol-based formulations containing 62%-95% of alcohol as it can denature the proteins of microbes and the ability to inactivate viruses.
NA,This systematic review correlated with the data available in Pubmed, and it will investigate the range of available hand sanitizers and their effectiveness as well as the formulation aspects, adverse effects, and recommendations to enhance the formulation efficiency and safety.
NA,Further, this article highlights the efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizer against the coronavirus.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide.
NA,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
NA,The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers.
NA,The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions.
NA,This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe.
NA,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
NA,Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
NA,In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
NA,Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
NA,Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission.
NA,Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second.
NA,In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of 8 to 14 min, which corresponds to droplet nuclei of <i>ca.</i> 4 μm diameter, or 12- to 21-μm droplets prior to dehydration.
NA,These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments.
NA,Gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are frequently observed in COVID-19 patients.
NA,However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the human intestine and contributes to possible fecal-oral transmission.
NA,Here, we report productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2<sup>+</sup> mature enterocytes in human small intestinal enteroids.
NA,Expression of two mucosa-specific serine proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, facilitated SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenic activity and promoted virus entry into host cells.
NA,We also demonstrate that viruses released into the intestinal lumen were inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid, and infectious virus was not recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Our results highlight the intestine as a potential site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, which may contribute to local and systemic illness and overall disease progression.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
NA,Although elective surgical procedures are being cancelled in many parts of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, acute craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma will continue to occur and will need to be appropriately managed.
NA,Surgical procedures involving the nasal, oral, or pharyngeal mucosa carry a high risk of transmission due to aerosolization of the virus which is known to be in high concentration in these areas.
NA,Intraoperative exposure to high viral loads through aerosolization carries a very high risk of transmission, and the severity of the disease contracted in this manner is worse than that transmitted through regular community transmission.
NA,This places surgeons operating in the CMF region at particularly high risk during the pandemic.
NA,There is currently a paucity of information to delineate the best practice for the management of acute CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In particular, a clear protocol describing optimal screening, timing of intervention and choice of personal protective equipment, is needed.
NA,The authors have proposed an algorithm for management of CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that urgent and emergent CMF injuries are addressed appropriately while optimizing the safety of surgeons and other healthcare providers.
NA,The algorithm is based on available evidence at the time of writing.
NA,As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and more evidence and better testing becomes available, the algorithm should be modified accordingly.
NA,: There is a long history of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the surgeon to minimize the transmission of various pathogens.
NA,In the context of the present coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic there is significant controversy as to what forms of PPE are appropriate or adequate.
NA,This review aims to describe the pathogenic mechanism and route of spread of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, as it pertains to accumulated published data from experienced centers globally.
NA,The various forms of PPE that are both available and appropriate are addressed.
NA,There are options in the form of eyewear, gloves, masks, respirators, and gowns.
NA,The logical and practical utilization of these should be data driven and evolve based on both experience and data.
NA,Last, situations specific to surgical populations are addressed.
NA,We aim to provide granular collective data that has thus far been published and that can be used as a reference for optimal PPE choices in the perioperative setting for surgical teams.
NA,As the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as &quot;global pandemic,&quot; it is important for everyone, including nuclear medicine personnel, to know how to stop transmission, contain, and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
NA,We reach out to our ACNM (American College of Nuclear Medicine) international members from Wuhan, China and Singapore, who have participated in dealing with COVID-19 for the last 2 months, to learn from their lessons and experiences, so to provide advice to all ACNM members for their clinical practice and management strategies in responding to COVID-19.
NA,A novel coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-emerged in humans in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since disseminated globally<sup>1,2</sup>.
NA,As of April 16, 2020, the confirmed case count of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had surpassed 2 million.
NA,Based on full-genome sequence analysis, SARS-CoV-2 shows high homology to SARS-related coronaviruses identified in horseshoe bats<sup>1,2</sup>.
NA,Here we show the establishment and characterization of expandable intestinal organoids derived from horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus sinicus species that can recapitulate bat intestinal epithelium.
NA,These bat enteroids are fully susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustain robust viral replication.
NA,Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection<sup>3,4</sup>.
NA,Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19.
NA,Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells.
NA,The robust SARS-CoV-2 replication in human intestinal organoids suggests that the human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population mortality.
NA,Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions.
NA,Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality.
NA,We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease.
NA,In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK-CALIBER).
NA,We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition.
NA,We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1·5, 2·0, and 3·0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0·001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%).
NA,We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation.
NA,We included 3 862 012 individuals (1 957 935 [50·7%] women and 1 904 077 [49·3%] men).
NA,We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13·7% were older than 70 years and 6·3% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4·46% (95% CI 4·41-4·51).
NA,Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions.
NA,In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1·5, four with an RR of 2·0, and seven with an RR of 3·0.
NA,In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 36 749 with an RR of 2·0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3·0.
NA,In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 293 991 with an RR of 2·0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3·0.
NA,We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates.
NA,These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions.
NA,Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has brought major challenges to healthcare systems and public health policies globally, as it requires novel treatment and prevention strategies to adapt for the impact of the pandemic.
NA,Individuals with substance user disorders (SUD) are at risk population for contamination due to multiple factors - attributable to their clinical, psychological and psychosocial conditions.
NA,Moreover, social and economic changes caused by the pandemic, along with the traditional difficulties regarding treatment access and adherence - will certainly worsen during this period, therefore aggravate their condition.
NA,In addition, this population are potential vectors of transmission.
NA,In that sense, specific strategies for prevention and treatment must be discussed. health care professionals dealing with SUD must be aware of the risks and challenges they will meet during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Addiction care must be reinforced, instead of postponed, in order to avoid complications of both SUD and COVID-19 and to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,It emerged as a global pandemic early in 2020, affecting more than 2000 countries and territories.
NA,The infection is highly contagious with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children.
NA,It spreads through person-to-person contact, via aerosol and droplets.
NA,The practice of social distancing - maintaining a distance of 1 - 2 meters or 6 feet -- between people has been widely recommended to slow or halt the spread.
NA,This places orthodontists at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection.
NA,The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during disease crisis.
NA,This should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility.
NA,A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March, 2020 using (CORD-19 2020) dataset<b>,</b> PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics.
NA,This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures.
NA,Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak.
NA,Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required.
NA,Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings.
NA,Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging.
NA,Further studies are required.
NA,The first report of the unusual manifestation of pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan City, China was made on 31 December 2019.
NA,Within one week, the Chinese authorities reported that they had identified the causative agent as a new member of the Coronavirus family, the same family of that was responsible for MERS and SARS not so many years ago.
NA,The new virus was called Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV).
NA,Three weeks later, the World Health Organization declared that 2019-nCoV was capable of direct human-to-human transmission, the virus had spread across several countries in three continents, and had infected close to two thousand people, of whom at least 1 in 5 quite severely.
NA,The number of fatalities was fast rising.
NA,Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov.
NA,It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.
NA,One such potential clinical protocol is proposed as a hypothesis.
NA,The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV,-2 has continued to progress, and increasing information is becoming available about the incidence of digestive symptoms as well as abnormal liver-associated enzymes in patients who are infected.
NA,These are postulated to be related to the virus's use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes.
NA,This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19.
NA,A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints.
NA,The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
NA,Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated.
NA,Currently there is no firm evidence to suggest that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course.
NA,Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases.
NA,Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus.
NA,As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to sweep the world, causing infection of millions and death of hundreds of thousands.
NA,The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID-19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively.
NA,These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs).
NA,Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia.
NA,This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs.
NA,It hopes to provide information for practitioners in the medical field during the epidemic season.
NA,The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
NA,Although person-to-person transmission of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been confirmed, it is not known whether COVID-19 may be transmitted by blood transfusion.
NA,Notwithstanding the urgent requirement of blood, it is critical to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion because many individuals may be asymptomatic carriers and may donate blood.
NA,Several cases in which specific viral RNA could be detected in the serum from patients with COVID-19 have already been reported; these findings suggest that blood donation may be an unexplored route of transmission.
NA,However, the American Association of Blood Banks and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended any specific SARS-CoV-2-related actions to be taken at blood collection centres at this time.
NA,In this report, we describe a case of a 21-year-old man with very severe aplastic anaemia who received apheresis platelet transfusion from an individual who was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,Our patient tested negative for COVID-19 and is awaiting allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide.
NA,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
NA,The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers.
NA,The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions.
NA,This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe.
NA,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
NA,Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
NA,In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
NA,Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
NA,The objective of the study was to assess the knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and relevant universal safety measures among the Nepalese population.
NA,A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese adults from March 29 to April 07, 2020.
NA,A 13- and 15- items structured questionnaire assessed the COVID-19 related knowledge and perception of the universal safety measure.
NA,Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the differences in knowledge between the groups.
NA,Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0 (IBM Corp.
NA,Armonk, NY, USA).
NA,Of the 884 surveys accessed, a total of 871 consented (electronically) and completed the online survey (response rate 98.52%).
NA,The median knowledge score of the participants was 10.0 (± 3.0 IQR).
NA,Although participants' overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission.
NA,Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19.
NA,A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants' age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income.
NA,This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.
NA,Safeguarding the health and promoting the wellbeing and quality of life of the most vulnerable and fragile citizens is a top priority for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).
NA,In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous regulatory policies and 1135 waivers of federal requirements have been implemented by CMS to give long-term care providers and professionals flexibilities to meet to the demands of resident and patient care needs during this public health emergency.
NA,Goals for these policies and waivers include to increase capacity, enhance workforce and capability, improve oversight and transparency, prevent COVID-19 transmission and reduce provider burden.

NA,The ocular surface has been suggested as a site of infection with Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
NA,This review examines the evidence for this hypothesis, and its implications for clinical practice.
NA,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is transmitted by person-to-person contact, via airborne droplets, or through contact with contaminated surfaces.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) to facilitate infection in humans.
NA,This review sets out to evaluate evidence for the ocular surface as a route of infection.
NA,A literature search in this area was conducted on 15 April 2020 using the Scopus database.
NA,In total, 287 results were returned and reviewed.
NA,There is preliminary evidence for ACE2 expression on corneal and conjunctival cells, but most of the other receptors to which coronaviruses bind appear to be found under epithelia of the ocular surface.
NA,Evidence from animal studies is limited, with a single study suggesting viral particles on the eye can travel to the lung, resulting in very mild infection.
NA,Coronavirus infection is rarely associated with conjunctivitis, with occasional cases reported in patients with confirmed COVID-19, along with isolated cases of conjunctivitis as a presenting sign.
NA,Coronaviruses have been rarely isolated from tears or conjunctival swabs.
NA,The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection.
NA,Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect.
NA,Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Necessary precautions to prevent person-to-person transmission should be employed in clinical practice throughout the pandemic, and patients should be reminded to maintain good hygiene practices.
NA,The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected the medical community and stopped the world in its tracks.
NA,This review aims to provide the basic information necessary for us, orthopaedic surgeons to prepare ourselves to face this pandemic together.
NA,Herein, we cover the background of COVID-19, presentation, investigations, transmission, infection control and touch upon emerging treatments.
NA,It is of paramount importance that we should stay vigilant for our patients, our families and ourselves.
NA,Adequate infection control measures are necessary during day-to-day clinical work.
NA,As there is no vaccination and proper medicine for treatment, the recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 has drawn attention to the strategies of quarantine and other governmental measures, like lockdown, media coverage on social isolation, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to control the disease.
NA,The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics.
NA,Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission.
NA,We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number.
NA,Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control.
NA,To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined.
NA,Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.
NA,The current outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly all over the world.
NA,Respiratory droplets and contaction with infected patients are the two major transmission routes.
NA,However, the value of tear virus nucleic acid is still not clear.
NA,We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts.
NA,Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS).
NA,Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets.
NA,Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative.
NA,The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal.
NA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid.
NA,The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T&gt;C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased.
NA,The flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets showed PD-1<sup>+</sup>  CD95<sup>+</sup> cells was accounting for 94.8% in CD3<sup>+</sup>  CD8<sup>+</sup> T subset and for 94.8% in CD3<sup>+</sup>  TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> T subset.
NA,As obstruction of common lacrimal duct, positively detection in one eye for 2 weeks more after nasopharyngeal swab became negative.
NA,More eye swabs should be collected from COVID-19 patients, especially from those immunocompromised, those with eye symptoms and those had a history of ocular diseases.
NA,The Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) is a 2-year training program in applied epidemiology.
NA,FETP graduates have contributed significantly to improvements in surveillance systems, control of infectious diseases, and outbreak investigations in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR).
NA,Knowing their instrumental roles during the COVID-19 crisis, this study aimed to assess the awareness and preparedness of FETP graduates in three EMR countries to respond to COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,An online survey was sent to FETP graduates in 3 countries in the EMR in March 2020.
NA,The FETP graduates were contacted by email and requested to fill an online survey.
NA,Sufficient number of responses were received from three countries only including Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen.
NA,Few responses were received from other countries and therefore they were excluded from the analysis.
NA,The questionnaire comprised a series of questions pertaining to socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19, and preparedness to respond to COVID-19.
NA,This study included a total of 57 FETP graduates (20 from Jordan, 13 from Sudan, and 24 from Yemen).
NA,A total of 31 (54%) graduates had attended training on COVID-19, 29 (51%) are member of a rapid response team against COVID-19 and 54 (95%) had previous experience in response to disease outbreaks or health emergencies.
NA,The vast majority were aware of the main symptoms, mode of transmission, high risk groups, and aware of how to use personal protective equipment.
NA,A total of 46 (81%) respondents considered themselves well prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak and 40 (70%) reported that they currently have a role in supporting the country efforts in the management of COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The FETP graduates in Jordan, Sudan, and Yemen were fully aware of the epidemiology COVID-19 and the safety measures and they are well positioned to investigate and respond to COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Therefore, they should be properly and efficiently utilized by the ministries of health to investigate and respond to the current COVID-19 crisis where the needs are vastly growing and access to outside experts becomes limited.
NA,The threat of introduction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into the United States with the potential for community transmission prompted U.S. federal officials in February 2020 to screen travelers from China, and later Iran, and collect and transmit their demographic and contact information to states for follow-up.
NA,During February 5-March 17, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) received and transmitted contact information for 11,574 international travelers to 51 of 61 local health jurisdictions at a cost of 1,694 hours of CDPH personnel time.
NA,If resources permitted, local health jurisdictions contacted travelers, interviewed them, and oversaw 14 days of quarantine, self-monitoring, or both, based on CDC risk assessment criteria for COVID-19.
NA,Challenges encountered during follow-up included errors in the recording of contact information and variation in the availability of resources in local health jurisdictions to address the substantial workload.
NA,Among COVID-19 patients reported to CDPH, three matched persons previously reported as travelers to CDPH.
NA,Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of COVID-19 into California.
NA,Effectiveness of COVID-19 screening and monitoring in travelers to California was limited by incomplete traveler information received by federal officials and transmitted to states, the number of travelers needing follow-up, and the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.
NA,More efficient methods of collecting and transmitting passenger data, including electronic provision of flight manifests by airlines to federal officials and flexible text-messaging tools, would help local health jurisdictions reach out to all at-risk travelers quickly, thereby facilitating timely testing, case identification, and contact investigations.
NA,State and local health departments should weigh the resources needed to implement incoming traveler monitoring against community mitigation activities, understanding that the priorities of each might shift during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in the control of infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3).
NA,Among &gt;10 million annual admissions to U.S. jails, approximately 55% of detainees are released back into their communities each week (4); in addition, staff members at correctional and detention facilities are members of their local communities.
NA,Thus, high rates of COVID-19 in correctional and detention facilities also have the potential to influence broader community transmission.
NA,In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) began implementing surveillance for COVID-19 among correctional and detention facilities in Louisiana and identified cases and outbreaks in many facilities.
NA,In response, LDH and CDC developed and deployed the COVID-19 Management Assessment and Response (CMAR) tool to guide technical assistance focused on infection prevention and control policies and case management with correctional and detention facilities.
NA,This report describes COVID-19 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities detected through surveillance and findings of the CMAR assessment.
NA,During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported.
NA,During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases.
NA,Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing.
NA,CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.
NA,On March 17, 2020, a member of a Skagit County, Washington, choir informed Skagit County Public Health (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill.
NA,Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms.
NA,SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18.
NA,Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases).
NA,Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%).
NA,The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice.
NA,The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1).
NA,Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5).
NA,These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances.
NA,It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread worldwide.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1).
NA,That same day, the first confirmed COVID-19-associated fatality occurred in New York City (NYC).
NA,To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
NA,Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths.
NA,As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3).
NA,Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic.
NA,The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death.
NA,The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths also does not include deaths that are not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death.
NA,Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5).
NA,Reporting of excess deaths might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.
NA,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV-2 has shown once again that coronaviruses (CoVs) in animals are potential sources for epidemics in humans.
NA,Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen of swine with a worldwide distribution.
NA,Here, we implemented and described an approach to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV following its emergence in the pig population.
NA,We performed an integrated analysis of full genome sequence data from 21 newly-sequenced viruses, along with comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data collected globally over the last 15 years.
NA,We found four distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV, which differ in their geographic circulation patterns.
NA,Interestingly, we identified more frequent intra- and inter-lineage recombination and higher virus genetic diversity in the Chinese lineages compared with the US lineage where pigs are raised in different farming systems and ecological environments.
NA,Most recombination breakpoints are located in the ORF1ab gene rather than in genes encoding structural proteins.
NA,We also identified five amino acids under positive selection in the spike protein suggesting a role for adaptive evolution.
NA,According to structural mapping, three positively selected sites are located in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, which is the most likely involved in binding to a carbohydrate receptor, while the other two are located in or near the fusion peptide of the S2 subunit and thus might affect membrane fusion.
NA,Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission.
NA,Our findings provide new insights into the evolution and dispersal of PDCoV that contribute to our understanding of the critical factors involved in coronaviruses emergence.
NA,Coronaviruses (CoVs) exhibit a pronounced propensity for interspecies transmission as illustrated by important emerging viruses in humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS)-CoV, as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 that is causing a major human pandemic.
NA,A better understanding of the evolutionary process leading to viral emergence may help unravel the principles of cross-species transmission and therefore assist in preventing future introductions into new host populations.
NA,Here, we examined the evolution and spread of an emerging coronavirus that likely transmitted from birds to pigs and caused sustained epidemics in Asia and the United States.
NA,We integrated viral full genome sequence analysis and comprehensive surveillance data to examine the evolution of emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and in particular the factors driving ongoing circulation and recent cases in China.
NA,We found evidence for adaptive evolution of this emerging virus in the absence of vaccine immune pressure, with important amino acids under positive selection, as well as frequent inter- and intra-lineage recombination events in the Asian lineages.
NA,Breeding patterns and ecological environment could play an important role in swine coronavirus evolution, leading to differences in recombination and population diversity.
NA,Using phylogeographic approaches, we further shed light on the dispersal history and dynamics of the China lineage of PDCoV.
NA,Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geographic dispersal of genetic lineages of PDCoV in China and suggests that southern China acted as a source of transmission.
NA,Modeling how the virus spread in China will allow the prioritization of areas for swine coronavirus surveillance in the future.
NA,These findings have important implications for preventing the emergence of coronaviruses in livestock and for controlling their spread in Asian countries.
NA,The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in over 2.3 million confirmed cases and over 160,000 deaths.
NA,The impact of COVID-19 on surgical practice is widespread ranging from workforce and staffing issues, procedural prioritisation, viral transmission risk intraoperatively, changes to perioperative practice and ways of working alongside the impact on surgical education and training.
NA,Whilst there has been a growing literature base describing the early clinical course of COVID-19 and on aspects of critical care related to treating these patients, there has been a dearth of evidence on how this pandemic will affect surgical practice.
NA,This paper seeks to review the current evidence and offers recommendations for changes to surgical practice to minimise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,COVID-19 is characterized by risk of nosocomial transmission; however, the extent of environmental contamination and its potential contribution of environmental contamination to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are poorly understood.
NA,This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
NA,Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples.
NA,The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P&lt;0.05).
NA,The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and ICU, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P=0.238).
NA,The top five sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%).
NA,Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission.
NA,These results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices and enhanced hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.
NA,The transmission of COVID-19 is about to come under control within China, however, an emerging challenge to the Chinese authorities is reverse transmission due to COVID-19 patients/carriers evacuating from overseas to China.
NA,We analysed the epidemiological characteristics of 311 Chinese citizens evacuated from Iran.
NA,All confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst the returnees were displayed by the spatial distribution pattern of the extent of COVID-19 infection.
NA,Characteristics that differed significantly amongst these returnees compared to the original infected cohorts in Gansu were mean age, occupation and sex.
NA,Differences observed between infected patients and non-patients amongst returnees were age, sex, race, occupation, the use of facemasks, and residential situation in Iran.
NA,The clinical features that were significantly related to infection were chill, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea.
NA,Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated that infected returnees had resided within Iranian provinces that had experienced high levels of COVID-19.
NA,The spatial distribution of the original homes of these returnees before departure for Iran demonstrated that returnees will largely return to northwest China, to regions that have only experienced low levels of infection within China.
NA,Blocking the reverse transmission of COVID-19 is critical in preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous suffering and huge economic losses.
NA,We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants.
NA,We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain.
NA,While the majority of the cases were recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster human-to-human transmission.
NA,There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>: 0.00002 mol m<sup>-2</sup>), a low reduction in CO (&lt;0.03 mol m<sup>-2</sup>), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1-0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February-March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns.
NA,Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m<sup>-3</sup> across a large part of the globe during April-July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread.
NA,Our findings suggest that there is ample scope for restoring the global environment from the ill-effects of anthropogenic activities through temporary shutdown measures.
NA,On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus was declared a global pandemic.
NA,The disease was named COVID-19 standing for coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,The objectives were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
NA,In this prospective descriptive study, 15 confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 between 18th March and April 7, 2020 were followed-up till discharge.
NA,There were 15 reported patients infected by 3 imported index cases from Europe.
NA,The mean age of the patients was 28.06 (SD: 16.42 years).
NA,The patients' age stratification was as follows: 0-5 (2, 13.3%); 6-18 (2, 13.3); 19-50 (10, 66.7%), and 51-64 years (1, 6.7%).
NA,The patients were male (9, 60.0%) and female (6, 40.0%).
NA,Most of the patients had mild disease severity (13, 86.7%), followed by mild-moderate (1, 6.7%) and moderate-severe (1, 6.7%).
NA,The study revealed that 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 9 patients were symptomatic.
NA,The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%).
NA,All patients were recovered and discharged over a median of 8 between 8 and 21 days.
NA,The mean and Std. deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21).
NA,All COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission.
NA,The majority of cases were mild illnesses with full recovery.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and caused the pandemic respiratory disease, COVID-19<sup>1,2</sup>.
NA,In 2003, the closely related SARS-CoV had been detected in domestic cats and a dog<sup>3</sup>.
NA,However, little is known about the susceptibility of domestic pet mammals to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Two out of fifteen dogs from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong SAR were found to be infected using quantitative RT-PCR, serology, sequencing the viral genome, and in one dog, virus isolation.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a 17-year-old neutered male Pomeranian from five nasal swabs collected over a 13-day period.
NA,A 2.5-year-old male German Shepherd dog had SARS CoV-2 RNA on two occasions and virus was isolated from nasal and oral swabs.
NA,Both dogs had antibody responses detected using plaque reduction neutralization assays.
NA,Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases.
NA,The animals remained asymptomatic during quarantine.
NA,The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,It is unclear whether infected dogs can transmit the virus to other animals or back to humans.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses detected in horseshoe bats, has spread across the world and impacted global healthcare systems and economy<sup>1,2</sup>.
NA,A suitable small animal model is needed to support vaccine and therapy development.
NA,We report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters.
NA,Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells, and in areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 post-inoculation (dpi), followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia on 7 dpi.
NA,Viral antigen was also found in the duodenum epithelial cells with viral RNA detected in feces.
NA,Notably, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naïve hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols.
NA,Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient.
NA,Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA.
NA,Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies.
NA,Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral disease that is caused by the novel virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,COVID-19 has become pandemic since December 2019, when the first case developed in Wuhan, China.
NA,Patients receiving hemodialysis are more vulnerable to viral transmission because their immune functions are impaired and they receive treatment within a narrow space.
NA,Calling on previous experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during the 2015 outbreak, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy quickly formed a COVID-19 task force team to develop a manual before the first index case was diagnosed in the hemodialysis unit.
NA,This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within hemodialysis facilities, which were developed to protect patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers from this highly transmissible virus.
NA,The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.
NA,We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and hemodialysis patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In the context of serious coronavirus epidemic, it is critical that pregnant women not be ignored potentially life-saving interventions.
NA,So, this study was designed to improve the quality of care by health providers through what they need to know about coronavirus during pregnancy and childbirth.
NA,We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases was performed for published in English, before 25 March 2020.
NA,Finally, 29 papers which had covered the topic more appropriately were included in the study.
NA,The results of the systematic review of the existing literature are presented in the following nine sections: Symptoms of the COVID-19 in pregnancy, Pregnancy management, Delivery Management, Mode of delivery, Recommendations for health care provider in delivery, Neonatal outcomes, Neonatal care, Vertical Transmission, Breastfeeding.
NA,In conclusion, improving quality of care in maternal health, as well as educating, training, and supporting healthcare providers in infection management to be prioritized.
NA,Sharing data can help to countries that to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with the COVID-19.
NA,Background and purpose - COVID-19 is among the most impactful pandemics that the society has experienced.
NA,Orthopedic surgery involves procedures generating droplets and aerosols and there is concern amongst surgeons that otherwise rational precautionary principles are being set aside due to lack of scientific evidence and a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).
NA,This narrative review attempts to translate relevant knowledge into practical recommendations for healthcare workers involved in orthopedic surgery on patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
NA,Patients and methods - We unsystematically searched in PubMed, reference lists, and the WHO's web page for relevant publications concerning problems associated with the PPE used in perioperative practice when a patient is COVID-19 positive or suspected to be.
NA,A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3.
NA,Results - Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice.
NA,Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks.
NA,Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown.Interpretation - Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available.
NA,Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.
NA,In the current absence of a vaccine for COVID-19, public health responses aim to break the chain of infection by focusing on the mode of transmission.
NA,We reviewed the current evidence on the transmission dynamics and on pathogenic and clinical features of COVID-19 to critically identify any gaps in the current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines.
NA,In this study, we reviewed global COVID-19 IPC guidelines by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
NA,Guidelines from 2 high-income countries (Australia and United Kingdom) and from 1 middle-income country (China) were also reviewed.
NA,We searched publications in English on 'PubMed' and Google Scholar.
NA,We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission.
NA,We then compared these findings with the recommended IPC measures.
NA,Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route.
NA,However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other.
NA,Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures.
NA,However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable.
NA,IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission.
NA,This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought challenges to delivery of care for older adults on inpatient psychiatry.
NA,We describe two cases: patient A, a 62-year-old woman who initially refused screening for potential COVID-19, bringing up questions about threshold for capacity when public health is at risk and questions about whether screening for infection should be different in older adults.
NA,The other case, patient B, is that of an 83-year-old man who was on the unit when patient A tested positive, and brought up concerns for risk of dissemination in the context of wandering, spitting behaviors, and inability to adhere to room isolation or masking measures.
NA,We review measures taken to decrease risk of transmission and improve screening for infection in older adults.
NA,Minimize exposure to the SARS-CoV-2, reduce the chances of cross-transmission between patients and healthcare personnel, and prevent the development of postoperative complications from the management of patients with eye diseases during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19).
NA,COVID-19 literature review and consensus establishment between different Spanish ophthalmology societies in order to provide guidelines and recommendations of maximum resources primarily conditioned by the state of alert, confinement and social distancing that occurs in Spain since March 16, 2020.
NA,The recommendations will promote the adoption of action and protection measures for eye care in outpatient clinics, surgical areas and hospitalization, for unconfirmed (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and confirmed COVID-19 patients.
NA,Measures must be adapted to the circumstances and availability of personal protective equipment in each of the centers and Autonomous Communities, which will be updated according to the pandemic phases and the measures adopted by the Spanish Government.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, attention to the potential health risks to the population caused by coronavirus should prevail over the possible progression of the common eye diseases.
NA,Ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals must assume a possible progression of these diseases due to the impossibility of adequate patient follow-up.
NA,Proper strategies to minimise the risk of infection in individuals handling the bodies of deceased persons infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are urgently needed.
NA,The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies.
NA,We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases.
NA,We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews.
NA,We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses.
NA,We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability).
NA,A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
NA,A second reviewer verified the data and assessments.
NA,We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.
NA,The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission.
NA,We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them.
NA,We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps.
NA,While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies.
NA,While this review highlights major research gaps, it allows interested entities to build their own guidance.
NA,Cleveland Clinic recognized the importance of mitigating community transmission of COVID-19 by keeping people at home.
NA,Patient-care activities quickly pivoted to remote touches, preserving continuity through a variety of digital and telephonic modalities.
NA,As the number of confirmed cases grew, standardizing home-based care became critical to managing high-risk patients, moderating the risk of exposure for healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of community spread through appropriate education on home-based care for exposed or infected individuals.
NA,This novel, team-based approach to caring for patients with COVID-19 incorporates a self-monitoring app for patient engagement, monitors symptoms for early intervention, and promotes a holistic view of care.
NA,Since first reported in December 2019, the novel RNA betacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world with, as of the 3rd May 2020, 3.3 million confirmed cases with more than 230,000 deaths worldwide and more than 200 countries affected.
NA,The most common symptoms reported include dry cough, fever and fatigue with ground-glass opacification bilaterally in the lungs on imaging and lymphopenia on haematological analysis.
NA,In severe cases the patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi organ failure which can lead to death.
NA,Transmission of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) is via direct contact or via droplets spread by a cough or sneeze from an infected individual.
NA,The difficulty in disease detection and containment has been the long course of COVID-19.
NA,Current evidence shows an incubation period of up to 14 days post exposure to the virus, and on average most patients first display symptoms on day five after initial exposure.
NA,More importantly, carriers are contagious even during this preceding asymptomatic incubation phase of the disease.
NA,On 23rd March 2020 the UK government released self-isolation guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2.
NA,The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known.
NA,To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation in a sample of the UK public.
NA,This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey.
NA,Sexual activity was measured using the following question: &quot;On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?
NA,&quot; Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation.
NA,The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. 868 individuals were included in this study.
NA,There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years.
NA,During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week.
NA,Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing.
NA,In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%.
NA,Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption.
NA,This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing.
NA,Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings.
NA,Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic.
NA,Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.
NA,The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many medical practices in order to provide additional protection to both our patients and our healthcare providers.
NA,In many cases this includes seeing patients through electronic means such as telehealth or telephone rather than seeing them in person.
NA,Asthma exacerbations cannot always be treated in this way.
NA,Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists.
NA,The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus.
NA,Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.
NA,We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy.
NA,Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.
NA,Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.
NA,We paired high-resolution travel-time metrics with a SARS-CoV-2 testing location database in the United States.
NA,Median travel time to testing sites is longer in counties with lower population density, and a higher percent of minority and uninsured individuals.
NA,Differential geographic accessibility to testing can recapitulate healthcare disparities and bias transmission estimates.
NA,New cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are reported daily worldwide.
NA,What began as a localized outbreak of an epizootic disease has now become a pandemic of unprecedented proportions, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1].
NA,In South America, as of April 30, 2020, Brazil has the highest number of confirmed cases (n=80 246), followed by Peru (n=36 976) and Ecuador (n=24 934).
NA,It is important to note that the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South America was announced on February 26, 2020, described as an imported case.
NA,Local transmission has followed a geometric progression [2].
NA,The proximity required of a thorough biomicroscopic slit-lamp examination may put ophthalmologists at increased risk for respiratory-borne infection with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Conjunctivitis has been described in a few patients with COVID-19 and other coronavirus syndromes.
NA,Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the conjunctival secretions or tears of patients with COVID-19 and conjunctivitis, transmission of infection through respiratory droplets to ophthalmologists without eye protection or masks may be the bigger concern.
NA,: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over four million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide.
NA,A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published in scientific journals, as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination.
NA,Yet, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is missing.
NA,The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the current SARS-CoV-2 full genome data, in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signal, to inform and guide the scientific community.
NA,We used maximum likelihood based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments, assembled from GISAID data released between March and April 2020.
NA,Although number of high quality full-genomes is growing daily, and recent sequence data released in April contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations.
NA,At the present time, studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating.
NA,Hence, the need for interpreting current reports with caution, and continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.
NA,<AbstractText Label="INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">RR2-https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020594.
NA,In early 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged and spread by community and nosocomial transmission.
NA,Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting.
NA,This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic through the real-time locating system (RTLS) and review of the electronic medical record (EMR) at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore.
NA,Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers.
NA,The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated.
NA,The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers.
NA,Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method.
NA,Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%.
NA,The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%).
NA,RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review.
NA,Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.
NA,As of March 23, 2020, suspension of non-essential activities was declared in Mexico throughout the country in order to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,To analyze data on the first 1,510 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to describe the geographical distribution of the disease and its transmission dynamics.
NA,Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic.
NA,Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males; 44 % of initial cases were imported.
NA,Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases; however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe.
NA,In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.
NA,An outbreak of a novel, zoonotic coronavirus occurred in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China and has now affected almost the entire world, with the maximum confirmed cases being 1 521 252 as of April 10, 2020.
NA,The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it.
NA,The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV.
NA,The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases.
NA,We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19.
NA,Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion.
NA,We used the following search terms: &quot;Coronavirus&quot; or &quot;2019-nCoV&quot; or &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;SARS-CoV&quot; or &quot;MERS-CoV&quot; or &quot;Bat SARS-CoV&quot; or &quot;ACE2 receptor&quot;.
NA,This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India.
NA,The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures.
NA,Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV.
NA,Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases.
NA,An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases.
NA,Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective.
NA,Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time.
NA,Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action.
NA,First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.
NA,The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.
NA,For medical professionals in hospitals, it is nearly impossible to abide by the rules of social distancing to prevent coronavirus transmission.
NA,In order to avoid unnecessary contact between medical staff, virtual medical boards were implemented.
NA,Technical requirements for virtual boards were established overnight.
NA,Standard web cams and one license for a licensed provider of virtual boards were acquired.
NA,Most of the other technical gear required was readily available.
NA,Frequent and typical errors during the virtual boards were recorded and analyzed.
NA,Virtual boards provided the means for adequate patient care in spite of social distancing among the medical staff.
NA,Over a period of 4 weeks, 956 face-to-face contacts were avoided.
NA,Most errors occurred during first-time participation and concerned audio transmission.
NA,By muting the microphone of inactive participants, most of these errors could be avoided.
NA,Virtual boards for medical staff can be implemented with minimal effort und standard technical gear to slow down the transmission of coronavirus among medical professionals in the hospital setting.
NA,Die geltenden verschärften Hygieneempfehlungen des Robert-Koch-Instituts zur Eindämmung der Ausbreitung des Coronavirus mit Versammlungsverbot und Mindestabstand sind im innerklinischen Alltag nicht umsetzbar.
NA,Zur Minimierung von persönlichen Kontakten wurden die internen Arztkonferenzen auf ein Videokonferenzformat umgestellt.
NA,Innerhalb 24 Stunden wurde unter Anschaffung von Standard-Webcams, Auswahl eines lizenzierten Videoanbieters und Ausnutzen der bereits vorhandenen technischen Geräte die allgemeine Hygienerichtlinie für unsere Mitarbeiter umgesetzt.
NA,Häufige Fehlerquellen im Rahmen der Videokonferenz wurden protokolliert und technische Lösungen erarbeitet.
NA,Die Videokonferenz ermöglichte die adäquate Patientenversorgung und Aufrechterhaltung der gewohnten organisatorischen Abläufe.
NA,In 4 Wochen konnten 956 persönliche Kontakte vermieden werden.
NA,Die meisten Fehler traten im Rahmen der ersten Teilnahme einer Person oder Erstanmeldung eines Gerätes auf.
NA,Die häufigsten Fehler betrafen die Tonqualität und konnten umgangen werden, indem nur an der Diskussion beteiligte Teilnehmer ihr Mikrofon für die Sprechdauer aktivierten.
NA,Mitarbeiterkonferenzen im Videoformat können mit geringem personellem und technischem Aufwand etabliert werden, um der Ausbreitung des Coronavirus unter medizinischem Personal entgegenzuwirken.
NA,Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is widespread in cattle and wild ruminant populations throughout the world.
NA,The virus causes neonatal calf diarrhea and winter dysentery in adult cattle, as well as upper and lower respiratory tract infection in young cattle.
NA,We isolated and deep sequenced whole genomes of BCoV from calves with respiratory distress in the south-west of France and conducted a comparative genome analysis using globally collected BCoV sequences to provide insights into the genomic characteristics, evolutionary origins, and global diversity of BCoV.
NA,Molecular clock analyses allowed us to estimate that the BCoV ancestor emerged in the 1940s, and that two geographically distinct lineages diverged from the 1960s-1970s.
NA,A recombination event in the spike gene (breakpoint at nt 1100) may be at the origin of the genetic divergence sixty years ago.
NA,Little evidence of genetic mixing between the spatially segregated lineages was found, suggesting that BCoV genetic diversity is a result of a global transmission pathway that occurred during the last century.
NA,However, we found variation in evolution rates between the European and non-European lineages indicating differences in virus ecology.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic originated in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare an official global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
NA,In Hong Kong, clinicians and other healthcare personnel collaborated closely to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 and minimize the cross-transmission of disease among hospital staff members.
NA,In the field of otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) and its various subspecialties, contingency plans were required for patient bookings in outpatient clinics, surgeries in operating rooms, protocols in wards and other services.
NA,Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles into their environments via body secretions.
NA,Therefore, otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel in this specialty face a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and must remain vigilant when performing examinations and procedures involving the nose and throat.
NA,In this article, we share our experiences of the planning and logistics undertaken to provide safe and efficient OHNS practices over the last 2 months, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,We hope that our experiences will serve as pearls for otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel working in institutes that serve large numbers of patients every day, particularly with regard to the sharing of clinical and administrative tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Approximately 12% to 15% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection require invasive ventilation via endotracheal intubation.
NA,The key to minimizing risk of disease transmission during this aerosol-generating procedure is careful preparation, which includes having necessary equipment and medications on hand as well as an experienced intubation team who can troubleshoot any unforeseen complications.
NA,Personal protective equipment should be donned and doffed in the presence of an assistant (ie, &quot;buddy&quot; system).
NA,The COVID-19 infection outbreak has aroused increasing attention and affected thousands of people nationwide.
NA,The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission.
NA,The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India.
NA,In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India.
NA,Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case.
NA,Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month).
NA,Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s).
NA,There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes.
NA,These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment.
NA,The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly.
NA,Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources.
NA,These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.
NA,The COVID-19 infection is an aggressive viral illness with high risk of transmission during otolaryngology examination and surgery.
NA,Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully.
NA,The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold's abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention.
NA,What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic?
NA,Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality.
NA,The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature.
NA,Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources.
NA,Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic.
NA,To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity.
NA,Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.
NA,This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.
NA,U.S.
NA,Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities house thousands of undocumented immigrants in environments discordant with the public health recommendations to reduce the transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.
NA,Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes.
NA,We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario.
NA,Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks.
NA,We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees.
NA,As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities.
NA,Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.
NA,The aim of this study was to elicit the views of medical faculty students regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,This descriptive study was performed with Ondokuz Mayıs University Medical Faculty students on 24-27 March, 2020.
NA,The Medical Faculty currently has 2051 students.
NA,A questionnaire was used as a data collection tool.
NA,For that purpose, the authors designed a questionnaire specifically for this research via the &quot;Google Forms&quot; web.
NA,This consisted of 40 open- and close-ended questions.
NA,The questionnaire was completed by 1375 (67.1%) students.
NA,Accordingly, 52.4% of medical students reported feeling mentally unwell.
NA,Although 50.8% of medical students reported generally/usually obtaining information about COVID-19 through the social media, 82.0% did not trust information/messages arriving through the social media and WhatsApp.
NA,We found that 86.7% of students regarded frequent hand washing as the most important means of protection against COVID-19, and 19.3% of students did not regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a severe public health problem for Turkey at that moment.
NA,In addition, 61.6% of students stated that a suppression strategy involving tight restrictions need to be applied to being the pandemic under control in Turkey.
NA,Use can be made of medical students in the transmission of accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Students can be excellent activists on these subjects in countries in which medical education is suspended.
NA,Measures therefore need to be taken concerning the transmission of up to date and accurate information to medical students.
NA,The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in more than 250 countries has become a serious threat to the health of people around the world.
NA,Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms.
NA,Therefore, in this study, was discussed the role of environmental factors and conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed as well as food, water and sewage, air, insects, inanimate surfaces, and hands in COVID-19 transmission.
NA,The results of studies on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others.
NA,Temperature increase and sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on surfaces.
NA,When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 °C, the cumulative number of cases decreases by 0.86%.
NA,According to the latest evidence, the presence of coronavirus in the sewer has been confirmed, but there is no evidence that it is transmitted through sewage or contaminated drinking water.
NA,Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease.
NA,According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology.
NA,The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet.
NA,There have been no reports of SARS-COV-2 transmission by blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge to the care of patients with haematological malignancies.
NA,Viral pneumonia is known to cause disproportionately severe disease in patients with cancer, and patients with lymphoma, myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are likely to be at particular risk of severe disease related to COVID-19.
NA,This statement has been developed by consensus among authors from Australia and New Zealand.
NA,We aim to provide supportive guidance to clinicians making individual patient decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular during periods that access to healthcare resources may be limited.
NA,General recommendations include those to minimise patient exposure to COVID-19, including the use of telehealth, avoidance of non-essential visits and minimisation of time spent by patients in infusion suites and other clinical areas.
NA,This statement also provides recommendations where appropriate in assessing indications for therapy, reducing therapy-associated immunosuppression and reducing healthcare utilisation in patients with specific haematological malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Specific decisions regarding therapy of haematological malignancies will need to be individualised, based on disease risk, risks of immunosuppression, rates of community transmission of COVID-19 and available local healthcare resources.
NA,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has attracted worldwide attention.
NA,The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs).
NA,The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after one-month stressful suffering.
NA,377 HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1st and 5th.
NA,The demographic information was collected firstly.
NA,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSS and sleep quality.
NA,Results showed that one month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSS was 3.8% in HCWs.
NA,Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSS with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI= 1.388-3.286).
NA,HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyper-arousal symptoms (hazard ratio= 4.026, 95% CI= 1.233-13.140).
NA,There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSS (Z value= 6.014, p&lt;0.001) and among different groups with various contact frequency (Chi-square=7.307, p=0.026).
NA,Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSS through sleep quality (coefficient =1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998).
NA,In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,Understanding the mental health response after a public health emergency might help HCWs and communities prepare for a population's response to disaster.
NA,Strict infection control measures in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic are expected to remain for an extended period.
NA,In aesthetic clinics, most procedures are provided on one to one basis by the physician or therapist.
NA,In such a scenario, guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are of particular importance.
NA,An online meeting of an international group of experts in the field of aesthetic medicine, with experience in administration of an aesthetic clinic, was convened.
NA,The meeting aimed to provide a set of consensus guidelines to protect clinic staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,Consensus guidelines for 'preferred practices' were provided for scheduling of patients, patient evaluation and triaging, and for safety precautions about the different procedures.
NA,Procedures were categorized into low-risk, moderate risk, and high-risk based on the likelihood of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the patient to the treating physician or therapist.
NA,While not intended to be complete or exhaustive, these guidelines provide sound infection control measures for aesthetic practices.
NA,Since guidelines regarding safety measures and use of PPEs may vary from country to country, the local guidelines should also be followed to prevent COVID-19 infection in aesthetic clinics.

NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global health threats facing humanity in recent memory.
NA,This study aimed to explore influences on hygienic practices, a set of key transmission behaviours, in relation to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change (Michie et al., 2011).
NA,Data from the first wave of a longitudinal survey study were used, launched in the early stages of the UK COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Participants were 2025 adults aged 18 and older, representative of the UK population, recruited by a survey company from a panel of research participants.
NA,Participants self-reported motivation, capability, and opportunity to enact hygienic practices during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Using regression models, we found that all three COM-B components significantly predicted good hygienic practices, with motivation having the greatest influence on behaviour.
NA,Breaking this down further, the subscales psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation positively influenced behaviour.
NA,Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores.
NA,Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices.
NA,Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.
NA,Hubei province in China has completed cycle of quarantine-resumption in 23<sup>rd</sup> Janauary and 8<sup>th</sup> April 2020, providing a unique opportunity as for now to assess its intervention impact and the pattern of SARS-COV-2 transmission during the quarantine period.
NA,In this study, we evaluate the impact of the metropolitan-wide quarantine on the trend and transmission route of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China.
NA,The intervention reduces more than 70% of new infections in both households and the public space, as well as the deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,Household transmission is the dominant route of disease spread regardless of quarantine.
NA,This will provide important evidence and scientific insights to other worldwide countries that are currently under quarantine.
NA,Particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the outdoor air pollutants that are major factors in diseases, causing especially adverse respiratory effects in humans.
NA,On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance.
NA,The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections.
NA,We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases.
NA,Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system.
NA,Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19.
NA,Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.
NA,This deserves immediate and in-depth experimental investigations.
NA,Airborne transmission is a pathway of contagion that is still not sufficiently investigated despite the evidence in the scientific literature of the role it can play in the context of an epidemic.
NA,While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic.
NA,To this end, virus air emission data are needed.
NA,Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases.
NA,In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking, whispering), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed.
NA,The results showed that high quanta emission rates (&gt;100 quanta h<sup>-1</sup>) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (&lt;1 quantum h<sup>-1</sup>).
NA,The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures.
NA,The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.
NA,Majority of countries across the globe have employed improving building ventilation, quarantine, social distancing, and disinfections as a general measure of preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions.
NA,However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation.
NA,Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems.
NA,Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings.
NA,Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM<sub>10</sub>; aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 μm) and fine (PM<sub>2.5</sub>; aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments.
NA,In fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and residential buildings.
NA,It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.
NA,There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin.
NA,As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts.
NA,Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America.
NA,This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected.
NA,We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model.
NA,Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.
NA,The Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented disruption in health care delivery around the world.
NA,In an effort to prevent hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections, most hospitals have severely curtailed elective surgery, performing only surgeries if the patient's survival or permanent function would be compromised by a delay in surgery.
NA,As hospitals emerge from the pandemic, it will be necessary to progressively increase surgical activity at a time when hospitals continue to care for Covid-19 patients.
NA,In an attempt to mitigate the risk of nosocomial infection, we have created a patient care pathway designed to minimize risk of exposure of patients coming in to the hospital for scheduled procedures.
NA,The &quot;Covid-minimal surgery pathway&quot; is a predetermined patient flow, that dictates the locations, personnel and materials that come in contact with our cancer surgery population, designed to minimize risk for virus transmission.
NA,We outline the approach that allowed a large academic medical center to create a Covid-minimal cancer surgery pathway within 7 days of initiating discussions.
NA,Although the pathway represents a combination of recommended practices, there is not data to support its efficacy.
NA,We share the pathway concept and our experience so that others wishing to similarly align staff and resources towards the protection of patients, may have an easier time navigating the process.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is emerged in China on December 2019 and now declared pandemic by WHO.
NA,We describe the case of an Italian 7-week-old suckling baby SARS-CoV-2-positive only by cell culture method with no clinical suspicion and/or risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,The patient was referred to the hospital with signs and symptoms of infection of the upper respiratory tract before the virus was spread to the province.
NA,Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including SARS-CoV-2 virus.
NA,Bacteria referred to resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs.
NA,No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate.
NA,The baby was discharged in good conditions after 3 days of hospitalization.
NA,Later a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR performed both on cell culture and on the stored aliquot of the original sample.
NA,The virus isolate was named SARS-Cov-2/human/Parma/1/2020.
NA,Cell culture still remains the only reference diagnostic method also for emerging viruses, allowing to reveal cytopathogenic viruses and demonstrating their infectivity.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic first originated in Wuhan the capital of Hubei province, China in December 2019 and then spread globally.
NA,It is caused by SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Until 1<sup>st</sup> April 2020, the number of cases worldwide was recorded to be 823,626 with 40,598 deaths.
NA,Most of the reported cases were adults with few cases described in children and neonates.
NA,We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the disease characterisation in paediatric age group including the possibility of vertical transmission to the neonates.
NA,Articles published up to 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2020 in PubMed and google Scholar were considered for this study.
NA,The most frequently reported symptoms were cough 49% (95% CI: 42 - 55%) and fever 47% (95% CI: 41- 53%).
NA,Lymphopenia and increased Procalcitonin were recorded in (21%, 95% CI: 12 - 30%) and (28%, 95% CI: 18 - 37%) respectively.
NA,No sex difference for COVID-19 was found in paediatric age group (p = 0.7).
NA,Case fatality rate was 0%.
NA,Four out of 58 neonates (6.8%) born to COVID-19 confirmed mothers tested positive for the disease.
NA,The disease trajectory in Paediatric patients has good prognosis compared to adults.
NA,Intensive care unit and death are rare.
NA,Vertical transmission and virus shedding in breast milk are yet to be established.
NA,On 31st December 2019, China notified the World Health Organization of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia from patients at a local seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei, China, responsible for a new coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused COVID-19 disease, which spread rapidly around the world.
NA,WHO declared a state of pandemic (11th March, 2020), which has caused more than 1 million infected and more than 110,000 deaths; it was observed that up to 29% of those infected were health care personnel.
NA,The main route of transmission of SARS-CoV2 is through respiratory secretions and direct contact with contaminated surfaces and material.
NA,The pandemic induced an international saturation of health care services and a rupture in the supply chain of protective equipment for healthcare personnel, which poses a high occupational risk to all.
NA,Based on the different healthcare systems, human resources, infrastructure and medical emergencies that will warrant the conduct of clinical neurophysiology studies and the lack of a guide for the management of the situation, it was decided by an expert task force of the Latin American Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology to carry out these guidelines for the protection of patient and healthcare professionals conducting clinical neurophysiological studies.
NA,Owing to the frequent travel connections between Wuhan and Zhejiang, Zhejiang was the third worst-affected province in China with 1,205 cases confirmed before 26 February 2020.
NA,The transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was monitored in Zhejiang, accounting for the transmissions from imported cases.
NA,Even though Zhejiang was one of the worst-affected provinces, an interruption of disease transmission (i.e. instantaneous reproduction numbers &lt;1) was observed in early/mid-February after a comprehensive set of interventions combating the outbreak.
NA,A novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of respiratory infections (Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID-19) first discovered in Wuhan, China is responsible for a new illness that has been found to affect the lungs and airways of patients with associated symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
NA,In the light of few cases recorded so far in West Africa there is tendency for complacency.
NA,The region needs to make strategic plans based on available evidence to enable them effectively deal with this rapidly evolving pandemic.
NA,At this very moment countries like China, Italy, France, Spain, Iran, UK and many others are witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus and increasing numbers of severe disease and death particularly among elderly patients with other comorbidities.
NA,The reality of the seriousness of this pandemic is alarming.
NA,Government of member states of ECOWAS need to prepare themselves by building capacity as well as implement evidenced-based steps to mitigate this rapidly evolving pandemic by testing persons presenting with symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath), isolating and treating those found positive, tracing and quarantining contacts, implementing social distancing as well as optimizing human and material endowment to allow healthcare workers offer safe quality clinical care for affected patients to prevent secondary infection among healthcare workers.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest challenge to date faced by the medical community in the 21st century.
NA,The rate of rapid dissemination, magnitude of viral contagiousness, person to person transmission at an asymptomatic phase of illness pose a unique and dangerous challenge for all patients, including neonatal and obstetric patients.
NA,Although scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, nature of transmission, and efficacy of mitigation strategies grow, neither a cure or vaccine have been developed.
NA,While COVID-19 is primarily a disease of older patients, infection is now seen across all age demographics with reports of illness in pregnant patients and infants.
NA,Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial.
NA,Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection.
NA,The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.
NA,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of many pneumonia cases in China and eventually declared as a pandemic as the virus spread globally.
NA,Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients.
NA,We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
NA,This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19.
NA,Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020.
NA,All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion.
NA,Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period.
NA,Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission.
NA,COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course.
NA,Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications.
NA,These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.
NA,COVID-19 was declared a global health emergency.
NA,Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations.
NA,The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020.
NA,Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics.
NA,Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified.
NA,Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3).
NA,Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines.
NA,As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available.
NA,This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.
NA,Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.
NA,For the past several months, we have witnessed one of the greatest global health challenges experienced by humankind.
NA,This unprecedented COVID-19 viral pandemic, characterized by its enigmatic nature and bewildering spread, respects no borders and has nearly paralyzed healthcare systems throughout the world.
NA,Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures.
NA,Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
NA,It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.
NA,An epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide.
NA,With the rapid increase in the number of infections, children with COVID-19 appear to be rising.
NA,Most research findings regarding adult cases, which are not always transferrable to children.
NA,Evidence-based studies are still expected to formulate clinical decisions for pediatric patients.
NA,In this review, we evaluated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features from 2,597 pediatric patients of COVID-19 that reported recently.
NA,We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults, it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%).
NA,Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to happen in pediatric patients.
NA,Our analysis may contribute to determine the spectrum of disease in children, as well as to develop strategies to control the disease transmission.

NA,In addition to respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints suggesting possible faeco-oral transmission.
NA,The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19.
NA,A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus.
NA,Search terms for Medline included 'clinical', 'faeces', 'gastrointestinal secretions', 'stool', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2' and '2019-nCoV'.
NA,Additional searches were done in AJG, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The WHO Database, CEBM, NEJM, social media and the NICE, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints.
NA,Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus.
NA,There were 26 relevant articles identified.
NA,Combining study results demonstrated that 53·9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive.
NA,Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms.
NA,There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus.
NA,There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19.
NA,Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route.
NA,This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.
NA,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person.
NA,Cases have been detected in most countries worldwide.
NA,Italy is one of the most affected countries as of 30 March 2020.
NA,Public health response includes a rapid reorganization of the Italian National Healthcare System in order to reduce transmission of COVID-19 within hospitals and healthcare facilities, while optimizing the assistance to patients with severe COVID-19 complications.
NA,We analysed the actions that were taken in three ophthalmology centres in northern Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and how these measures affected patient's attendance.
NA,In addition, due to the rapidly evolving scenario, we reviewed the evidence available during the course of this pandemic.
NA,A full reorganization of ophthalmology services is mandatory according to current existing infection containment measures in order to continue dispensing urgent procedures without endangering the community with amplification of the diffusion chain.
NA,Ophthalmologists are considered at elevated risk of exposure when caring patients and vice versa, due to their close proximity during eye examination.
NA,High volumes of procedures typically generated by ophthalmologists with concurrent implications on the risk of infection are considered when re-assessing healthcare facilities reorganization.
NA,Containment measures in the event of pandemic due to infective agents should be well known by healthcare professionals and promptly applied in order to mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak.
NA,Back-projection is an epidemiological analysis method that was developed to estimate HIV incidence using surveillance data on AIDS diagnoses.
NA,It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts.
NA,Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period.
NA,This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia.
NA,It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns.
NA,For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels.
NA,These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures.
NA,It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections.
NA,Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed.
NA,Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.
NA,The risk of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery in COVID-19 pregnant patients is currently a topic of debate.
NA,Obstetric norms on vaginal birth assistance to reduce the potential risk of perinatal infection should be promoted by ensuring that the risk of contamination from maternal anus and faecal material is reduced during vaginal delivery.
NA,The purpose of testing for any communicable disease is to support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of individual patients and to describe transmission dynamics.
NA,The novel coronavirus is formally named SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease state resulting from an infection is known as COVID-19.
NA,Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health officials to utilise the most comprehensive, accurate and timely information available to manage the rapidly evolving COVID-19 environment.
NA,High performance sport is a unique context that may look towards comprehensive testing as a means of risk mitigation.
NA,Characteristics of the common testing options are discussed including the circumstances where additional testing may be of benefit and considerations for the associated risks.
NA,Finally, a review of the available technology that could be considered for use by medical staff at the point of care (PoC) in a high-performance sporting context is included.
NA,When an emergency-care patient is diagnosed with an emerging infectious disease, hospitals in Korea may temporarily close their emergency departments (EDs) to prevent nosocomial transmission.
NA,Since February 2020, multiple, consecutive ED closures have occurred due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Daegu.
NA,However, sudden ED closures are in contravention of laws for the provision of emergency medical care that enable the public to avail prompt, appropriate, and 24-hour emergency medical care.
NA,Therefore, this study ascertained the vulnerability of the ED at tertiary hospitals in Daegu with regard to the current standards.
NA,A revised triage and surveillance protocol has been proposed to tackle the current crisis.
NA,This study was retrospectively conducted at 6 level 1 or 2 EDs in a metropolitan city where ED closure due to COVID-19 occurred from February 18 to March 26, 2020.
NA,The present status of ED closure and patient characteristics and findings from chest radiography and laboratory investigations were assessed.
NA,Based on the experience from repeated ED closures and the modified systems that are currently used in EDs, revised triage and surveillance protocols have been developed and proposed.
NA,During the study period, 6 level 1 or 2 emergency rooms included in the study were shut down 27 times for 769 hours.
NA,Thirty-one confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom 7 died, were associated with the incidence of ED closure.
NA,Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population.
NA,The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection.
NA,The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols.
NA,Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients.
NA,In future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, efforts should be focused toward the provision of continued ED treatment with the implementation of revised triage and surveillance protocols.
NA,Corona virus disease 2019 started in December 2019 as an outbreak of unexplained pneumonias in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province of China.
NA,This illness emerged as an epidemic in China and later spread to almost all countries over the globe except Antarctica.
NA,This is caused by a beta Corona virus, which is genetically similar to SARS virus.
NA,The predominant mode of transmission is <i>via</i> droplet spread, when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks the virus is released in the respiratory secretions.
NA,As there are only a few cases of COVID 19 in neonates, there is no convincing evidence to support the possibility of vertical transmission.
NA,Clinical presentation in neonates is nonspecific, commonly observed are temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea.
NA,Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific.
NA,Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
NA,Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters.
NA,Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.
NA,We report a young Thai man from the Thai-Myanmar border suffering from 2 days of fever and myalgia without respiratory tract signs or symptoms.
NA,He reported no history of travel through an area with confirmed COVID-19 cases or contact with sick persons.
NA,After excluding malaria and dengue, which are common causative agents of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) in Thailand, chest radiography was performed according to the patient triage protocol of our institute for AUFI during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Chest radiography revealed findings compatible with pneumonia.
NA,Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.
NA,The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission.
NA,Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.
NA,This fact necessitates vigilant awareness in clinical investigation, management, and infection control, especially in tropical resource-limited settings.
NA,This paper aims to share our experience in reorganising our general radiography service during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from the viewpoint of a large tertiary referral medical centre.
NA,Re-organization of radiographic manpower, patient segregation, and modification of routine radiographic practices are key measures to help radiographic services deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,More specifically, emphasis on deploying more mobile radiographic units, segregating equipment, developing consistent image acquisition workflows, and strict adherence to infection control protocols are paramount to minimize the possibility of in-hospital transmission and ensure a safe environment for both patients and staff.
NA,Streamlining communication channels between leadership and ground staff allows quick dissemination of information to ultimately facilitate safe provision of services.
NA,COVID-19 has drastically altered the way general radiography teams provide services.
NA,The institution of several key measures will allow hospitals to safely and sustainably provide radiographic services.
NA,To date, there have been zero incidences of radiographer healthcare worker transmission within our institution during the course of work.
NA,Radiographers are facing the challenge of providing high-quality services while simultaneously minimizing pathogen exposure to staff and patients.
NA,Our experience may lend support to other radiographic services respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and serve as a blueprint for future infectious disease outbreak contingency plans.
NA,In January 2020, the Chinese authorities confirmed the causative agent of an outbreak of cases with pneumonia of unknown etiology that appeared in December 2019.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO) called COVID-19 is a new virus of the coronavirus family.
NA,On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide.
NA,Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed.
NA,The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations.
NA,In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects.
NA,In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility.
NA,These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak.
NA,The pandemic involving COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, due to its severe symptoms and high transmission rate, has gone on to pose a control challenge for healthcare systems all around the world.
NA,We present the second version of the Recommendations of the Polish Medical Society of Radiology, presuming that our knowledge on COVID-19 will advance further rapidly, to the extent that further supplementation and modification will prove necessary.
NA,These Recommendations involve rules of conduct, procedures, and safety measures that should be introduced in radiology departments, as well as indications for imaging studies.
NA,The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2019), reminiscent of the 2002-SARS-CoV outbreak, has completely isolated countries, disrupted health systems and partially paralyzed international trade and travel.
NA,In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time.
NA,This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations.
NA,Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures.
NA,Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side.
NA,Coronaviruses, which were generally considered harmless to humans before 2003, have appeared again with a pandemic threatening the world since December 2019 after the epidemics of SARS and MERS.
NA,It is known that transmission from person to person is the most important way to spread.
NA,However, due to the widespread host diversity, a detailed examination of the role of animals in this pandemic is essential to effectively fight against the outbreak.
NA,Although coronavirus infections in pets are known to be predominantly related to the gastrointestinal tract, it has been observed that there are human-to-animal transmissions in this outbreak and some animals have similar symptoms to humans.
NA,Although animal-to-animal transmission has been shown to be possible, there is no evidence of animal-to-human transmission.
NA,The ongoing 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an enormous challenge for the health systems and the entire societies of the countries involved.
NA,Since at present the outbreak continues to evolve (April 2020), the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern, specifying that public health interventions aimed at the prevention of the further spread of this disease include quarantine.
NA,Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in the history of mankind.
NA,The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint.
NA,One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread.
NA,With specific reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, health authorities still adopt &quot;classical&quot; preventive interventions, namely workplace social distancing measures and quarantine, to reduce the transmission of the disease.
NA,Only the future will testify the precise overall effectiveness of preventive public health measures in containing the impact of the present coronavirus pandemic.
NA,However, what in this epidemiological scenario is already known, is that the multi-century international health value of quarantine remains essential and unavoidable.
NA,A logical strategy to contain the Covid-19 pandemic is to completely isolate everyone for 2 weeks (the incubation period of the virus).
NA,However, such a strategy can have prohibitive economic and social costs and, therefore, will be difficult to implement.
NA,At the same time, the current situation is leading to an expanding humanitarian, health and economic crisis.
NA,Based on principles of the Theory of Constraints, we propose in this article the &quot;Shutting-down Transmission Of Pandemic&quot; (STOP Covid-19) plan that would reliably contain the pandemic, mitigate its economic consequences, and boost societal confidence.
NA,This plan requires the implementation of four strategies over 90 days: (a) stop all international, domestic passenger air and intercity bus/train travel; (b) create administrative zones of about 1 million people; (c) stop all non-emergency cross-zonal travel except for transportation of goods, and (d) deploy an information-driven service value chain to control the spread of the pandemic within a zone.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was isolated from feces of a patient in China with coronavirus disease who died.
NA,Confirmation of infectious virus in feces affirms the potential for fecal-oral or fecal-respiratory transmission and warrants further study.
NA,The COVID-19, the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly across the globe.
NA,It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person's cough or sneeze.
NA,Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
NA,Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens.
NA,Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus.
NA,This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy.
NA,Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.
NA,The coronavirus pandemic outbreak is considered the most daunting public health challenge in decades.
NA,With no effective treatments and the time needed to develop a vaccine, alternatives approaches are followed to control such pandemic.
NA,To identify topics, opinions, and recommendations discussed by medical professionals about the coronavirus pandemic outbreak on social medial platform, Twitter.
NA,Using a mixed-method approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed coronavirus related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content.
NA,We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data in order to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the phenomenon using qualitative coding.
NA,Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions.
NA,Data was collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic.
NA,A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020.
NA,We identified eight topics, namely, actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, healthcare system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission.
NA,Tweets were mainly focused on actions and recommendations (28%) needed to control the pandemic.
NA,Many tweets warned about misleading information (20%) which could lead to more cases infected with the virus.
NA,Other tweets discussed general Knowledge and information (9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the healthcare systems and workers (9%).
NA,The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (8%), immunity (7%), testing (6%), and virus infection and transmission (5%).
NA,Findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms could help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during the pandemic outbreak.
NA,Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are being used to &quot;rule out&quot; infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers.
NA,It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results.
NA,To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection.
NA,Literature review and pooled analysis. 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (<i>n</i> = 1330).
NA,A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NA,A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset.
NA,Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4.
NA,On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%).
NA,This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21.
NA,Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based.
NA,Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection-particularly early in the course of infection-when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission.
NA,If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

NA,Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.
NA,COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.
NA,Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.
NA,In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.
NA,We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.
NA,By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia.
NA,WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
NA,An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.
NA,A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR.
NA,Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts).
NA,High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms.
NA,We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms.
NA,Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods.
NA,Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.
NA,Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations.
NA,Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4.
NA,The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3-4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0-5·0).
NA,Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown.
NA,One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase.
NA,Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0-99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2-32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6-8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.
NA,Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.
NA,Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred.
NA,These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.
NA,All authors are employed and all expenses covered by governmental, federal state, or other publicly funded institutions.
NA,The current global propagation of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, with slow transmission continuing in many countries, and exponential propagation in others, in which the time that took to begin this explosive spread varies greatly.
NA,It is proposed that this could be explained by cascading superspreading events, in which new infections caused by a superspreader are more likely to be highly infectious.
NA,The mechanism suggested for this is related to viral loads.
NA,Exposure to high viral loads may result in infections of high intensity, which exposes new cases to high viral loads, and so on.
NA,This notion is supported by experimental veterinary research.
NA,Increasing research reports neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement.
NA,To review the neurological aspects of SARS-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease.
NA,We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases.
NA,Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease.
NA,A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system.
NA,Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness.
NA,Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19.
NA,Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed.
NA,Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.
NA,An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen.
NA,How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research.
NA,In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, teledermatology is being favored over in-person consultation in order to avoid the possibility of virus transmission<sup>1</sup> .
NA,In France, COVID-19 wasn't known to cause cutaneous manifestations before April 6<sup>th</sup> 2020, when an alert about possible associated skin symptoms was raised to the general public and the professional social network<sup>2-4</sup> .
NA,We aimed to assess the impact of alerting about COVID-associated lesions on the activity of urgent teledermatology (TD) and the activity of dermatologic emergencies unit (DEU) of two university hospitals during this pandemic.
NA,The primary mode of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur through the spread of respiratory droplets.
NA,The objective of this study was to investigate droplet and splatter patterns resulting from common endoscopic endonasal procedures.
NA,Cadaver simulation series.
NA,Dedicated surgical laboratory.
NA,After instilling cadaver head specimens (n = 2) with fluorescein solution, endoscopic endonasal procedures were systematically performed to evaluate the quantity, size, and distance of droplets and splatter following each experimental condition.
NA,There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter noted in the measured surgical field in any direction after nasal endoscopy, septoplasty with microdebrider-assisted turbinoplasty, cold-steel functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), and all experimental conditions using an ultrasonic aspirator.
NA,Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, &lt;1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, &lt;1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, &lt;1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter.
NA,The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm).
NA,Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from routine rhinologic procedures.
NA,The droplet generation from drilling was mitigated with the use of concurrent suction.
NA,Extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, which was found to cause droplet contamination.
NA,Diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy (DFL) is a critical tool in the armamentarium of an otolaryngologist.
NA,However, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, DFL represents a high-risk procedure for patients and otolaryngologists due to the risk of aerosolization.
NA,In cases where DFL is required, in patients with COVID-19 positivity or unknown COVID-19 status, we describe the use of a modified endoscopy face mask as an adjunct to personal protection equipment to reduce occupational transmission of COVID-19 while performing DFL.
NA,Our modified endoscopy mask provides an additional barrier against the transmission of airborne pathogens.
NA,The modified endoscopy face mask may also serve as a useful tool for otolaryngologists as they return to performing more aerosol-generating procedures in the outpatient setting.
NA,This study aimed to identify escape of small-particle aerosols from a variety of masks using simulated breathing conditions.
NA,This study also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a negative-pressure environment around the face in preventing the escape of small aerosolized particles.
NA,This study is an evaluation study with specific methodology described below.
NA,This study was performed in our institution's fresh tissue laboratory.
NA,A fixed cadaver head was placed in a controlled environment with a black background, and small-particle aerosols were created using joss incense sticks (mass-median aerosol diameter of 0.28 µ).
NA,Smoke was passed through the cadaver head, and images were taken with a high-resolution camera in a standardized manner.
NA,Digital image processing was used to calculate relative amounts of small-particle escape from a variety of masks, including a standard surgical mask, a modified Ambu mask, and our negative airway pressure respirator (NAPR).
NA,Significant amounts of aerosolized particles escaped during the trials with no mask, a standard surgical mask, and the NAPR without suction.
NA,When suction was applied to the NAPR, creating a negative-pressure system, no particle escape was noted.
NA,We present a new and effective method for the study of small-particle aerosols as a step toward better understanding the spread of these particles and the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019.
NA,We also present the concept of an NAPR to better protect health care workers from aerosols generated from the upper and lower airways.
NA,We here report a case of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Japan in which the initial throat swab polymerase chain reaction result was negative The possibility of false-negative results in the early phase of disease suggest reconsideration of the feasibility of a community or national infection control framework to prevent transmission.
NA,We recommend establishing an alternative feasible system, such as self-isolation by contact history in non-endemic community and by symptoms in endemic community, not relying on the PCR examination, to minimize this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Further rapid accumulation of knowledge including incubation period, clinical course and types of transmission is warranted to control this outbreak.
NA,Preliminary evidence suggests that climate may modulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory, given high susceptibility is a core driver.
NA,Here, we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic probing different scenarios based on known coronavirus biology.
NA,We find that while variations in weather may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen the climate drives only modest changes to pandemic size.
NA,A preliminary analysis of non-pharmaceutical control measures indicates that they may moderate the pandemic-climate interaction via susceptible depletion.
NA,Our findings suggest, without effective control measures, strong outbreaks are likely in more humid climates and summer weather will not substantially limit pandemic growth.
NA,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has been described to potentially be complicated by ocular involvement.
NA,However, scant information is available regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and ocular structures tropism.
NA,We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) from December 20, 2019 to April 6, 2020, providing information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, and tears.
NA,We excluded ongoing clinical  studies as for unobtainable conclusive results.
NA,Of 2422 articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria for analysis and were included in the study.
NA,None of the studies were multinational.
NA,Among the 11 selected papers there were three original articles, one review, four letters, two editorials, and one correspondence letter.
NA,Globally, 252 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were included in our review.
NA,The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only.
NA,Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR.
NA,The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial.
NA,However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.
NA,Since there are few reports on the ocular involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, this study aimed to assess the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the tears of patients with COVID-19.
NA,In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed.
NA,The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history.
NA,The mean age of patients was 56 ± 13 years.
NA,The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1-7 days.
NA,Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling.
NA,Only one patient had conjunctivitis.
NA,Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis.
NA,All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results.
NA,Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.
NA,Therefore, possibility of ocular transmission should be considered even in the absence of ocular manifestations.
NA,Since its emergence in December 2019, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted several countries, affecting more than 90 thousand patients and making it a global public threat.
NA,The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions.
NA,Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission.
NA,Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice.
NA,In addition to the standard precautions, some special precautions that should be implemented during an outbreak have been raised in this review.
NA,The recently emerged novel coronavirus pneumonia, named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), shares several clinical characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and spread rapidly throughout China in December of 2019 (Huang et al., 2020).
NA,The pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is highly infectious.
NA,As of Apr. 9, 2020, over 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 4.0% (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).
NA,Person-to-person transmission and familial clustering have been reported (Chan et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020).
NA,However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020).
NA,It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies.
NA,Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19.
NA,In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.
NA,The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19.
NA,Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).
NA,Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.
NA,In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources.
NA,The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season.
NA,Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources.
NA,However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging.
NA,Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake.
NA,Discovered in 2017, swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), also known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) or porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), is the fifth porcine CoV identified in diarrheal piglets.
NA,The presumed name &quot;SADS-CoV&quot; may not be appropriate since current studies have not provided strong evidence for high pathogenicity of the virus.
NA,SeACoV was the most recently recognized CoV of potential bat origin prior to the novel human severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), associated with the pandemic CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Although SeACoV is recognized as a regional epizootic virus currently, it possesses the most extensive cell species tropism in vitro among known CoVs.
NA,This review summarizes the emergence of SeACoV and updates the research progress made from 2017 to early 2020, mainly focusing on the etiology, epidemiology, evolutionary perspective, potential for interspecies transmission, pathogenesis and diagnosis.
NA,The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity.
NA,In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age.
NA,This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines.
NA,The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out.
NA,There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group.
NA,Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated.
NA,Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy.
NA,Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination.
NA,A new framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding longevity research projects.
NA,This review aims to map scientific evidence in nursing care aimed at controlling coronavirus infections.
NA,A bibliographic search was conducted in the Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and WOS main databases, with no date limit and using the keywords &quot;transmission&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;contagious&quot;, &quot;spreads&quot;, &quot;coronavirinae&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;COVID 19&quot;, &quot;sars cov 2&quot;, &quot;nurses&quot; and &quot;nursing&quot;.
NA,Initially, 154 studies were identified and, after selecting them according to eligibility criteria, 16 were included.
NA,Among the main recommendations according to the available evidence are air exchange in rooms as a measure to reduce the risk of infection among patients; reinforcement of measures in intensive care units; follow-up of positive case contacts; and adequate training of professionals.
NA,The studies included in the review addressed infection prevention and control practices by analyzing risks associated with exposure and listing actions to avoid complications in critically ill patients.
NA,Patterns of case transmission, contacts and associated factors were identified.
NA,Professional knowledge and attitudes were also studied, showing the importance of good infection control training, and of sufficient equipment and adequate infrastructure.Nurses are important vectors of spread.
NA,Although there is little evidence available on the effectiveness of care to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, published studies on the prevention and control of previous outbreaks of coronavirus are of considerable value.
NA,To compile recommendations and evidence on the practical management of pregnant women with COVIC-19 in order to clarify standards of obstetric care in the face of this new disease.
NA,Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a &quot;snowball&quot; system.
NA,MeSH terms were used: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;Pregnancy&quot;, &quot;Delivery, Obstetric&quot; &quot;Pregnant Women&quot; and &quot;Maternal&quot;.
NA,As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected.
NA,No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article.
NA,A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations.
NA,The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding.
NA,Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
NA,Further studies are needed to confirm the appropriateness of many of the recommendations and guidelines for action in the specific case of pregnant women and COVIC-19.
NA,In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China.
NA,Days later, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus.
NA,This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces was named COVID-19.
NA,The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector.
NA,Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic.
NA,The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.
NA,To clarify changes in the implementation of personal protective measures among ordinary Japanese citizens from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak to the community transmission phase.
NA,This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2,141 people (50.8% men; 20-79 years).
NA,The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020 and April 1-6, 2020, respectively.
NA,Participants were asked how often they implemented the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys.
NA,The prevalence of 3 of the 5 personal protective measures significantly improved in the community transmission phase compared to the early phase.
NA,Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%.
NA,However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%).
NA,Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed, men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households.
NA,The prevalence of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving, however there is potential for improvement, especially in regard to avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth.
NA,To model the effects of continuous, intermittent, and stepping-down social distancing (SD) strategies and personal protection measures on COVID-19 transmission dynamics.
NA,Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %).
NA,The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths.
NA,The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy.
NA,An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window.
NA,However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).
NA,If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
NA,Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
NA,According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.
NA,While SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread rapidly worldwide, data remains scarce about the natural history of infection in pregnant women and the risk of mother-to-fetal transmission.
NA,Current data indicates that viral RNA levels in maternal blood are low and there is no evidence of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Published reports to date suggest that perinatal transmission of SARSCoV- 2 can occur but is rare.
NA,Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM.
NA,However, these cases arise from maternal infection close to childbirth and there are no information about exposition during first or second trimester of pregnancy.
NA,Welldesigned prospective cohort studies with rigorous judgement criteria are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors for perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended.
NA,Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques.
NA,Gynaecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom.
NA,Due to COVID-19 pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom.
NA,In addition there has been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of COVID-19.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> As a result laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration and it is uncertain whether this may impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated.
NA,Although Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected by COVID-19, for the first 2.5 months since its first reported case on January 23, 2020, it remained one of the few nations with successful containment of spread of the pandemic with little mortality and zero intra-hospital transmissions, without instituting a major lockdown of the country.
NA,In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeon's role becomes rather vague.
NA,However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do.
NA,By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe.
NA,Contingencies should be in place for prioritization of existing patients, triaging and treatment of suspected patients, infection control, manpower management and novel strategies for inter-disciplinary communications and education in a hospital's surgical unit during a pandemic.
NA,Working in a high risk environment with manpower and resource limitations for prolonged periods of time has effect on morale and affects surgeon burn-out.
NA,Transparent communication, avenues to address psychological needs of surgeons and leadership by example are key strategies in ensuring a sustainable fight against the pandemic.
NA,With the varies strategies implemented, every surgical discipline and every surgeon should be unified and place their desire to operate aside.
NA,There should not be any differentiation between surgeon and physician, but instead, everyone has to work together as one united health care front battling the common enemy - COVID-19.
NA,Italy is the European country that was hit first and hardest by the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,Since February 2020, the outbreak of the epidemic disease in Italy, with fatal outcomes in up to 10% of cases, made it urgent to implement extraordinary measures to avoid a breakdown of the universal Italian national health system.
NA,The update for April 1, 2020, in Italy recorded 102,669 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with a median patient age of 63 years.
NA,The deceased patients were older people (median age 80 years) and often had a cancer diagnosis (about 20%).
NA,Thus, in the extraordinary epidemiological scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, older persons in cancer treatment are at particularly high risk of being severely affected by COVID-19.
NA,These people face a health- and economics-related emergency that also carries cultural and ethical implications.
NA,In accordance with the measures adopted by the Italian government to limit viral transmission, several associations of Italian oncologists have taken action to update Elderly Cancer Care programs.
NA,In view of the newly emerging needs, we herein outline practical suggestions aimed at guaranteeing the best continuity to elderly cancer patients.
NA,The shelter-in-place order for Santa Clara County, California on 16 March was the first of its kind in the USA.
NA,It was unknown what impact this order would have on trauma activations.
NA,We performed a retrospective analysis of institutional trauma registries among the two American College of Surgeons Level 1 trauma centers serving Santa Clara County, California.
NA,Trauma activation volumes at the trauma centers from January to March 2020 were compared with month-matched historical cohorts from 2018 to 2019.
NA,Only 81 (3%) patients were trauma activations at the trauma centers in the 15 days after the shelter-in-place order went into effect on 16 March 2020, compared with 389 activations during the same time period in 2018 and 2019 (p&lt;0.0001).
NA,There were no other statistically significant changes to the epidemiology of trauma activations.
NA,Only one trauma activation had a positive COVID-19 test.
NA,Overall trauma activations decreased 4.8-fold after the shelter-in-place order went into effect in Santa Clara County on 16 March 2020, with no other effect on the epidemiology of persons presenting after traumatic injury.
NA,Shelter-in-place orders may reduce strain on healthcare systems by diminishing hospital admissions from trauma, in addition to reducing virus transmission.
NA,Social distancing as a technique to limit transmission of infectious disease has come into common parlance following the arrival and rapid spread of a novel coronavirus disease around the world in 2019 and 2020.
NA,But in the face of an emerging pandemic threat, it is crucial that we start to apply these principles to the clinic, the emergency department, and the hospital ward.
NA,We propose that this dynamic situation calls for a parallel &quot;Clinical Distancing&quot; in which we as a medical culture go against many of our fundamental instincts and, at least in the short term, begin to reduce unnecessary patient-care contacts for the benefit of our patients and our ability to continue to provide care to those who need it most.
NA,In this commentary, we provide specific recommendations for the rapid implementation of clinical distancing techniques.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is creating unique strains on the healthcare system.
NA,While only a small percentage of patients require mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the enormous size of the populations affected means that these critical resources may become limited.
NA,A number of non-invasive options exist to avert mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.
NA,This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients.
NA,Summary recommendations include: (1) Avoid nebulized therapies.
NA,Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives.
NA,(2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure.
NA,Maintain awareness of the aerosol-generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks.
NA,Use non-rebreather masks when possible.
NA,Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment.
NA,(3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements.
NA,Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission.
NA,If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation.
NA,(4) Early intubation/mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
NA,Uncertainty around the role 'super-spreaders' play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition.
NA,It is a term that has been much used in relation to COVID-19, particularly in social media.
NA,On its widest definition, it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people.
NA,Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others.
NA,Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings.
NA,This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic.
NA,One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders.
NA,Another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,The author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition.
NA,Understanding the early transmission dynamics of diseases and estimation of the effectiveness of control policies play inevitable roles in the prevention of epidemic diseases.
NA,To this end, this paper is concerned with the design of optimal control strategies for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
NA,A mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on Wuhan's data is considered in this study.
NA,To solve the presented problem effectively and efficiently, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to achieve high-quality schedules for various factors such as contact rate and transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class.
NA,By changing the contact rate and the transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class, two optimal policies are designed.
NA,This study has two main scientific contributions that are: (1) This is pioneer research that proposes policies regarding COVID-19, (2) This is also the first research that addresses COVID-19 and considers its economic consequences through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.
NA,Numerical simulations conspicuously demonstrate that by applying optimal policies, governments could find useful and practical ways for control of the disease.
NA,It has been confirmed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can transmit through droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes.
NA,Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans.
NA,This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people.
NA,However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient.
NA,To provide evidence and insight into the &quot;social distancing&quot; guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs.
NA,Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 μm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze.
NA,The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed.
NA,Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%.
NA,The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet).
NA,The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated.
NA,Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans.
NA,Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance.
NA,The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people.
NA,High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground.
NA,With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s.
NA,Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered.
NA,Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.
NA,The first Hungarian COVID-19 case was reported on March 4, 2020 by Hungarian officials.
NA,Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with 12% of total coronavirus cases confirmed among them recently. 80% of the infected persons show only mild, moderate symptoms or stay asymptomatic.
NA,The single-stranded viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR from the respiratory tract, urine, blood and, particulary in children, from stool samples for 30-40 days.
NA,We have no valid data of how many HCWs have been infected since the Hungarian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, due to the lack of the systematic screening.
NA,HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members.
NA,Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., &quot;already protected&quot;, the ones in the acute phase, i.e., &quot;the infectious&quot;, and the virus-naive, i.e., &quot;at risk&quot; workers.
NA,Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,Orv Hetil.
NA,2020; 161(21): 854-860.
NA,As states begin issuing progressive deconfinement guidelines, hospitals and institutions are starting to reopen for elective procedures and consultations.
NA,Vestibular clinicians are opening their practices to evaluate, test or treat patients with dizziness and balance problems.
NA,The following document, requested by the American Balance Society, collates the current information about the virus, including transmission from asymptomatic carriers, decontamination and other safety protocols, and provides a return to work guidance for clinicians caring for this population of patients, promoting provider, patient and staff safety.
NA,There is limited evidence of work-related transmission in the emerging coronaviral pandemic.
NA,We aimed to identify high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) local transmission.
NA,In this observational study, we extracted confirmed COVID-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.
NA,We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases.
NA,We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver).
NA,We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases.
NA,The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period).
NA,We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions.
NA,The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%).
NA,Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases).
NA,Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals).
NA,Work-related transmission is considerable in early COVID-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW.
NA,Implementing preventive/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.
NA,In less than four months, an unprecedented pandemic changed the world scenario, closing institutions and commerce, paralyzing sports championships, blocking frontiers, and putting almost all populations in a house quarantine regimen.
NA,Immunocompromised patients are within the high-risk group to severe outcomes from COVID-19.
NA,However, there is no clear evidence of the association between impaired immune host status and complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection so far.
NA,The virus is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, and therefore the dental office is a highly susceptible environment for such transmission.
NA,Here, we review the literature and discuss immunological COVID-19 related issues.
NA,We also make suggestions for immunocompromised patients' support in this new emerging context of clinical dental practice.
NA,Until comprehensive findings are published, individuals with impaired immunity should be considered as high-risk.
NA,Cross infection control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for immunocompetent ones.
NA,However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room.
NA,In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects.
NA,Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice.
NA,However, they still need to be validated by future studies.
NA,This article presents expert recommendations for assisting newborn children of mothers with suspected or diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 &lt;/mac_aq&gt;(COVID-19).
NA,The consensus was developed by five experts with an average of 20 years of experience in neonatal intensive care working at a reference university hospital in Brazil for the care of pregnant women and newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
NA,Despite the lack of scientific evidence regarding the potential for viral transmission to their fetus in pregnant mothers diagnosed with or suspected of COVID-19, it is important to elaborate the lines of care by specialists from hospitals caring for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to guide multidisciplinary teams and families diagnosed with the disease or involved in the care of pregnant women and newborns in this context.
NA,Multidisciplinary teams must be attentive to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 so that decision-making is oriented and assertive for the management of the mother and newborn in both the hospital setting and at hospital discharge.
NA,Controlling infections during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (GI endoscopy) and ERCP is important to prevent the transmission of infection among and through medical staff.
NA,The infection, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is transmitted by inhalation, contact with infected droplets, or possibly infectious aerosol.
NA,On March 11<sup>th</sup> 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
NA,Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission.
NA,It is now clear that the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is aerosol/droplet spread, and by contacting virus contaminated surfaces acting as fomites (inanimate vectors).
NA,Furthermore, recent data indicate that the live virus particles are present in saliva, and, more alarmingly, asymptomatic individuals may transmit the infection.
NA,By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols are produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management.
NA,Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa.
NA,This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID-19, in the post-pandemic era.
NA,To describe and discuss a systematic method for producing a very rapid response (3 days) to a UK government policy question in the context of reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,A group of behavioural and social scientists advising the UK government on COVID-19 contributed to the analysis and writing of advice through the Government Office for Science.
NA,The question was as follows: What are the options for increasing adherence to social distancing (staying at home except for essential journeys and work) and shielding vulnerable people (keeping them at home and away from others)?
NA,This was prior to social distancing legislation being implemented.
NA,The first two authors produced a draft, based on analysis of the current government guidance and the application of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework to identify and evaluate the options.
NA,For promoting social distancing, 10 options were identified for improving adherence.
NA,They covered improvements in ways of achieving the BCW intervention types of education, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion.
NA,For promoting shielding of vulnerable people, four options were identified covering the BCW intervention types of incentivization, coercion, and enablement.
NA,Responding to policymakers very rapidly as has been necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by using a framework to structure the thinking and reporting of multidisciplinary academics and policymakers.
NA,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Canadian provinces have gone through four distinct phases of social distancing and enhanced testing.
NA,A transmission dynamics model fitted to the cumulative case time series data permits us to estimate the effectiveness of interventions implemented in terms of the contact rate, probability of transmission per contact, proportion of isolated contacts, and detection rate.
NA,This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one).
NA,From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound.
NA,From this, we quantify the conditions needed to prevent epidemic rebound during de-escalation by simply reversing the escalation process.
NA,<b>Background:</b> The new SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China is spreading rapidly worldwide.
NA,A number of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women have been reported.
NA,However, more information is still needed on the pregnancy outcome and the neonates regarding COVID-19 pneumonia.<b>Material and Methods:</b> A systematic search was done and nine articles on COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women were extracted.
NA,Some maternal-fetal characteristics were extracted to be included in the meta-analysis<b>.</b><b>Results:</b> The present meta-analysis was conducted on 87 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women.
NA,Almost 65% of the patients reported a history of exposure to an infected person, 78% suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19, 99.9% had successful termination, 86% had cough, and 68% had fever (<i>p</i> = .022 and <i>p</i> &lt; .001).
NA,The overall proportions of vertical transmission, still birth, and neonatal death were zero, 0.002, and, 0.002, respectively (<i>p</i> = 1, <i>p</i> = .86, and <i>p</i> = .89, respectively).
NA,The means of the first- and fifth-minute Apgar scores were 8.86 and 9, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; .001 for both).
NA,The confounding role of history of underlying diseases with an estimated overall proportion of 33% (<i>p</i> = .03) resulted in further investigations due to sample size limitation.
NA,A natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia in the adult population was presented, as well.<b>Conclusion:</b> Currently, no evidence of vertical transmission has been suggested at least in late pregnancy.
NA,No hazards have been detected for fetuses or neonates.
NA,Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.
NA,To date, non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) have been the mainstay for controlling the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,While NPIs are effective in preventing health systems overload, these long-term measures are likely to have significant adverse economic consequences.
NA,Therefore, many countries are currently considering to lift the NPIs-increasing the likelihood of disease resurgence.
NA,In this regard, dynamic NPIs, with intervals of relaxed social distancing, may provide a more suitable alternative.
NA,However, the ideal frequency and duration of intermittent NPIs, and the ideal &quot;break&quot; when interventions can be temporarily relaxed, remain uncertain, especially in resource-poor settings.
NA,We employed a multivariate prediction model, based on up-to-date transmission and clinical parameters, to simulate outbreak trajectories in 16 countries, from diverse regions and economic categories.
NA,In each country, we then modelled the impacts on intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths over an 18-month period for following scenarios: (1) no intervention, (2) consecutive cycles of mitigation measures followed by a relaxation period, and (3) consecutive cycles of suppression measures followed by a relaxation period.
NA,We defined these dynamic interventions based on reduction of the mean reproduction number during each cycle, assuming a basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) of 2.2 for no intervention, and subsequent effective reproduction numbers (R) of 0.8 and 0.5 for illustrative dynamic mitigation and suppression interventions, respectively.
NA,We found that dynamic cycles of 50-day mitigation followed by a 30-day relaxation reduced transmission, however, were unsuccessful in lowering ICU hospitalizations below manageable limits.
NA,By contrast, dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation kept the ICU demands below the national capacities.
NA,Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period.
NA,This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control.
NA,Such a &quot;schedule&quot; of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable.
NA,Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.
NA,To evaluate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes by performing a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19.
NA,We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes.
NA,We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until 20 April 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after that date).
NA,For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery.
NA,Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient being pregnant on admission and availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcome.
NA,Exclusion criteria were non-peer-reviewed or unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study, suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes.
NA,No language restrictions were applied.
NA,We identified a high number of relevant case reports and case series, but only 24 studies, including a total of 324 pregnant women with COVID-19, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review.
NA,These comprised nine case series (eight consecutive) and 15 case reports.
NA,A total of 20 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the case reports.
NA,In the combined data from the eight consecutive case series, including 211 (71.5%) cases of laboratory-confirmed and 84 (28.5%) of clinically diagnosed COVID-19, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 44 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks.
NA,The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath, fatigue and myalgia.
NA,The rate of severe pneumonia reported amongst the case series ranged from 0 to 14%, with the majority of the cases requiring admission to the intensive care unit.
NA,Almost all cases from the case series had positive computer tomography chest findings.
NA,All six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, were negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Only four cases of spontaneous miscarriage or abortion were reported.
NA,In the consecutive case series, 219/295 women had delivered at the time of reporting, and the majority of these had Cesarean section.
NA,The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks.
NA,Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min ranged from 7 to 10 and 7 to 10, respectively.
NA,Only eight neonates had birth weight &lt;2500 g and nearly one-third of cases were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit.
NA,There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death.
NA,In 155 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, all, except three cases, were negative for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,There were seven maternal deaths, four intrauterine fetal deaths (one with twin pregnancy) and two neonatal deaths (twin pregnancy) reported in a non-consecutive case series of nine cases with severe COVID-19.
NA,From the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported.
NA,Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good-quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID-19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications.
NA,In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses through meaningful good-quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into a registry or several registries.

NA,Many countries have closed schools and kindergartens to minimise COVID-19, but the role that children play in disease transmission is unclear.
NA,A systematic literature review of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and medRxiv/bioRxiv preprint servers to 11 May 2020 identified published and unpublished papers on COVID-19 transmission by children.
NA,We identified 700 scientific papers and letters and 47 full texts were studied in detail.
NA,Children accounted for a small fraction of COVID-19 cases and mostly had social contacts with peers or parents, rather than older people at risk of severe disease.
NA,Data on viral loads were scarce, but indicated that children may have lower levels than adults, partly because they often have fewer symptoms, and this should decrease the transmission risk.
NA,Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks.
NA,However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.
NA,Children are unlikely to be the main drivers of the pandemic.
NA,Opening up schools and kindergartens is unlikely to impact COVID-19 mortality rates in older people.
NA,The virologically confirmed cases of a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the world are rapidly increasing, leading epidemiologists and mathematicians to construct transmission models that aim to predict the future course of the current pandemic.
NA,The transmissibility of a virus is measured by the basic reproduction number ( R<sub>0</sub> ), which measures the average number of new cases generated per typical infectious case.
NA,This review highlights the articles reporting rigorous estimates and determinants of COVID-19 R<sub>0</sub> for the most affected areas.
NA,Moreover, the mean of all estimated R<sub>0</sub> with median and interquartile range is calculated.
NA,According to these articles, the basic reproduction number of the virus epicentre Wuhan has now declined below the important threshold value of 1.0 since the disease emerged.
NA,Ongoing modelling will inform the transmission rates seen in the new epicentres outside of China, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.
NA,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide evolving into a pandemic, poses a global health emergency.
NA,As of mid-April over 2 million people have been infected with over 145 thousand casualties.
NA,The disease is more severe in the older population, whereas in children lower infection rates and milder symptoms are more common.
NA,Severe symptoms in the pediatric population, although uncommon, have been reported mainly in infants younger than 1 year of age.
NA,Perinatal transmission is infrequent and associated with a relatively mild illness in the newborn.
NA,In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the more routine public health measures, many countries have implemented &quot;lockdowns&quot;-closing borders, restricting international travel, and placing severe limitations on individual movement and group gatherings.
NA,While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases.
NA,Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries.
NA,Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to &quot;unlock&quot; or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. &quot;Precision physical distancing&quot;-distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings-is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19.
NA,It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures.
NA,Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic places healthcare workers at risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation.
NA,A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The materials and assembly process of the novel &quot;Corona Curtain&quot; are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities.
NA,A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct.
NA,The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source.
NA,The new &quot;Corona Curtain&quot; was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units.
NA,Future validation studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the intubation tents by quantifying the pre-/post-intubation exposure through &quot;point-of-care&quot; SARS-CoV-2 testing once these resources are more widely available.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global pandemic affecting 213 countries as of April 26, 2020.
NA,Although this disease is affecting all age groups, infants and children seem to be at a lower risk of severe infection, for reasons unknown at this time.
NA,We report a case of neonatal infection in New York, United States, and provide a review of the published cases.
NA,A 22-day-old, previously healthy, full-term neonate was hospitalized after presenting with a one-day history of fever and poor feeding.
NA,Routine neonatal sepsis evaluation was negative.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was obtained, given rampant community transmission, which returned positive.
NA,There were no other laboratory or radiographic abnormalities.
NA,The infant recovered completely and was discharged home in two days once his feeding improved.
NA,The family was advised to self-quarantine to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
NA,We believe that the mode of transmission was horizontal spread from his caregivers.
NA,This case highlights the milder presentation of COVID-19 in otherwise healthy, full-term neonates.
NA,COVID-19 must be considered in the evaluation of a febrile infant.
NA,Infants and children may play an important role in the transmission of COVID-19 in the community.
NA,Hence, with an understanding of the transmission patterns, parents and caregivers would be better equipped to limit the spread of the virus and protect the more vulnerable population.
NA,From two COVID-19-related deaths, samples of lung, heart and kidney were collected and processed for Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy (TEM and SEM) with the aim of identifying the virus.
NA,Virions of SARS-CoV-2 were found in all tissues by TEM and SEM, corroborating the hypothesis that the virus enters the cells of different organs.
NA,This is the first report identifying SARS-CoV-2 in different human tissues by TEM and SEM.
NA,The current global pandemic of COVID-19 due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is causing considerable loss of life and enormous social and economic disruption.
NA,Here, we describe the response of the blood service, the impact on blood donation and the effects on the blood supply in Hong Kong posed by the earlier SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003.
NA,The infection, like SARS-CoV-2 was highly contagious through droplet transmission.
NA,In the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, donor and staff safety was secured by using stringent infection control measures to protect both donors and staff from contacting the virus.
NA,All the donors were requested to wear face masks within the donation venue and use an alcohol-based hand rinse.
NA,The donors' body temperature was checked before donation and staff's body temperatures were checked daily.
NA,The safety of the blood supply was secured by a donor deferral policy for 4 weeks following contact with a confirmed or suspected case of and a post-donation call-back system.
NA,Despite scheduling mobile donation sessions and a decrease in donors attending blood donor centers, the blood supply was maintained as there was a 12.8% reduction of the demand of blood and only a 16.9% reduction in the blood donation.
NA,Lessons learnt during the epidemic may help preparation for future epidemics and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis and role of coronaviruses in transfusion medicine.
NA,These are continuing problems as coronavirus epidemics may recur with future impact on blood collection and blood donation screening.

NA,The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) continues to expand worldwide.
NA,Although the number of cases and the death rate among children and adolescents are reported to be low compared to adults, limited data have been reported.
NA,We urgently need to find treatment and vaccine to stop the epidemic.
NA,Vaccine development is in progress, but any approved and effective vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 12 to 18 months.
NA,The World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have issued instructions and strategies for containing COVID-19 outbreak to the general public, physicians, travelers and injured patients to follow so that the transmission to a healthy population can be prevented.
NA,In this review, we summarize demographic data, clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes and finally prevention and control of this serious pandemic.
NA,Since human coronavirus (HCoV)-like particles were detected in the stool specimens of acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing enterocolitis children with electron microscopy, the relationship between HCoV and the pediatric gastrointestinal illness had been recognized.
NA,In recent years, the overall detection rates have been low and have varied by region.
NA,HCoVs have not been considered as the major pathogens in pediatric acute gastroenteritis.
NA,HCoVs detected in children with acute gastroenteritis have included 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in children.
NA,Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases.
NA,Furthermore, pathological features have not been clear.
NA,Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited.
NA,However, diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases, particularly in newborns and infants.
NA,It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.
NA,Our objective was to review the literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and propose mitigation measures to address these risks.
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused surgeons the world over to re-evaluate their approach to surgical procedures given concerns over the risk of aerosolization of viral particles and exposure of operating room staff to infection.
NA,International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action.
NA,We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches.
NA,We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution.
NA,While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case.
NA,A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large.
NA,Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.
NA,In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conduct of elective cancer surgery has become an issue because of the need to balance the requirement to treat patients with the possibility of transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers.
NA,A particular concern is the potential for viral transmission by way of aerosol which may be generated during perioperative care.
NA,There are currently no guidelines for the conduct of elective lung resection surgery in this context.
NA,A working group composed of 1 thoracic surgeon, 2 anesthesiologists and 1 critical care specialist assessed the risk for aerosol during lung resection surgery and proposed steps for mitigation.
NA,After external review, a final draft was approved by the Committee for the Governance of Perioperative and Surgical Activities of the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, in Montreal, Canada.
NA,The working group divided the risk for aerosol into 6 time-points: (1) intubation and extubation; (2) Lung isolation and patient positioning; (3) access to the chest; (4) conduct of the surgical procedure; (5) procedure termination and lung re-expansion; (6) chest drainage.
NA,Mitigating strategies were proposed for each time-point.
NA,The situation with COVID-19 is an opportunity to re-evaluate operating room protocols both for the purposes of this pandemic and similar situations in the future.
NA,In the context of lung resection surgery, specific time points during the procedure seem to pose specific risks for the genesis of aerosol and thus should be the focus of attention.
NA,A novel infectious disease, Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19), spread globally since Dec.
NA,2019.
NA,Without effective treatment and vaccination, the strategies to restrain this disease is only keeping social distance, maintaining personal hygiene, quarantine and isolation.
NA,However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients.
NA,In addition to the high risk of cluster infection and compromised immunity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), an atypical disease presentation could also make the medial system neglect these patients during CVOID-19 pandemic.
NA,To avoid COVID-19 transmission among dialysis patients, the major societies of nephrology around the world have provided their guidelines of screening, dialysis facilities adjustment, and health education, respectively.
NA,In this review, we summarized the main contents and difference of these guidelines and addressed the prompt management for ESRD patients to reduce the risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Since the first cases in Wuhan, China, during the month of December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) evolved into a worldwide emergency, becoming one of the deadliest pandemics of modern history.
NA,As we write, the outbreak has led to 3,595,662 confirmed cases and 247,652 deaths worldwide<sup>1</sup> .
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the disease, is a single-stranded RNA virus which can cause a wide clinical spectrum of symptoms.
NA,According to the available knowledge, a large but still unknown percentage of the infected patients remains asymptomatic, representing an important and insidious vehicle of transmission<sup>2</sup> .
NA,According to the largest case series to date, most of the symptomatic patients complain of a mild respiratory syndrome (81%), while approximately 14% develop a severe disease requiring hospitalization and a further 5% need intensive care<sup>3</sup> .
NA,In March 2020, a wedding in Jordan led to a large outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,We collected data on 350 wedding attendees, 76 who of whom developed COVID-19.
NA,Our study shows high communicability of COVID-19 and the enormous risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 virus transmission during mass gatherings.
NA,In order to benefit the public, community workers and scientific community, we hereby present a chronicle of SARS-CoV-2 that leads to the unseen precedent of social distancing and lockdown owing to coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic.
NA,Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
NA,We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses.
NA,The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management.
NA,We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.
NA,We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and scope.
NA,In the absence of a cure in the time of a pandemic, social distancing measures seem to be the most effective intervention to slow the spread of disease.
NA,Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures.
NA,While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections.
NA,This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters.
NA,However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing.
NA,The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks.
NA,Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (β) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks.
NA,Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and β values.
NA,Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates.
NA,Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
NA,In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.
NA,As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreads globally, hospitals are rushing to adapt their facilities which may not have been designed to deal with infections adequately.
NA,We present the management of a patient with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia.
NA,A 66-years-old man presented to the hospital and his recent travel history, infective symptoms and CXR made him a possible COVID-19 suspect.
NA,Emergency surgery was decided considering the septic condition.
NA,The patient was transported to operating theatre with supplemental oxygen over a face mask and plastic covering over the trolley.
NA,Rapid sequence intubation was performed by an experienced anesthetist using a videolaryngoscope.
NA,After surgery, the patient remained intubated to avoid re-intubation due to initial presentation of respiratory distress.
NA,Droplet, contact and airborne infection precautions were instituted.
NA,Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimising risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.
NA,By the end of 2019 the first cases of severe pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China.
NA,The causative agent was identified as a novel b-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named COVID-19.
NA,Since the beginning of 2020, the infection has spread worldwide, which led the WHO to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern and to characterize the current situation as a pandemic.
NA,The transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days.
NA,Most cases are mild, but some patients develop severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress, septic shock and multi-organ failure.
NA,The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath.
NA,Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found.
NA,Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes.
NA,The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities.
NA,Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.
NA,The current ongoing pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has globally affected 213 countries and territories with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases and thousands of casualties.
NA,The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level.
NA,Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.
NA,This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans.
NA,Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed.
NA,COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world.
NA,Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
NA,Management of the high rates of medical and psychiatric complications, including self-harm and suicide, associated with Anorexia Nervosa require regular clinical review.
NA,However, during the current pandemic, face to face clinical assessments carry the risk of infection and transmission in this vulnerable cohort already compromised by low weight and lowered immunity.
NA,This paper describes how one service has had to adapt usual care during the COVID-19 pandemic without contributing excessively to carer burden or compromising patient safety.
NA,Currently, there are four seasonal coronaviruses associated with relatively mild respiratory tract disease in humans.
NA,However, there are also a plethora of animal coronaviruses, which have the potential to cross the species border.
NA,This regularly results in the emergence of new viruses in humans.
NA,In 2002 SARS-CoV emerged, to rapidly disappear in May 2003.
NA,In 2012 MERS-CoV was identified as a possible threat to humans, but its pandemic potential so far is minimal, as the human-to-human transmission is ineffective.
NA,The end of 2019 brought us information about the SARS-CoV-2 emergence, and the virus rapidly spread in 2020 causing an unprecedented pandemic.At present, the studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line.
NA,This model is convenient for diagnostics, but it has serious limitations and does not allow for the understanding of virus biology and evolution.Here we show that fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures constitute an excellent model to study the infection with the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We observed an efficient replication of the virus in the tissue, with the maximal replication at 2 days post-infection.
NA,The virus replicated in ciliated cells and was released apically.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020.
NA,At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds.
NA,While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells.
NA,Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Despite lacking capacity and resources, the health system in the northwest Syria is using innovative approaches for the containment of COVID-19.
NA,Lessons drawn from previous outbreaks in the region, such as the polio outbreak in 2013 and the annual seasonal influenza, have enabled the Early Warning and Response Network, a surveillance system to develop mechanisms of predicting risk and strengthening surveillance for the new pandemic.
NA,Social media tools such as WhatsApp are effectively collecting health information and communicating health messaging about COVID-19.
NA,Community engagement has also been scaled up, mobilizing local resources and encouraging thousands of volunteers to join the 'Volunteers against Corona' campaign.
NA,Bottom-up local governance technical entities, such as Idleb Health Directorate and the White Helmets, have played key leadership role in the response.
NA,These efforts need to be scaled up to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in a region chronically affected by a complex armed conflict.
NA,An ongoing apocalyptic outbreak of a new virus causing pneumonia-like clusters in Wuhan city, China, has gleamed the world.
NA,The outbreak, confirmed on the New Year's Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then.
NA,The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating.
NA,Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
NA,Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission.
NA,The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called 'super-spreading events' emerge with time.
NA,Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host.
NA,India is responding swiftly to the emergency situation, and the whole of the country is under lockdown since 25 March 2020, to ensure social distancing.
NA,All the international flights are padlocked and the travellers are being screened at airports and seaports via thermal sensors, and quarantine for a period of 14 days is recommended.
NA,Three hundred and forty-five patients across the country tested positive with six fatalities as of 22 March 2020.
NA,No specific anti-CoV drugs are currently available.
NA,Patients are being treated with protease drugs are inhibitors, remdesivir, chloroquine, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors, ivermectin, sarilumab and tocilizumab, though none of these is Food and Drug Administration approved and are undergoing trials.
NA,Preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, cough etiquettes, proper hand washing, cleaning and decontaminating the surfaces are the mainstay for curbing the transmission of this virus.
NA,The present review highlights the update of novel SARS-CoV-2 in context to the Indian scenario.
NA,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, a series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
NA,We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of all confirmed cases in Qinghai, a province at high altitude.
NA,The region had no sustained local transmission.
NA,Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising 4 transmission clusters were identified.
NA,Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan.
NA,Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 2 patients showed no abnormalities.
NA,Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases or diabetes developed severe illness.
NA,High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both ALT and AST were observed in 3 severely ill patients on admission.
NA,All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies.
NA,Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters.
NA,Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness.

NA,An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,Characterization of the histopathology and cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissues of patients with fatal COVID-19 is critical to further understand its pathogenesis and transmission and for public health prevention measures.
NA,We report clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic findings in tissues from 8 fatal laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States.
NA,All cases except 1 were in residents of long-term care facilities.
NA,In these patients, SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelium of the upper and lower airways with diffuse alveolar damage as the predominant pulmonary pathology.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was detectable by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in conducting airways, pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and a hilar lymph node but was not identified in other extrapulmonary tissues.
NA,Respiratory viral co-infections were identified in 3 cases; 3 cases had evidence of bacterial co-infection.
NA,On March 16, 2020, the day that national social distancing guidelines were released (1), the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) was notified of two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a rural county of approximately 25,000 persons; these cases were the first identified in this county.
NA,The two cases occurred in a husband and wife; the husband is the pastor at a local church (church A).
NA,The couple (the index cases) attended church-related events during March 6-8, and developed nonspecific respiratory symptoms and fever on March 10 (wife) and 11 (husband).
NA,Before his symptoms had developed, the husband attended a Bible study group on March 11.
NA,Including the index cases, 35 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred among 92 (38%) persons who attended events held at church A during March 6-11; three patients died.
NA,The age-specific attack rates among persons aged ≤18 years, 19-64 years, and ≥65 years were 6.3%, 59.4%, and 50.0%, respectively.
NA,During contact tracing, at least 26 additional persons with confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among community members who reported contact with church A attendees and likely were infected by them; one of the additional persons was hospitalized and subsequently died.
NA,This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, both at group gatherings during church events and within the broader community.
NA,These findings underscore the opportunity for faith-based organizations to prevent COVID-19 by following local authorities' guidance and the U.S.
NA,Government's Guidelines: Opening Up America Again (2) regarding modification of activities to prevent virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Novel-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern, as avowed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
NA,Ethiopia has become one of the affected countries as of March 15, 2020.
NA,This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and practices among the Jimma University medical center (JUMC) visitors in Jimma town.
NA,A cross-sectional study was conducted on 247 sampled visitors, from 20-24 March 2020.
NA,Consecutive sampling was used to recruit the participants.
NA,The study tools were adapted from WHO resources.
NA,The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0.
NA,Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of knowledge, perception, and practices.
NA,Logistic regression was executed to assess the predictors of dominant preventive practices.
NA,Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19.
NA,72.0% knew that older people who have chronic illnesses are at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19.
NA,About 95.1% knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected people, while 77 (31.2%) of the respondents knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission.
NA,Only 15 (6.1%) knew that children and young adults had to involve preventive measures.
NA,Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge.
NA,The majority, 170(68.8%), felt self-efficacious to controlling COVID-19.
NA,207(83.3%) believed that COVID-19 is a stigmatized disease.
NA,Frequent hand washing (77.3%) and avoidance of shaking hands (53.8%) were the dominant practices.
NA,Knowledge status and self-efficacy (positively), older age, and unemployment (negatively) predicted hand washing and avoidance of handshaking.
NA,The status of knowledge and desirable practices were not sufficient enough to combat this rapidly spreading virus.
NA,COVID-19 risk communication and public education efforts should focus on building an appropriate level of knowledge while enhancing the adoption of recommended self-care practices with special emphasis on high-risk audience segments.
NA,The ongoing outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a challenge for worldwide public health.
NA,A reliable laboratory assay is essential both to confirm suspected patients and to exclude patients infected with other respiratory viruses, thereby facilitating the control of global outbreak scenarios.
NA,In this review, we focus on the genomic, transmission and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We also explore the quality assurance measures for these assays.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects, including the design of primers, the selection of specimens and testing strategies at different disease stages.
NA,Appropriate quality assurance measures for molecular and serological assays are needed to maintain testing proficiency.
NA,Because serological assays have the potential to identify later stages of the infection and to confirm highly suspected cases with negative molecular assay results, a combination of these two assays is needed to achieve a reliable capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2.
NA,On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with &quot;human-to-human&quot; transmission was officially announced by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China.
NA,Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventative mental health strategies.
NA,Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The aim of the present study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China.
NA,A multi-center cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
NA,This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 epidemic.
NA,A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1 to February 9, 2020.
NA,Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020 when the coronavirus epidemic was publically announced and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point.
NA,The internationally recommended EPDS was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.
NA,Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre and post study groups.
NA,Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of COVID-19 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=0.02) than women assess pre-epidemic announcement.
NA,These women were also more likely to endorse thoughts of self-harm (P=0.005).
NA,The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases (P=0.003), suspected infections (P=0.004), and death cases per day (P=0.001).
NA,Pregnant women who were underweight pre-pregnancy, primiparous, &lt; 35 years old, employed full-time, middle income, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk to develop depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.
NA,Major life-threatening public health events such as the COVID-19 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women including thoughts of self-harm.
NA,Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.
NA,The ongoing wreaking global outbreak of the novel human beta coronavirus (CoV) pathogen was presumed to be from a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, belongs to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovirales order.
NA,The virus is highly contagious with potential human-human transmission which was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across six continents and emerged as a global pandemic in short span with alarming levels of spread and severity.
NA,This virus associated symptoms and infectious respiratory illness is designated as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 possesses enveloped club-like spike protein projections with positive-sense large RNA genome and has a unique replication strategy.
NA,This virus was believed to have zoonotic origin with genetical identity to bat and pangolin CoV.
NA,In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity.
NA,Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options.
NA,Also we have summarized the latest research progress on the usage of stem cell therapy, human convalescent serum, interferon's, in the treatment of COVID-19.
NA,A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) questionnaire was used to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19.
NA,Findings showed HCPs had good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (8.43±1.78) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) regarding COVID-19.
NA,HCPs perceived that limited infection control material (50.7%, n=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, n=168) are the major barriers in infection control practice.
NA,Regression analysis indicated pharmacist role (OR: 2.247, 95% CI: 1.11-4.55, P=0.025) was the substantial determinant of good practice.
NA,HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, yet, there were areas where gaps in knowledge and practice were observed.
NA,COVID-19 disease is becoming a global pandemic and more than 200 countries were affected because of this disease.
NA,Italy is one of the countries is largely suffered with this virus outbreak, and about 180,000 cases (as of 20 April 2020) were registered which explains the large transmissibility and reproduction case numbers.
NA,In this study, we considered the Marche region of Italy to compute different daily transmission rates (R<sub>t</sub>) including five provinces in it.
NA,We also present forecasting of daily and cumulative incidences associated after the next thirty days.
NA,The Marche region is the 8th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy.
NA,Epidemic statistics were extracted from the national Italian Health Ministry website.
NA,We considered outbreak information where the first case registered in Marche with onset symptoms (26 February 2020) to the present date (20 April 2020).
NA,Adoption of incidence and projections with R statistics was done.
NA,The median values of R<sub>t</sub> for the five provinces of Pesaro and Urbano, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli Piceno, and Macerata, was 2.492 (1.1-4.5), 2.162 (1.0-4.0), 1.512 (0.75-2.75), 1.141 (1.0-1.6), and 1.792 (1.0-3.5) with 95% of CI achieved.
NA,The projections at end of 30th day of the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) could be possible.
NA,This study highlights the knowledge of essential insights into the Marche region in particular to virus transmission dynamics, geographical characteristics of positive incidences, and the necessity of implementing mitigation procedures to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Data are limited on the viral load, viral shedding patterns, and potential infectivity of asymptomatic patients (APs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission.
NA,Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs).
NA,The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of APs (39.0, interquartile range (IQR) 37.5-39.5) was significantly higher than that of APIs (34.5, IQR 32.2-37.0), indicating a lower viral load in APs.
NA,However, the duration of viral shedding remained similar in the two groups (7 days, IQR 5-14 days vs. 8 days, IQR 5-16 days).
NA,The study findings demonstrated that although APs with COVID-19 have a lower viral load, they still have certain period of viral shedding, which suggests the possibility of transmission during their asymptomatic period.
NA,Further longitudinal surveillance of these asymptomatic cases via virus nucleic acid testing are warranted.
NA,COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
NA,Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important.
NA,Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection.
NA,We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19.
NA,A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed.
NA,The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria.
NA,We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
NA,The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care.
NA,Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, OR: 7.36 (1.63-33.14; p = 0.021).
NA,This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19.
NA,Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19.
NA,This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group - obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group.
NA,The novel Coronavirus 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has surprised health authorities around the world, quickly producing a global health crisis.
NA,Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
NA,In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat.
NA,In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications.
NA,Low-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries.
NA,Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses.
NA,In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance, but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited.
NA,Our objective was to estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1,062 locations from 1990 to 2019.
NA,Despite overall improvements from 1990 {33.6% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 31.5, 35.6] without access} to 2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (95% UI: 1.91, 2.14) billion people, 26.1% (95% UI: 24.7, 27.7) of the global population, lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water.
NA,More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, and in eight countries, <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>50</mml:mn> <mml:mtext> million</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> or more persons lacked access.
NA,For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, and disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7200.
NA,Quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, early treat, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria.
NA,To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR.
NA,We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from 77 clinical throat swabs, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey.
NA,According to our study, 26 samples from COVID-19 patients with negative RT-PCR reports were detected as positive by ddPCR.
NA,The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18) and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively.
NA,Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR, which still carry detectable SARS-CoV-2 at 5-12 days post discharge.
NA,Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.
NA,Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 10 May 2020: notifications = 6,971; deaths = 98.
NA,The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March.
NA,The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community.
NA,Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate.
NA,Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive.
NA,These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission.
NA,It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings.
NA,In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel.
NA,Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster.
NA,Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease.
NA,The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%).
NA,The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia.
NA,Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years.
NA,The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships.
NA,The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports.
NA,Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases.
NA,Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.
NA,Liver transplantation is considered the ultimate solution for patients with end-stage chronic liver disease or acute liver failure.
NA,Patients with liver transplant need special care starting from preoperative preparation, surgical intervention ending with postoperative care.
NA,Transplanted patients have to receive immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection.
NA,Such a state of immune suppression could predispose to different types of infections in liver transplant recipients.
NA,Currently, the world is suffering a pandemic caused by a new strain of the coronavirus family called COVID-19.
NA,Certain infection control precautions are needed to protect immunocompromised and vulnerable patients, including liver transplant candidates and recipients from acquiring COVID-19 infection.
NA,Restricting non-transplant elective surgical procedures, managing transplant patients in separate outpatient clinics, and in-patient wards can prevent transmission of infection both to patients and healthcare workers.
NA,Telemedicine can help in the triage of patients to screen for symptoms of COVID-19 before their regular appointment.
NA,Management of immunosuppressive therapy and drug-drug interactions in liver transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be cautiously practiced to prevent rejection and effectively treat the underlying infection.
NA,In this report, we are trying to summarize available evidence about different aspects of the management of liver transplant candidates and recipients in the era of COVID-19.
NA,The emergence and fast spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) threatens the world as a new public health crisis.
NA,This study aimed to clarify the impact of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on pregnant patients and maternal and neonatal outcomes.
NA,A comprehensive literature search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Science Direct.
NA,All studies including original data; case reports, case series, descriptive and observational studies, and randomized controlled trials were searched from December 2019 until 19 March 2020.
NA,The search identified 1472 results and 939 abstracts were screened. 928 articles were excluded because studies did not include pregnant women.
NA,Full texts of eleven relevant studies were reviewed and finally nine studies were included in this study.
NA,The characteristics of 89 pregnant women and their neonates were studied.
NA,Results revealed that low-grade fever and cough were the principal symptoms in all patients.
NA,The main reported laboratory findings were lymphopenia, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Amino alanine transferase (ALT), and Aspartate amino transferase (AST).
NA,In all symptomatic cases, chest Computerized Tomography (CT) scans were abnormal.
NA,Fetal distress, premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor were the main prenatal complications.
NA,Two women needed intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation, one of whom developed multi-organ dysfunction and was on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).
NA,No case of maternal death was reported up to the time the studies were published. 79 mothers delivered their babies by cesarean section and five women had a vaginal delivery.
NA,No fetal infection through intrauterine vertical transmission was reported.
NA,Available data showed that pregnant patients in late pregnancy had clinical manifestations similar to non-pregnant adults.
NA,It appears that the risk of fetal distress, preterm delivery and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) rises with the onset of COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy.
NA,There is also no evidence of intrauterine and transplacental transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancies.
NA,Older adults residing in long-term care facilities are especially vulnerable for severe illness or death from COVID-19.
NA,To contain the transmission of the virus in long-term care facilities, federal health officials have issued strict visitation guidelines, restricting most visits between residents and all visitors, including family members.
NA,Yet, many older adults rely on family care for social support and to maintain their health, well-being, and safety in long-term care facilities, and therefore need to stay connected to their families.
NA,The federal government, state and local leaders, and long-term care facilities should take further actions to enable the relationship between residents of long-term care facilities and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The aim of this study is to report our clinical experience in the management of pregnant women infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first thirty days of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from March 14<sup>th</sup> to April 14<sup>th</sup> , 2020.
NA,Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected.
NA,An analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed to compare the medians of laboratory parameters.
NA,Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables.
NA,A correspondence analysis was used to explore associations between variables.
NA,A total of 60 pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19.
NA,The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5%, each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%).
NA,Forty-one patients (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 due to disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 patients (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics and tocilizumab.
NA,No renal or cardiac failures or maternal deaths were reported.
NA,Lymphopenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (59%) were observed in the early stages of the disease.
NA,Median CRP, D-dimer and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were elevated.
NA,High CRP and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe pneumonia.
NA,The Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be the most sensitive marker for disease improvement (relative risk: 6.65; 95% CI: 4.1-5.9).
NA,During the study period, 18 of the women (78%) delivered vaginally.
NA,All newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and none of them were infected during breastfeeding.
NA,No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in placental tissue.
NA,Most of the pregnant COVID-19 positive patients had a favorable clinical course.
NA,However, one-third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status.
NA,CRP and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe pneumonia and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically.
NA,Seventy-eight percent of patients had a vaginal delivery.
NA,No vertical or horizontal transmissions were diagnosed in the neonates during labor or breastfeeding.
NA,It has been reported that dermatology practices may be a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and elective cases should be postponed during the pandemic period.
NA,In this context, studies on the change of patient profile in Dermatology outpatient clinic have been conducted.
NA,However, there was no study in the literature about dermatology consultations during the pandemic period.
NA,147 Dermatology consultation cases in the era of COVID-19 pandemic between March 11, 2020 and May 4, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. 24 patients (16.3%) had suspicion and signs of COVID during consultation (fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc.).
NA,9 (37.5%) of these patients also had accompanying COVID-19 skin lesions (2 urticarial lesions, 2 livedo and necrosis, 2 maculopapular eruption, 2 vesicular rashes, 1 pseudo-chilblain).
NA,The number of cases that were suspected to have COVID-19 was statistically significantly higher in consultations requested by the emergency department and intensive care unit, while there were no suspected cases in outpatient clinic consultations (P = 0.001).
NA,2 (1.4%) of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR within 2 weeks.
NA,We acknowledge that daily practice changes frequently during this period, but still our study provides a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the requested dermatology consultations during the pandemic.

NA,Mechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19.
NA,(PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187). 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020.
NA,Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
NA,Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus.
NA,Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included.
NA,Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders.
NA,A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
NA,Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
NA,Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
NA,Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.
NA,Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.
NA,Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.
NA,World Health Organization.
NA,Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019, the coronavirus has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate.
NA,The transmissibility of the coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention.
NA,An important study using COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
NA,However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-square tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-square test.
NA,We reanalyze the data from the city of Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
NA,We excluded the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopted a more appropriate statistical method, including the permutation test and the Fisher exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo.
NA,After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, the Fisher exact test yields a P value of .84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis.
NA,The odds ratio of the coronavirus transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval 0.5-2.8.
NA,Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we concluded that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic of the human respiratory illness COVID-19, resulting in a severe threat to public health and safety.
NA,Analysis of the genetic tree suggests that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same Betacoronavirus group as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
NA,Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat.
NA,The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
NA,There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
NA,Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
NA,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the coronavirus disease COVID-19) is highly transmissible among people.
NA,Asymptomatic infections are also an important source of infection.
NA,Here, we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.
NA,We identified close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in northeast Chongqing who were RT-PCR+ yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections.
NA,We stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest CT, and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors.
NA,Between January and March, 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients.
NA,Of these, 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings.
NA,The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities.
NA,Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days (range 1 to 29), and 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,Nine subjects (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively.
NA,The median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 13 days, compared to 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT (p &lt; 0.05).
NA,A portion of these asymptomatic individuals, with and without abnormal chest CT scans, were capable of transmitting the virus to others.
NA,Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential.
NA,Studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.
NA,The aim of this study was to estimate the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period across China.
NA,In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period among 34 provincial regions in China.
NA,Our main assumption was that blood donors of all ages in different regions have a stable blood donation intention and the same infection risk.
NA,First, we estimated the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and China, from December 31, 2019 to March 17, 2020.
NA,Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in all provinces across China.
NA,In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID-19 incubation period.
NA,Moreover, if the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%.
NA,Although the risk is low, with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 and the appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and a high fatality rate, appropriate measures should be taken by health departments to ensure the safety of clinical blood.
NA,The ACR recognizes that radiology practices are grappling with when and how to safely resume routine radiology care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
NA,Although it is unclear how long the pandemic will last, it may persist for many months.
NA,Throughout this time, it will be important to perform safe, comprehensive, and effective care for patients with and patients without COVID-19, recognizing that asymptomatic transmission is common with this disease.
NA,Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy.
NA,However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments.
NA,A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment (PPE); local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity.
NA,An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible due to many unknown and complex factors.
NA,However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.
NA,The epidemic of pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its harm degree is defined as a global &quot;pandemic&quot;.
NA,At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease.
NA,The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing.
NA,Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses.
NA,Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures.
NA,In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2.
NA,This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19.
NA,Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.
NA,The delivery of endoscopic care is changing rapidly in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time.
NA,Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply.
NA,Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission.
NA,We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification.
NA,This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet.
NA,In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk.
NA,To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures).
NA,This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide.
NA,It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is now a global pandemic.
NA,Human-to-human transmission has been documented to occur through respiratory secretions, feces, aerosols, and contaminated environmental surfaces.
NA,Pediatric patients present a unique challenge as they may have minimal symptoms and yet transmit disease.
NA,Endoscopists face risk for infection with viruses like SARS-CoV-2, as the aerosol generating nature of endoscopy diffuses respiratory disease that can be spread via an airborne and droplet route.
NA,We describe our center's methodology for pediatric patient risk stratification to facilitate responsible use of endoscopic resources during this crisis.
NA,We also describe our recommendations for use of personal protective equipment by endoscopists, with the goal of ensuring the safety of ourselves, our anesthesiology and endoscopy staff, and our patients.
NA,To understand the epidemiology and burden of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) during the first epidemic wave on the west coast of the United States.
NA,Prospective cohort study.
NA,Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees.
NA,Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington).
NA,Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay.
NA,The effective reproduction number (<i>R<sub>E</sub></i> ) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region.
NA,As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington.
NA,Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days).
NA,The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%).
NA,For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days).
NA,The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients.
NA,Reductions in <i>R<sub>E</sub></i> were identified over the study period within each region.
NA,Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high.
NA,Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing interventions.
NA,addresses a number of aspects of the mother-infant dyad management during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
NA,Networking among maternity centers and anticipatory planning is essential to organise the assistance to mothers and neonates in maternity and neonatal wards.
NA,Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, before delivery, allows their management through dedicated protocols and minimizes the risk of contagion for other patients and healthcare providers.
NA,Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded at present, and should be ruled out as soon as possible after birth.
NA,Rooming in of infected mothers and neonates, provided their good clinical conditions, is not contraindicated based on current knowledge.
NA,The choice of breastfeeding should be carefully discussed with parents based on current, evolving scientific evidence.
NA,We simulated three transmission modes including close contact, respiratory droplets and aerosol routes in labratory.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 can be highly transmitted among naive hACE2 mice via close contact because 7/13 naive hACE2 mice were SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seropositivity on 14 days after introduced into the same cage with 3 infected-hACE2 mice.
NA,For respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from 3/10 naive hACE2 mice showed seropositivity on 14 days after introduced into the grids separated same cage from 3 infected-hACE2 mice.
NA,Additionally, hACE2 mice cannot be experimentally infected via aerosol inoculation until continued up to 25 min with high virus concentrations.
NA,The worldwide outbreak of the severe and acute respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 is currently the focal point of discussion due to the suffering this syndrome is causing to humanity.
NA,However, the ophthalmological implications of this syndrome has not yet been well described.
NA,Both eyes and tears as portals of entry and sources of contagion have been the subject of debate by many authors.
NA,The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence currently available on COVID-19 and its ocular implications and manifestations, in both animals and humans, with the aim to facilitate prevention and educate the ophthalmological community on this subject.
NA,A review of the literature revealed that the results of some studies suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is possible to isolate the virus from the conjunctival sac of these patients.
NA,Conjunctivitis is not a common manifestation of the disease, but contact with infected eyes could be one route of transmission.
NA,Consequently, ophthalmologists need to have correct prevention strategies in place.
NA,Some guidelines regarding the prevention and management of ophthalmology clinics are reviewed.
NA,However, well-designed trials should be conducted to rule out other ocular manifestations that may result from COVID-19 infection and to understand the transmission of the virus through the eyes.
NA,The practice of radiation oncology requires stringent adherence to specific steps and principles designed to minimize exposure of an individual to unnecessary doses of radiation.
NA,The basic principles of such measures to reduce the risk of exposure and limit the doses of irradiation follow the &quot;as low as reasonably achievable &quot; or ALARA principle by using the concepts of time, distance and shielding.
NA,Potential exposures in radiation oncology are controlled through combination of optimal design and installation of radiation delivery equipment with well-defined standard operating procedures (SOPs).
NA,In the modern era of viral pandemics, similar principles can also be applied toward prevention of viral transmission and protection of populations at risk.
NA,In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of an individual getting infected is dependent on the viral load that an individual is exposed to in public spaces over a period of time.
NA,All prevention and control measures are based on preventing any such exposure to the virus, that can be achieved through limiting space for movement of the virus, using barriers and increasing distance to vulnerable surfaces, and limiting the duration of exposure.
NA,Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission.
NA,Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.
NA,The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges.
NA,However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.
NA,During COVID-19 pandemic, there continues to be a need to utilize cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories for emergent and urgent procedures.
NA,Per infection prevention guidelines, and hospital codes, catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories are usually built as positive pressure ventilation rooms to minimize the infection risk.
NA,However, patients with highly transmissible airborne diseases such as COVID-19 are best cared in negative ventilation rooms to minimize the risk of transmission.
NA,From mechanical and engineering perspective, positive pressure ventilation rooms cannot be readily converted to negative pressure ventilation rooms.
NA,In this report, we describe a novel, quick, readily implantable and resource friendly approach on how to secure air quality in catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories by converting a positive pressure ventilation room to a 2-zone negative ventilation system to minimize the risk of transmission.

NA,Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.
NA,Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring.
NA,As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented.
NA,To estimate the comparative efficacy of individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease.
NA,Specifically, we fit a model to the incubation period distribution (mean 5·2 days) and to two estimates of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4·8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7·5 days.
NA,To assess variable resource settings, we considered two feasibility settings: a high-feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and a low-feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a 2-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation.
NA,Model fitting by sequential Monte Carlo resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset before symptom onset of 0·77 days (95% CI -1·98 to 0·29) for the shorter serial interval, and for the longer serial interval it resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset after symptom onset of 0·51 days (95% CI -0·77 to 1·50).
NA,Individual quarantine in high-feasibility settings, where at least 75% of infected contacts are individually quarantined, contains an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with a short serial interval (4·8 days) 84% of the time.
NA,However, in settings where the outbreak continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms).
NA,When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts.
NA,Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number &lt;1).
NA,Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts.
NA,To the extent that these interventions can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institutes of Health.
NA,Herein, we describe the detection of a SARS-CoV-2 genome through metatranscriptome next-generation sequencing directly from the nasopharyngeal swab of a suspected case of local transmission of Covid-19, in Brazil.
NA,Depletion of human ribosomal RNA and use of an optimized in-house developed bioinformatics strategy contributed to successful detection of the virus.
NA,Delirium is a common symptom in patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19, and in cases of hyperactive delirium we have frequently observed behaviors that pose a significant risk of disease transmission to health care providers.
NA,Managing this symptom has emerged as an important challenge, as our local health care system has been strained by providers becoming sick or quarantined.
NA,Preventative and non-pharmacologic interventions remain critical for managing delirium in such patients, though occasionally pharmacologic treatment is required.
NA,When use of an antipsychotic medication is indicated, we recommend that providers consider foregoing the lowest common dose and instead start with the next incrementally higher dose to more quickly and reliably ensure the safety of both patients and providers.
NA,We do not recommend initiating prophylactic treatment or escalating doses in a manner that conflicts with currently accepted guidelines without carefully considering the risks and benefits.
NA,The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission poses challenges for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease.
NA,We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals.
NA,If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased.
NA,Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R<sub>0</sub> will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R<sub>0</sub> will be under-estimated.
NA,Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals.
NA,Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics.
NA,This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission.
NA,The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the world into the midst of a new pandemic.
NA,In the human body, the virus causes COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus that causes the disease SARS.
NA,Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces.
NA,Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the US and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis.
NA,Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines.
NA,The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020.
NA,As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness.
NA,In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases.
NA,Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world.
NA,We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic.
NA,The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic.
NA,In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.
NA,Oculo-centric factors may provide a key to understanding invasion success by SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious, potentially lethal, virus with ocular tropism.
NA,Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis.
NA,The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact.
NA,The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut.
NA,Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge.
NA,Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission.
NA,Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering.
NA,This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration.
NA,A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.
NA,In areas of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide mean air pollutants concentrations vastly exceed the maximum limits.
NA,Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-coV2.
NA,The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths.
NA,COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and mortality rate were correlated with severity of air pollution in the Italian regions.
NA,The highest number of COVID-19 cases were recorded in the most polluted regions with patients presenting with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU admission.
NA,In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions.
NA,From the data available we propose a &quot;double-hit hypothesis&quot;: chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression.
NA,This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences.
NA,High atmospheric NO2 may provide a second hit causing a severe form of SARS-CoV-19 in ACE-2 depleted lungs resulting in a worse outcome.
NA,The month of December 2019 became a critical part of the time of humanity when the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Wuhan, Hubei Province in China.
NA,As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19.
NA,The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans.
NA,In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly.
NA,Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions.
NA,The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea.
NA,However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms.
NA,It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
NA,Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
NA,Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
NA,Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
NA,A number of neurological disease complications have been seen following infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,While most person with COVID-19 respiratory disease demonstrate headache, nausea and vomiting, up to 40% present also experience dizziness, confusion, cerebrovascular disease, muscle pain, ataxia and seizures.
NA,Loss of taste and smell, defects in visual acuity and pain occur in parallel.
NA,Such central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms linked to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is often life threatening.
NA,Health care providers currently evaluating patients with neurologic symptoms need consider COVID-19 in any differential diagnosis.
NA,These considerations will facilitate prompt testing, isolation and prevention of viral transmission speeding best clinical outcomes.
NA,Graphical Abstract.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence rates for dental diseases will continue unabated.
NA,However, the intent to prevent the spread of this lethal respiratory disease will likely lead to reduced treatment access due to restrictions on population movements.
NA,These changes have the potential to increase dental-related emergency department visits and subsequently contribute to greater viral transmission.
NA,Moreover, dentists experience unique challenges with preventing transmission due to frequent aerosol-producing procedures.
NA,This paper presents reviews and protocols implemented by directors and residents at the Dental College of Georgia to manage a dental emergency clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The methods presented include committee-based prioritization of dental patients, a multilayered screening process, team rotations with social and temporal spacing, and modified treatment room protocols.
NA,These efforts aid in the reduction of viral transmission, conservation of personal protective equipment, and expand provider availability.
NA,These protocols transcend a university and hospital-based models and are applicable to private and corporate models.
NA,The world entered the year 2020 with reports of the emergence of a new viral illness in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
NA,In January 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified to be the causative novel coronavirus for the cluster of patients suffering from pneumonia in China.
NA,The disease was later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
NA,Several studies, since then, have tried to study and explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2, its structure and pathogenicity, epidemiology, modes of transmission, spectrum of illness and causes of mortality and morbidity.
NA,The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications.
NA,With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope.
NA,This review intends to cover the current known aspects of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-19, based on the available literature.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is a new pandemic influenza caused by a coronavirus which main route of transmission is through exhaled droplets that primarily infect the nose and the nasopharynx.
NA,The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of acetic acid, the active component of vinegar, as a potential disinfectant agent for upper airways.
NA,Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and divided into two groups: group 1 (14 patients) was composed of patients treated with off-label hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, whereas group 2 (15 patients) was composed of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, combined with the inhalation of acetic acid disinfectant at a 0.34% concentration.
NA,A questionnaire-based evaluation of symptoms was performed after 15 days in both groups.
NA,It appears that the number of patients treated with acetic acid (group 2) that experienced improvement in individual symptoms was double that of the other group of patients (group 1), although numbers are too small for robust statistical analysis.
NA,Considering its potential benefits and high availability, acetic acid disinfection appears to be a promising adjunctive therapy in cases of non-severe COVID-19 and deserves further investigation.
NA,In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China causing many cases of severe pneumonia.
NA,World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19.
NA,As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths.
NA,The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation.
NA,The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators.
NA,The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies.
NA,Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes.
NA,Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.
NA,Recurrence of positive SARS CoV-2 PCR has been described in patients discharged from hospital after 2 consecutive negative PCR.
NA,We discuss possible explanations including false negative, reactivation and re-infection and propose different strategy to solve this issue.
NA,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and recurrence of viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic patients remain unknown.
NA,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic carriers had been documented.
NA,Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, it is necessary to carry out large studies to better understand the issue of potential SARS-CoV-2 recurrence in COVID-19 patients.

NA,The World Health Organization declared a pandemic when coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to sweep the globe.
NA,Growing concerns for the safety of health care workers was raised when up to 80% of people with COVID-19 showed mild or no symptoms at all.
NA,Some surgical procedures will be inevitable during the pandemic, and proper safety measures must be in place to avoid transmission risks.
NA,Surgical smoke is a common by-product from the use of energy devices in the operating room.
NA,The effects of surgical smoke have been studied for more than 40 years, and potential health hazards have been reported.
NA,Chemicals, carcinogens and biologically active materials, such as bacteria and viruses, have been isolated in surgical smoke.
NA,To ensure the safety of operating room personnel, we must consider whether there is any concern of viral transmission from the inhalation of surgical smoke.
NA,This study aims to provide both a model by using cumulative cases and cumulative death toll for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) outbreak in 4 countries, China, Italy, South Korea, and Turkey, starting from the first diagnosis and to compare associated indicators.
NA,The most successful estimation was obtained from the cubic model with natural logarithm for China, Italy, South Korea, and Turkey.
NA,The success of the models was around 99%.
NA,However, differences began to emerge in China, Italy, and South Korea after the second week.
NA,Although the highest number of new cases per 1 million people in China was 9.8 on February 28, 2020; it was 108.4 on March 21, 2020, in Italy; and this was 16.6 on March 5, 2020, in South Korea.
NA,On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey.
NA,The log-cubic model proposed in this study has been set forth to obtain successful results for aforementioned countries, as well as to estimate the course of the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Other factors such as climacteric factors and genetic differences, which may have an impact on viral spreading and transmission, would also have strengthened the model prediction capacity.
NA,To provide evolving information on active protocols regarding inpatient, outpatient, procedural, and surgical case management taking place in otolaryngology practices in response to COVID-19.
NA,Cross-sectional multi-institutional survey.
NA,An online survey of 55 otolaryngology departments across North America.
NA,As of March 25, 2020, almost all (n = 53 of 55, 96.3%) otolaryngology departments had canceled elective cases and were performing only urgent consults.
NA,Most residents continued to participate in operative cases (n = 45 of 49, 91.8%) and take call (n = 48 of 50, 96.0%).
NA,Of the respondents, 27 of 29 (93.1%) stated that they were deferring nonemergent tracheostomy procedures for the time being.
NA,The use of personal protective equipment followed a general trend of an increasing level of protection with an increased risk of the procedure; most (n = 49 of 54, 90.7%) incorporated N95 mask usage for bedside/clinic examinations with flexible laryngoscopy.
NA,Powered air-purifying respirators and N95 masks were used mainly for procedures involving the mucosal surfaces.
NA,Due to the high viral density in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19, basic examinations and common otolaryngology procedures place practitioners at high risk of exposure.
NA,Although there is variability in practice among otolaryngologists across North America in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, most are primarily seeing urgent ambulatory and inpatient consultations.
NA,Most are also incorporating personal protective equipment appropriate to the level of transmission across mucous membranes.
NA,In these rapidly evolving times, it is helpful to find solidarity and assurance among health care providers.
NA,Current data aimed to provide (1) perceived methods regarding the safe care of otolaryngology patients and (2) updated practice patterns at a national level.
NA,Sport makes an important contribution to the physical, psychological and emotional well-being of Australians.
NA,The economic contribution of sport is equivalent to 2-3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on communities globally, leading to significant restrictions on all sectors of society, including sport.
NA,Resumption of sport can significantly contribute to the re-establishment of normality in Australian society.
NA,The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), in consultation with sport partners (National Institute Network (NIN) Directors, NIN Chief Medical Officers (CMOs), National Sporting Organisation (NSO) Presidents, NSO Performance Directors and NSO CMOs), has developed a framework to inform the resumption of sport.
NA,National Principles for Resumption of Sport were used as a guide in the development of 'the AIS Framework for Rebooting Sport in a COVID-19 Environment' (the AIS Framework); and based on current best evidence, and guidelines from the Australian Federal Government, extrapolated into the sporting context by specialists in sport and exercise medicine, infectious diseases and public health.
NA,The principles outlined in this document apply to high performance/professional, community and individual passive (non-contact) sport.
NA,The AIS Framework is a timely tool of minimum baseline of standards, for 'how' reintroduction of sport activity will occur in a cautious and methodical manner, based on the best available evidence to optimise athlete and community safety.
NA,Decisions regarding the timing of resumption (the 'when') of sporting activity must be made in close consultation with Federal, State/Territory and/or Local Public Health Authorities.
NA,The priority at all times must be to preserve public health, minimising the risk of community transmission.
NA,The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been unprecedented in its speed and effects.
NA,Interruption of its transmission to prevent widespread community transmission is critical because its effects go beyond the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and affect the health system capacity to provide other essential services.
NA,Highlighting the implications of such a situation, the predictions presented here are derived using a Markov chain model, with the transition states and country specific probabilities derived based on currently available knowledge.
NA,A risk of exposure, and vulnerability index are used to make the probabilities country specific.
NA,The results predict a high risk of exposure in states of small size, together with Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon.
NA,Nigeria will have the largest number of infections, followed by Algeria and South Africa.
NA,Mauritania would have the fewest cases, followed by Seychelles and Eritrea.
NA,Per capita, Mauritius, Seychelles and Equatorial Guinea would have the highest proportion of their population affected, while Niger, Mauritania and Chad would have the lowest.
NA,Of the World Health Organization's 1 billion population in Africa, 22% (16%-26%) will be infected in the first year, with 37 (29 - 44) million symptomatic cases and 150 078 (82 735-189 579) deaths.
NA,There will be an estimated 4.6 (3.6-5.5) million COVID-19 hospitalisations, of which 139 521 (81 876-167 044) would be severe cases requiring oxygen, and 89 043 (52 253-106 599) critical cases requiring breathing support.
NA,The needed mitigation measures would significantly strain health system capacities, particularly for secondary and tertiary services, while many cases may pass undetected in primary care facilities due to weak diagnostic capacity and non-specific symptoms.
NA,The effect of avoiding widespread and sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is significant, and most likely outweighs any costs of preventing such a scenario.
NA,Effective containment measures should be promoted in all countries to best manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,At the end of December 2019, a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) appeared as the third unheard of outbreak of human coronavirus infection in the 21st century.
NA,First, in Wuhan, China, the novel SARS-CoV2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO), as 2019-nCOV (COVID-19), and spread extremely all over the world.
NA,SARS-CoV2 is transmitted to individuals by human-to-human transmission leading to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory system injury.
NA,SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction.
NA,There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered.
NA,Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic.
NA,In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases.
NA,The new acute respiratory disease severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious.
NA,It has caused many deaths, despite a relatively low general case fatality rate (CFR).
NA,The most common early manifestations of infection are fever, cough, fatigue and myalgia.
NA,The diagnosis is based on the exposure history, clinical manifestation, laboratory test results, chest computed tomography (CT) findings and a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy is not already clear.
NA,There is no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population.
NA,In the third trimester, COVID-19 can cause premature rupture of membranes, premature labour and fetal distress.
NA,There are no data on complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection before the third trimester.
NA,COVID-19 infection is an indication for delivery if necessary to improve maternal oxygenation.
NA,Decision on delivery mode should be individualised.
NA,Vertical transmission of coronavirus from the pregnant woman to the fetus has not been proven.
NA,As the virus is absent in breast milk, the experts encourage breastfeeding for neonatal acquisition of protective antibodies.
NA,Months after the outbreak of a new flu-like disease in China, the entire world is now in a state of caution.
NA,The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
NA,Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
NA,This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.
NA,Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed.
NA,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses serious threat to global public health and economics.
NA,Serial interval (SI), time between the symptom onsets of a primary case and a second case, is a key epidemiological parameter.
NA,We estimated SI of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China based on 27 records of transmission chains.
NA,We adopted three parametric models: Weibull, Lognormal and Gamma distributions and an interval censored likelihood framework.
NA,The three models were compared using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc).
NA,We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the exponential growth to estimate the reproduction number.
NA,Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated mean SI at 5.9 days (95%CI: 3.9-9.6) and a standard deviation (SD) at 4.8 days (95%CI: 3.1-10.1).
NA,Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen at 2.6 (95%CI: 2.4-2.8).
NA,The SI of COVID-19 is relative shorter than that of SARS and MERS, other two beta coronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission was rapid.
NA,It is crucial to isolate close contacts promptly to control the spread of COVID-19 effectively.
NA,In the era of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of infectious airborne aerosol generation during otolaryngologic procedures has been an area of increasing concern.
NA,The objective of this investigation was to quantify airborne aerosol production under clinical and surgical conditions and examine efficacy of mask mitigation strategies.
NA,Prospective quantification of airborne aerosol generation during surgical and clinical simulation.
NA,Cadaver laboratory and clinical examination room.
NA,Airborne aerosol quantification with an optical particle sizer was performed in real time during cadaveric simulated endoscopic surgical conditions, including hand instrumentation, microdebrider use, high-speed drilling, and cautery.
NA,Aerosol sampling was additionally performed in simulated clinical and diagnostic settings.
NA,All clinical and surgical procedures were evaluated for propensity for significant airborne aerosol generation.
NA,Hand instrumentation and microdebridement did not produce detectable airborne aerosols in the range of 1 to 10 μm.
NA,Suction drilling at 12,000 rpm, high-speed drilling (4-mm diamond or cutting burs) at 70,000 rpm, and transnasal cautery generated significant airborne aerosols (<i>P</i> &lt; .001).
NA,In clinical simulations, nasal endoscopy (<i>P</i> &lt; .05), speech (<i>P</i> &lt; .01), and sneezing (<i>P</i> &lt; .01) generated 1- to 10-μm airborne aerosols.
NA,Significant aerosol escape was seen even with utilization of a standard surgical mask (<i>P</i> &lt; .05).
NA,Intact and VENT-modified (valved endoscopy of the nose and throat) N95 respirator use prevented significant airborne aerosol spread.
NA,Transnasal drill and cautery use is associated with significant airborne particulate matter production in the range of 1 to 10 μm under surgical conditions.
NA,During simulated clinical activity, airborne aerosol generation was seen during nasal endoscopy, speech, and sneezing.
NA,Intact or VENT-modified N95 respirators mitigated airborne aerosol transmission, while standard surgical masks did not.
NA,Primary healthcare centers (PHCs) represent the first tier of the Indian healthcare system, provides a range of essential outpatient services to people living in the rural, suburban, and hard to reach areas.
NA,Diversion of healthcare resources for containing the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly undermined the accessibility and availability of essential health services.
NA,Under these circumstances, the preparedness of PHCs in providing safe patient-centered care for meeting the current health needs of the population and prevent further transmission of the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial.
NA,To determine the primary healthcare (PHC) facility preparedness towards the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.
NA,We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary healthcare facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India.
NA,A list of 60 faculty involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated to the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database.
NA,We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24-April 30 2020 using a google-forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants.
NA,The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care.
NA,A total of 51 faculty responded to the survey.
NA,Each medical college/institution was having on average (SD) a total of 2.94 (1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction.
NA,Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (49%), suboptimal ventilation (57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (75.5%).
NA,N-95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites.
NA,Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% and 27.4% sites, respectively.
NA,The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, were significantly disrupted (p &lt; 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures.
NA,Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policymakers and health managers working at primary healthcare facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.
NA,IEC Clearance F.1/IEC/MAMC/(73/01/2020/No68).
NA,To analyze the impact of COVID-19 emergency on elective oncological surgical activity in Italy.
NA,COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases.
NA,Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate.
NA,A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors.
NA,The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy.
NA,In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%).
NA,After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%).
NA,The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036).
NA,In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week.
NA,The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P &lt; 0.001).
NA,Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients.
NA,The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).
NA,Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).
NA,This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list.
NA,The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately.
NA,The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.
NA,To investigate differences in viral shedding in respiratory and fecal samples from children with COVID-19.
NA,We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase and Web of Science databases to identify pediatric studies comparing the pattern of fecal and respiratory shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects models.
NA,Four studies reporting data from 36 children were included.
NA,A higher proportion of children had viral shedding in stools after 14 days of symptoms onset compared to respiratory samples (RR= 3.2, 95%CI 1.2 to 8.9, I2 = 51%).
NA,Viral RNA shedding was longer in fecal samples with a mean difference of approximately 9 days (Mean Difference = 8.6, 95%CI 1.7 to 15.4, I2 = 77%) compared with respiratory samples.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 shedding seems to be present in feces for a longer time than in the respiratory tract of children.
NA,Although fecal SARS-CoV-2 presence in feces do not confirm its transmissibility, the high and fast spread of the COVID-19 disease worldwide indicate other transmission routes are also plausible.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact around the world.
NA,With high rates of transmission and no curative therapies or vaccine yet available, the current cornerstone of management focuses on prevention by social distancing.
NA,This includes decreased health care contact for patients.
NA,Patients with lung cancer are a particularly vulnerable population, where the risk of mortality from cancer must now be balanced by the potential risk of a life-threatening infection.
NA,In these unprecedented times, a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach is required to streamline but not compromise care.
NA,We have developed guidelines at our academic cancer center to standardize management of patients with lung cancer across our health care system and provide guidance to the larger oncology community.
NA,We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression.
NA,We recognize that our recommendations may change over time based on clinical resources and the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,In principle, however, treatment paradigms must continue to be individualized, with careful consideration of risks and benefits of continuing or altering lung cancer-directed therapy.
NA,We explored the secondary attack rate in different types of contact with persons presymptomatic for coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
NA,Close contacts who lived with or had frequent contact with an index case-patient had a higher risk for COVID-19.
NA,Our findings provide population-based evidence for transmission from persons with presymptomatic COVID-19 infections.
NA,During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical departments were forced to re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent procedures and non-deferrable oncological cases.
NA,There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department.
NA,Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature.
NA,A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.
NA,After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed.
NA,Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not.
NA,Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure.
NA,There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches.
NA,Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.
NA,Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.
NA,During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid transformation and adaptation of healthcare services.
NA,Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are one of the largest high-risk groups accessing antenatal care.
NA,In reformulating the care offered to those with GDM, there is a need to balance the sometimes competing requirement of lowering the risk of direct viral transmission against the potential adverse impact of service changes.
NA,We suggest pragmatic options for screening of GDM in a pandemic setting based on blood tests, and risk calculators applied to underlying risk factors.
NA,Alternative models for antenatal care provision for women with GDM, including targeting high-risk groups, early lifestyle interventions and remote monitoring are provided.
NA,Testing options and their timing for postpartum screening in women who had GDM are also considered.
NA,Our suggestions are only applicable in a pandemic scenario; usual guidelines and care pathways should be re-implemented as soon as possible and appropriate.
NA,The worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the syndrome designated COVID-19, presents a challenge for emergency operative management.
NA,The transmission and virulence of this new pathogen has raised concern for how best to protect operating room staff while effectively providing care to the infected patient requiring urgent or emergent surgery.
NA,Establishment of a clear protocol that adheres to rigorous infection control measures while providing a safe system for interfacility transport and operative care is vital to a successful surgical pandemic response.
NA,While emergency protocols must be rapidly developed, they should be collaboratively improved and incorporate new knowledge as and when it becomes available.
NA,These measures combined with practice drills to keep operating room personnel ready and able should help construct processes that are useful, easy to follow, and tailored to the unique local environment of each health care setting.
NA,After the initial apprehensions and struggles during our confrontation with the COVID-19 crisis, it is our hope that the experience we share will be helpful to surgical staff at other institutions grappling with the challenges of operative care in the pandemic environment.
NA,While this protocol focuses on the current COVID-19 pandemic, these recommendations serve as a template for surgical preparedness that can be readily adapted to infectious disease crisis that unfortunately might emerge in the future.
NA,This article presents additional strategies to the medical professional and support tactics to keep both the health care provider and patient as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Follicular conjunctivitis has been reported as an early sign of infection or during hospitalization for severe COVID-19 disease.
NA,It has been confirmed that COVID-19 is transmitted through both respiratory droplets and direct contact.
NA,Another possible route of viral transmission is entry through aerosolized droplets into the tears, which then pass through the nasolacrimal ducts and into the respiratory tract.
NA,For nonemergent care, eye care providers should use telehealth.
NA,Eye care providers should prioritize patient care in order of absolute necessity, such as sudden vision loss, sudden onset flashes and floaters, and eye trauma.
NA,In those cases, exposure should be minimized.
NA,The close proximity between eye care providers and their patients during slit-lamp examination may require further precautions, such as shields, barriers, and mask use to lower the risk of transmission via droplets or through hand to eye contact.
NA,All nonemergent eye care appointments should be delayed or conducted remotely.
NA,For emergent in-person appointments, careful and appropriate adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations may minimize exposure for both the health care provider and patient.
NA,Italy and South Korea have two distinctly different healthcare systems, causing them to respond to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic in markedly different ways.
NA,Differences exist in medical education for both countries, allowing South Korean medical graduates to have a more holistic education in comparison to their Italian counterparts, who specialize in medical education earlier on.
NA,Additionally, there are fewer South Korean physicians per 1000 people in South Korea compared to Italian physicians per 1000 people in Italy.
NA,However, both countries have a national healthcare system with universal healthcare coverage.
NA,Despite this underlying similarity, the two countries addressed COVID-19 in nearly opposite manners.
NA,South Korea employed technology and the holistic education of its physician community, despite having a smaller proportion of physicians in society, to its advantage by implementing efficacious drive-through centers that test suspected individuals rapidly and with little to no contact with healthcare staff, decreasing the possibility of transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Conversely, Italy is presently considered the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe and has recorded the highest death toll of any country outside of mainland China.
NA,This is partially due to the reactionary nature of Italy's public health measures compared to South Korea's proactive response.
NA,The different healthcare responses of South Korea and Italy can inform decisions made by public health bodies in other countries, especially in countries across the Americas, which can selectively adopt policies that have worked in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and learn from mistakes made by both countries.
NA,Italia y Corea del Sur tienen dos sistemas de atención sanitaria claramente diferentes, lo que hace que respondan a crisis de salud pública como la pandemia por COVID-19 de maneras marcadamente distintas.
NA,Existen diferencias en la educación médica de ambos países, lo que permite a los graduados de medicina de Corea del Sur tener una educación más holística en comparación con sus homólogos italianos, que siguen una especialización médica de manera más temprana.
NA,Además, en Corea del Sur hay menos médicos por cada 1 000 personas en comparación con Italia.
NA,Sin embargo, ambos países tienen un sistema nacional de salud con cobertura universal.
NA,A pesar de esta similitud subyacente, los dos países abordaron la COVID-19 de maneras casi opuestas.
NA,A pesar de contar con una proporción menor de médicos en la sociedad, Corea del Sur empleó la tecnología y la educación holística de su comunidad médica a su favor al implementar centros de examen de personas con sospecha de infección sin descender del automóvil, que permitían una atención rápida y con poco o ningún contacto con el personal de salud, lo que disminuyó la posibilidad de transmisión de la enfermedad.
NA,Por el contrario, Italia es considerada actualmente el epicentro del brote en Europa y ha registrado el mayor número de muertes que cualquier otro país fuera de la China continental.
NA,Esto se debe en parte a la naturaleza reactiva de las medidas de salud pública de Italia en comparación con la respuesta proactiva de Corea del Sur.
NA,Las diferentes respuestas sanitarias de Corea del Sur e Italia pueden orientar las decisiones que deben tomar los organismos de salud pública de otros países, especialmente en la Región de las Américas, que pueden adoptar selectivamente políticas que han funcionado para reducir la propagación de la COVID-19 y aprender de los errores cometidos por ambos países.
NA,A Itália e a Coreia do Sul têm dois sistemas de saúde distintos, o que os leva a responder a crises de saúde pública, como a pandemia COVID-19, de formas marcadamente diferentes.
NA,Existem diferenças na educação médica dos dois países, permitindo que os médicos sul-coreanos tenham uma educação mais holística em comparação com os seus homólogos italianos, que seguem uma especialização médica mais cedo.
NA,Além disso, há menos médicos por 1 000 pessoas na Coreia do Sul do que em Itália.
NA,No entanto, ambos os países têm um sistema nacional de saúde com cobertura de saúde universal.
NA,Apesar desta semelhança subjacente, os dois países abordaram a COVID-19 de maneiras quase opostas.
NA,Apesar de ter uma proporção menor de médicos na sociedade, a Coreia do Sul utilizou a tecnologia e a educação holística de sua comunidade médica a seu favor, implementando centros de rastreio para pessoas com suspeita de infecção sem sair do carro, o que permitiu cuidados imediatos e pouco ou nenhum contacto com o pessoal de saúde, diminuindo assim a possibilidade de transmissão da COVID-19.
NA,Por outro lado, a Itália é atualmente considerada o epicentro do surto na Europa e tem registrado o maior número de mortes de qualquer país fora da China continental.
NA,Isto deve-se em parte à natureza reactiva das medidas de saúde pública da Itália em comparação com a resposta pró-ativa da Coreia do Sul.
NA,As diferentes respostas de saúde da Coreia do Sul e da Itália podem informar as decisões das agências de saúde pública de outros países, especialmente da Região das Américas, que podem adoptar seletivamente políticas que tenham funcionado na redução da disseminação da COVID-19 e aprender com os erros cometidos por ambos os países.

NA,A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed Central, LILACS, and Google Scholar using the keywords 'covid ' AND 'newborn' OR 'child' OR 'infant,' on 18 March 2020, and again on 17 April 2020.
NA,One researcher conducted the search and extracted data on demographics, maternal outcomes, diagnostic tests, imaging, and neonatal outcomes.
NA,Of 256 publications identified, 20 met inclusion criteria and comprised neonatal outcome data for 222 newborns whose mothers were suspected or confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive perinatally (17 studies) or of newborns referred to hospital with infection/pneumonia (3 studies).
NA,Most (12 studies) were case-series reports; all were from China, except three (Australia, Iran, and Spain).
NA,Of the 222 newborns, 13 were reported as positive for SARS-CoV-2; most of the studies reported no or mild symptoms and no adverse perinatal outcomes.
NA,Two papers among those from newborns who tested positive reported moderate or severe clinical characteristics.
NA,Five studies using data on umbilical cord blood, placenta, and/or amniotic fluid reported no positive results.
NA,Nine studies reported radiographic imaging, including 5 with images of pneumonia, increased lung marking, thickened texture, or high-density nodular shadow.
NA,Minor, non-specific changes in biochemical variables were reported.
NA,Studies that tested breast milk reported negative SARS-CoV-2 results.
NA,Given the paucity of studies at this time, vertical transmission cannot be confirmed or denied.
NA,Current literature does not support abstaining from breastfeeding nor separating mothers and newborns.
NA,Further evidence and data collection networks, particularly in the Americas, are needed for establishing definitive guidelines and recommendations.

NA,Introduction Many countries including Pakistan are currently using face masks in their pandemic control plans.
NA,Being highly prevalent, the correct use of these masks is particularly important, as an incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the rate of transmission.
NA,The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) in wearing a surgical face mask to limit the spread of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
NA,Materials and Methods This survey was conducted by interviewing HCWs using a questionnaire consisting of the basic demographic characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the use of surgical face mask to limit the new COVID-19 exposure.
NA,Each correct answer was scored 1 and each incorrect answer scored 0.
NA,The total number of questions was 16, and the final score was calculated and then labeled according to the percentage (out of 16) of correct responses as good (&gt;80%), moderate (60-80%), and poor (&lt;60%).
NA,Results A total of 392 participants with a mean age of 42.37 ± 13.34 years (341 males and 51 females) were included in the study.
NA,The overall final results were good in 138 (35.2%), moderate in 178 (45.4%), and poor in 76 (19.3%).
NA,Around 43.6% of participants knew about the correct method of wearing the masks, 68.9% knew that there are three layers, 53% stated that the middle layer act as a filter media barrier, and 75.5% knew the recommended maximum duration of wearing it.
NA,The majority (88.2%) of participants knew that a cloth face mask is not much effective, around 79.8% knew that used face mask cannot be re-used, and 44.8% knew about the yellow-coded bag for disposal.
NA,Conclusions Knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCWs regarding the use of face masks were found to be inadequate.
NA,Studied HCWs had a positive attitude but moderate-to-poor level of knowledge and practice regarding the use of face mask.
NA,HCWs and general public awareness campaigns regarding the proper use of face mask by utilizing all social media available resources would be helpful during this pandemic.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe, becoming a major public health challenge not for China only, but also for countries around the world.
NA,Despite worldwide efforts to contain viral spread, the outbreak has not been stopped yet.
NA,Among healthcare personnel, dentists seem to be at elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19.
NA,This risk is even more serious in pediatric dentistry, since affected children, frequently, present an asymptomatic, mild or moderate clinical viral infection and, therefore, they may play a major role in community-based COVID-19 transmission.
NA,To date, despite no universal guidelines are available for dental procedures in pediatric dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak, routine dental practice should be postponed and only severe dental emergencies must be treated.
NA,In the case of a dental emergency, involving a pediatric patient, dentists should be aware of which recommended management protocol can be adopted during the practice to protect patient health, to safeguard their-self and to prevent viral transmission.
NA,The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol.
NA,Pediatric dentists should keep a high level of awareness to help patients, minimize risk and prevent viral spread.
NA,COVID-19 caused rapid mass infection worldwide.
NA,Understanding its transmission characteristics, including heterogeneity and the emergence of super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases, is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics.
NA,Here, we collected information of all infected cases (135 cases) between 21 January and 26 February 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China, and grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of four generations.
NA,Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number <i>R</i> and the dispersion parameter <i>k</i> (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13-0.88), respectively.
NA,A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin.
NA,In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January.
NA,Our results highlighted more efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors.
NA,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> <i>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a national health care emergency in the United States and exposed resource shortages, particularly of health care providers trained to provide critical or intensive care.
NA,This article describes how digital health technologies are being or could be used for COVID-19 mitigation.
NA,It then proposes the National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN), which would combine digital health technologies to address this and future crises.</i> <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> <i>Subject matter experts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center examined the peer-reviewed literature and science/technology news to see what digital health technologies have already been or could be implemented to (1) support patients while limiting COVID-19 transmission, (2) increase health care providers' capability and capacity, and (3) predict/prevent future outbreaks.</i> <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> <i>Major technologies identified included telemedicine and mobile care (for COVID-19 as well as routine care), tiered telementoring, telecritical care, robotics, and artificial intelligence for monitoring.
NA,Several of these could be assimilated to form an interoperable scalable NETCCN.
NA,NETCCN would assist health care providers, wherever they are located, by obtaining real-time patient and supplies data and disseminating critical care expertise.
NA,NETCCN capabilities should be maintained between disasters and regularly tested to ensure continual readiness.</i> <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> <i>COVID-19 has demonstrated the impact of a large-scale health emergency on the existing infrastructures.
NA,Short term, an approach to meeting this challenge is to adopt existing digital health technologies.
NA,Long term, developing a NETCCN may ensure that the necessary ecosystem is available to respond to future emergencies.</i>
NA,Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been linked to ocular signs and symptoms in several case reports.
NA,Research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through close contact via respiratory droplets, but there is the possibility for ocular transmission, with the conjunctiva as a conduit as well as a source of infection.
NA,Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis, and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19-positive patients.
NA,Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears, based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
NA,The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites.
NA,All health care professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, and use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks by both the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.
NA,Surgical smoke is a well-recognized hazard in the operating room.
NA,At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies quickly published guidelines recommending avoiding laparoscopy or to consider open surgery because of the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surgical smoke or aerosol.
NA,This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy.
NA,A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications.
NA,Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50.
NA,Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol.
NA,If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
NA,Evidence-based research in this field is needed for definitive determination of safety.
NA,Currently, the local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been effectively contained in China; however, the epidemic situation of this highly infectious disease is more and more serious outside of China.
NA,Importation of COVID-19 cases from other countries and territories is therefore becoming a new challenge for the control of COVID-19 in China.
NA,Malaria was once widely epidemic in China.
NA,Nevertheless, the local transmission of this parasitic disease has been interrupted in China since the launch of the national malaria elimination programme in 2010, and great successes have been achieved in the management of appropriately 3 thousand malaria cases imported from other countries and territories annually.
NA,Hereby, the epidemiological characteristics and current epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China were analyzed and compared with malaria.
NA,Based on the successful experiences from the management of overseas imported malaria in China, the strategy and countermeasures for COVID-19 control were proposed, so as to provide insights into the response to the importation of COVID-19 from other countries and territories and the consolidation of the control achievements in China. <b>［摘要］</b> 目前, 我国新型冠状病毒肺炎本地传播已得到有效控 制, 但境外新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情形势日趋严峻。
NA,因此, 我国新 型冠状病毒肺炎防控工作面临境外输入的新挑战。
NA,疟疾曾在我 国广泛流行, 自 2010 年启动消除疟疾行动计划后, 我国不仅阻断 了疟疾本地传播, 对每年 3000 例左右境外输入性疟疾病例的防 控也卓有成效。
NA,本文通过对当前我国新型冠状病毒肺炎和疟疾 疫情形势及流行特征的比较分析, 结合我国境外输入性疟疾防控 的成功经验, 探讨当前新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控的策略和措 施, 为有效应对境外输入、巩固防控成果提供借鉴。.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 is usually transmitted through air however several recent reports have found the virus in urine.
NA,Only 187 urine samples have been reported to have been tested in the literature to date despite over 4 million cases of respiratory Covid 19 positive cases being reported worldwide.
NA,Of these 187 urine tests 6 were positive for the virus and this persisted in urine in once case for up to 42 days.
NA,The urine sample was still positive for Covid 19 despite respiratory swabs being negative.
NA,There is a potential concern therefore that Endourologists who generally perform a high number of urine prone procedures could be at risk of exposure to the virus peri operatively.
NA,There is still confusion as to the type of PPE Endourologists should use and in what circumstances.
NA,Until it is proven that urine is not a potential source for transmission of the Virus Endourologists should have a clear knowledge of the different types of PPE available and what they should use when performing procedures.
NA,Globally, more than 4 million people have been infected with COVID-19, and more than 300,000 deaths have been reported across 188 countries.
NA,Concealment of one's potential exposure to the virus has negative implications for the spread of COVID-19 across the socio-ecological spectrum, including the futility of contact-tracing efforts, exposure of frontline staff, and the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
NA,We draw lessons learned from HIV to discuss stigma and the attribution of blame surrounding the phenomenon of concealment of one's potential exposure to COVID-19 using a socio-ecological perspective.
NA,This article also illustrates the psychosocial aspect of the disease, and the negative repercussions of concealment of potential exposure on transmission in the community and to front-liners, healthcare resources, and outbreak containment.
NA,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed health care, challenged by resource constraints and fears of transmission.
NA,We report the surgical practice pattern changes in a Head and Neck Surgery department of a tertiary cancer care center and discuss the issues surrounding multidisciplinary care during the pandemic.
NA,We report data regarding outpatient visits, multidisciplinary treatment planning conference, surgical caseload, and modifications of oncologic therapy during this pandemic and compared this data to the same interval last year.
NA,We found a 46.7% decrease in outpatient visits and a 46.8% decrease in surgical caseload, compared to 2019.
NA,We discuss the factors involved in the decision-making process and perioperative considerations.
NA,Surgical practice patterns in head and neck oncologic surgery will continue to change with the evolving pandemic.
NA,Despite constraints, we strive to prioritize and balance the oncologic and safety needs of patients with head and neck cancer in the face of COVID-19.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative pathogen in an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases originating in Wuhan, China, with an ensuing rapid global spread that led it to be declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020.
NA,Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace.
NA,In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients.
NA,In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state.
NA,Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
NA,COVID-19 has led to dramatic changes globally in persons' everyday lives.
NA,To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders.
NA,There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health.
NA,The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale.
NA,In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, eleven of the fifty states had issued stay-at-home orders.
NA,The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the U.S. allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states.
NA,The current manuscript examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020 across each state and Washington D.C.
NA,Specifically, the current manuscript examines differential change in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states.
NA,Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23.
NA,Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
NA,Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation.
NA,Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety.
NA,These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders.
NA,Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.
NA,The morbidity, mortality and blistering pace of transmission of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented worldwide health crisis.
NA,COVID-19, the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain on critical care resources.
NA,Because recovery from COVID-19 associated respiratory failure can be prolonged, tracheostomy may facilitate patient management and optimize use of mechanical ventilators.
NA,Several important considerations apply to planning tracheostomies for COVID-19 infected patients.
NA,After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggest an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure.
NA,As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted.
NA,Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy.
NA,The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolute necessary.
NA,Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff are exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment.
NA,An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment.
NA,Deep neuromuscular blockade (train of four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing.
NA,For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed.
NA,Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team.
NA,If possible after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of healthcare worker infection.Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high-risk for all members of the procedural team.
NA,To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.
NA,The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention.
NA,As of March 31, 2020, a total of 82,631 cases of COVID-19 in China were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China.
NA,Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.
NA,A total of 198 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 139 dates of infections were identified among 14,829 confirmed cases outside Hubei Province as reported as of March 31, 2020.
NA,Based on this information, we found that the serial interval had an average of 4.60 days with a standard deviation of 5.55 days, the incubation period had an average of 8.00 days with a standard deviation of 4.75 days and the infectious period had an average of 13.96 days with a standard deviation of 5.20 days.
NA,The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, R<sub>c</sub>, produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers R<sub>0</sub>.
NA,The controlled reproduction number in China is much lower than one in all regions of China by now.
NA,It fell below one within 30 days from the implementations of unprecedent containment measures, which indicates that the strong measures taken by China government was effective to contain the epidemic.
NA,Nonetheless, efforts are still needed in order to end the current epidemic as imported cases from overseas pose a high risk of a second outbreak.
NA,The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heralded a new era in the cross-species transmission of severe respiratory illness leading to rapid spread in mainland China and around the world with a case fatality rate of 2.3% in China and 1.8-7.2% outside China (Wu &amp; McGoogan, 2019; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Onder Rezza, &amp; Brusaferro, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020).
NA,As of May 15, 2020, a total of 4,338,658 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 297,119 death cases have been documented globally (World Health Organization, 2020).
NA,Several strategies have been adopted to contain the outbreak including classic infection-control and public health measures, nevertheless these measures may not be effective for tackling the scale of COVID-19.
NA,To use mathematical models to predict the epidemiological impact of lifting the lockdown in London, UK, and alternative strategies to help inform policy in the UK.
NA,A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London.
NA,The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital.
NA,We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19.
NA,Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread.
NA,While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths.
NA,However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown.
NA,In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown.
NA,This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone.
NA,A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections.
NA,This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.
NA,To describe the infection control strategy to achieve zero nosocomial transmission of symptomatic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 during the pre-pandemic phase (the first 72 days after announcement of pneumonia cases in Wuhan) in Hong Kong.
NA,Administrative support with the aim of zero nosocomial transmission by reducing elective clinical services, decanting wards, mobilizing isolation facilities, providing adequate personal protective equipment, coordinating laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnosis under 4-tier active surveillance for hospitalized- and out-patients, and organizing staff forum and training was implemented under the framework of preparedness plan in Hospital Authority.
NA,The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003.
NA,Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.
NA,Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak.
NA,The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p&lt;0.001).
NA,Administrative support to infection control could minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,We describe what we believe is the first instance of complete COVID-19 testing of all passengers and crew on an isolated cruise ship during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,Of the 217 passengers and crew on board, 128 tested positive for COVID-19 on reverse transcription-PCR (59%).
NA,Of the COVID-19-positive patients, 19% (24) were symptomatic; 6.2% (8) required medical evacuation; 3.1% (4) were intubated and ventilated; and the mortality was 0.8% (1).
NA,The majority of COVID-19-positive patients were asymptomatic (81%, 104 patients).
NA,We conclude that the prevalence of COVID-19 on affected cruise ships is likely to be significantly underestimated, and strategies are needed to assess and monitor all passengers to prevent community transmission after disembarkation.
NA,Considering the population density, healthcare capacity, limited resources and existing poverty, environmental factors, social structure, cultural norms, and already more than 18,863 people infected, the community transmission of COVID-19 is happening fast.
NA,These exacerbated a complex fear among the public.
NA,The aim of this article is, therefore, to understand the public perception of socioeconomic crisis and human stress in resource-limited settings of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,The sample comprised of 1066 Bangladeshi participants.
NA,Principal component analysis (PCA) was considered to design a standardized scale to measure the mental stress and socioeconomic crisis, one-way ANOVA and t-test were conducted to perceive different demographic risk groups; multiple linear regression was applied to estimate the statistically significant association between each component, and classical test theory (CTT) analysis was applied to examine the reliability of each item according to the components to develop a composite score.
NA,Without safeguarding the fundamental needs for the vulnerable ultra-poor group can undeniably cause the socioeconomic crisis and mental stress due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
NA,It has further created unemployment, deprivation, hunger, and social conflicts.
NA,The weak governance in the fragile healthcare system exacerbates the general public's anxiety as the COVID-19 testing facilities are centered around in the urban areas, a long serial to be tested, minimum or no treatment facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients are the chief observations hampered along with the disruption of other critical healthcare services.
NA,One-way ANOVA and t-test confirmed food and nutritional deficiency among the vulnerable poorest section due to loss of livelihood.
NA,Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed.
NA,Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak.
NA,Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested.
NA,Finally, this assessment process could help the government and policymakers to judge the public perceptions to deal with COVID-19 pandemic in densely populated lower-middle-income and limited-resource countries like Bangladesh.
NA,Since its initial outbreak in China, in December, 2019, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe.
NA,At the time of writing, on April 29, 2020, infections had been confirmed in more than 200 countries and regions and 3,018,681 infections and 207,973 deaths had been recorded.
NA,In Japan, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on January 16, 2020, since when, the number of domestic infections and the death toll have reached 13,852 and 389, respectively, representing exponential increases.
NA,Moreover, both domestically and internationally, the shortage of medical resources and the spread of infection among medical personnel, caused by nosocomial transmissions have become problematic.
NA,The pathology of COVID-19, including the exact infection route, remains largely unknown.
NA,Given the unavailability of an effective cure and vaccine, people are required to respond to this adversity without becoming complacent.
NA,The global efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing endeavors, far from over.
NA,New epidemiological data and clinical findings are emerging on a daily basis, making it critical to always refer to the latest information.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections has led to substantial unmet need for treatments, many of which will require testing in appropriate animal models of this disease.
NA,Vaccine trials are already underway, but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target SARS-CoV-2 or the complications arising from viral infection, particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe COVID-19.
NA,At the time of writing, in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described using macaques, cats, ferrets, hamsters, and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
NA,These infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity, but to date only partially model the mechanisms implicated in human severe COVID-19.
NA,There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
NA,These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease.
NA,Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.
NA,In January 2020, we identified two SARS-CoV-2 infections in a familial cluster with one person coming from Wuhan, China.
NA,The complete genome sequences of two SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from these patients were identical and 99.98% similar to strains isolated in Wuhan.
NA,This is genetically suggestive of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and indicates Wuhan as the most plausible origin of the early outbreak in Vietnam.
NA,The younger patient with a mild upper respiratory illness and a brief viral shedding, while the elderly with multi-morbidity had pneumonia, prolonged viral shedding, and residual lung damage.
NA,Evidence of nonsynonymous substitutions in the ORF1ab region of the viral sequence warrants further studies.

NA,SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly within months despite global public health strategies to curb transmission by testing symptomatic patients and encouraging social distancing.
NA,Here, we summarize rapidly emerging evidence highlighting transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.
NA,Viral load of asymptomatic carriers is comparable to symptomatic patients, viral shedding is highest before symptom onset suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms.
NA,Within universally tested subgroups, surprisingly high percentages of COVID-19 positive asymptomatic individuals were found.
NA,Asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters.
NA,A Wuhan study showed an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission, and several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than the general population.
NA,This raises concern that health workers could act as silent disease vectors.
NA,Therefore, current public health strategies relying solely on 'symptom onset' for infection identification need urgent reassessment.
NA,Extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients.
NA,Limited studies have been published on practices and management of COVID-19 in children.
NA,Despite the fact that COVID-19 rarely caused any severe disease in children, the asymptomatic children might be playing an important role for spreading COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.
NA,This review aimed at sharing our experience of how to handle patients with COVID-19 in a pediatric referral and tertiary care hospital to prevent the possible transmissions to the healthcare workers (HCWs).
NA,This review sought to identify infection control practices measures during COVID-19 pandemic comes from our daily practice combined with the most recent guidelines with the new experience and information.
NA,Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, four primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment.
NA,Infection control precautions to prevent the possible transmissions to HCWs as well as the other patients and their caregivers from children with COVID-19 are very critical.
NA,If sufficient precautions are not taken, healthcare settings may serve as additional source of transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the society.
NA,Due to the close relationship between the incidence of infectious diseases by epidemics and environmental conditions, this research explores the temperature, evaporation, precipitation and regional climate effects on the local transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside 31 states and capital of Mexico since February 29 (national onset) to March 31, 2020.
NA,Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations.
NA,In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state.
NA,The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables.
NA,The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR.
NA,The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant.
NA,The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 °C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset.
NA,However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 °C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate.
NA,The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 °C and 8.48 mm respectively).
NA,Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season.
NA,In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).
NA,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses major challenges for the entire medical care system.
NA,Especially in university institutions as maximum care providers, a higher exposure to potentially infectious patients or actual COVID19 patients is to be expected.
NA,In a short period of time, an operational concept had to be developed regarding the current hygiene recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the leading medical societies and the internal hospital hygiene plan.
NA,Here, patient safety and employee protection are equally important.In cooperation with the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene and the occupational medical service, interventions were defined to develop solutions to minimize the COVID-19 transmission risk for examiners and patients despite limited diagnostic and equipment resources.
NA,For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
NA,After the initial rollout and several &quot;hygiene inspections&quot; only minor improvements to the concept were necessary.
NA,All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.
NA,Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a dynamic process with regular changes in the development and information status, the operational concept is regularly reviewed for validity and adjusted as necessary.
NA,Die SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie stellt das gesamte medizinische Versorgungssystem vor große Herausforderungen.
NA,Gerade in universitären Einrichtungen als Maximalversorger ist eine höhere Exposition zu potenziell infektiösen Patienten oder tatsächlichen COVID-19-Kranken zu erwarten.
NA,Es musste kurzfristig ein Betriebskonzept entwickelt werden, das den aktuellen Hygiene-Empfehlungen des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI), den Empfehlungen der führenden Fachgesellschaften und dem daraus abgeleiteten internen Hygieneplan entsprach.
NA,Hierbei sind die Patientensicherheit und der Mitarbeiterschutz gleichermaßen zu beachten.In Zusammenarbeit mit dem Institut für Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Krankenhaushygiene sowie dem Betriebsärztlichen Dienst wurden Maßnahmen festgelegt, um trotz begrenzter diagnostischer und Ausrüstungsressourcen Lösungen zu erarbeiten, um die COVID-19-Übertragungsgefahr für Untersucher und Patienten zu minimieren.
NA,Hierzu wurde ein Betriebskonzept erarbeitet, das aus verschiedenen Einzelmaßnahmen bestand, wie z.
NA,B. der Reduktion der ambulanten Patientenbehandlung auf Notfälle, lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen und dringliche Nachsorgen, eine Doppeltriage von Patienten sowie die Einführung von Behandlungsteams.Das neue erarbeitete Betriebskonzept konnte erfolgreich innerhalb weniger Tage umgesetzt werden.
NA,Nach ersten Erfahrungen aus dem Realbetrieb und mehreren „Hygienebegehungen“ waren lediglich geringfügige Nachbesserungen des Konzeptes erforderlich.
NA,Alle Maßnahmen wurden schriftlich im klinikinternen Qualitätshandbuch dokumentiert und sind allen Mitarbeitern zugänglich.
NA,Da es sich bei der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie um einen dynamischen Prozess mit regelmäßiger Änderung des Entwicklungs- und Informationsstandes handelt, wird das Betriebskonzept regelmäßig neu auf Gültigkeit überprüft und ggf. angepasst.
NA,Pending the availability of vaccines to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the current solution is &quot;social distancing&quot; with a reduction of dental treatments to those assessed as urgent and emergency cases.
NA,These treatments also involve Early Childhood Caries (ECC) due to the fact that this disease affects preschool children (a vulnerable population) and, in addition, shows a propensity to evolve into more serious complications (dental pain, infections).
NA,A narrative review was carried out to support a protocol for treating ECC with efficacious and safe (in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission) procedures.
NA,Protocol involves criteria for patients' selection remotely (telemedicine), and well-detailed criteria/equipment and hygiene procedures to combat against SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care.
NA,MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments.
NA,For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment.
NA,The indications proposed in this protocol could support clinicians for the temporary management of ECC until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends.
NA,The major impact produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) focused many researchers attention to find treatments that can suppress transmission or ameliorate the disease.
NA,Despite the very fast and large flow of scientific data on possible treatment solutions, none have yet demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
NA,This work represents an exhaustive and critical review of all available data on potential treatments for COVID‑19, highlighting their mechanistic characteristics and the strategy development rationale.
NA,Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, and target based methods are the most used strategies to advance therapeutic solutions into clinical practice.
NA,Current in silico, in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding proposed treatments are summarized providing strong support for future research efforts.
NA,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a life-threatening pandemic.
NA,The epidemic trends in different countries vary considerably due to different policy-making and resources mobilization.
NA,We calculated basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproductive number (R<sub>t</sub>) of COVID-19 by using the maximum likelihood method and the sequential Bayesian method, respectively.
NA,European and North American countries possessed higher R<sub>0</sub> and unsteady R<sub>t</sub> fluctuations, whereas some heavily affected Asian countries showed relatively low R<sub>0</sub> and declining R<sub>t</sub> now.
NA,The numbers of patients in Africa and Latin America are still low, but the potential risk of huge outbreaks cannot be ignored.
NA,Three scenarios were then simulated, generating distinct outcomes by using SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model.
NA,First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing R<sub>t</sub>.
NA,Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation.
NA,Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life.
NA,Our mathematical modeling provides evidence for international communities to develop sound design of containment and mitigation policies for COVID-19.
NA,The scarcity of facemasks, particularly N95 respirators, combined with the lack of solid data to address the suitability of each mask type for adequate health care worker (HCW) protection have caused turmoil among HCWs.
NA,Current recommendations suggest mask usage solely during HCW contact with Covid-19 patients, namely plain medical mask for low-risk contacts and N95 for aerosol generating procedures.
NA,The distinction regarding the escalation of mask complexity depending on contact type is nevertheless based on plausible theoretical assumptions rather than hard evidence of a clear benefit.
NA,Conversely, we suggest that at least a plain mask should be used during all HCWs' contacts in healthcare facilities which constitute a highly probable but often overlooked means of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs.
NA,The pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19) hit India recently; and the associated uncertainty is increasingly testing psychological resilience of the masses.
NA,When the global focus has mostly been on testing, finding a cure and preventing transmission; people are going through a myriad of psychological problems in adjusting to the current lifestyles and fear of the disease.
NA,Since there is a severe dearth of researches on this issue, we decided to conduct an online survey to evaluate its psychological impact.
NA,From 26th to 29th March an online survey (FEEL-COVID) was conducted using principles of snowballing, and by invitation through text messages to participate.
NA,The survey collected data on socio-demographic and clinical variables related to COVID-19 (based on the current knowledge); along with measuring psychological impact with the help of Impact of Event-revised (IES-R) scale.
NA,There were a total of 1106 responses from around 64 cities in the country.
NA,Out of these 453 responses had at least one item missing; and were excluded from the analysis.
NA,The mean age of the respondents was around 41 years with a male female ratio of 3:1 and around 22% respondents were health care professionals.
NA,Overall approximately one third of respondents had significant psychological impact (IES-R score &gt; 24).
NA,Higher psychological impact was predicted with younger age, female gender and comorbid physical illness.
NA,Presence of physical symptoms and contact history predicted higher psychological impact, but did not reach statistical significance.
NA,During the initial stages of COVID-19 in India, almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact.
NA,This indicates a need for more systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs of the population, which can help the government in formulating holistic interventions for affected individuals.
NA,To model the effects of continuous, intermittent, and stepping-down social distancing (SD) strategies and personal protection measures on COVID-19 transmission dynamics.
NA,Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %).
NA,The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths.
NA,The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy.
NA,An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window.
NA,However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).
NA,If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
NA,Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
NA,According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.
NA,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and its subsequent global spread, Taiwan has been combatting this pandemic.
NA,COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
NA,As SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, we cannot ignore the risk of transmission during hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
NA,Our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center prioritizes preventing the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining operation for the patients during the pandemic.
NA,The aim of this article is to share the protocol that we have adopted in our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
NA,The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached over five million confirmed cases worldwide, and numbers are still growing at a fast rate.
NA,Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions.
NA,In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future.
NA,While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown.
NA,Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies.
NA,We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals.
NA,We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.
NA,A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was recently identified as the causative agent for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that has generated a global health crisis.
NA,We use a combination of genomic analysis and sensitive profile-based sequence and structure analysis to understand the potential pathogenesis determinants of this virus.
NA,As a result, we identify several fast-evolving genomic regions that might be at the interface of virus-host interactions, corresponding to the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, the three tandem Macro fold domains in ORF1a, and the uncharacterized protein ORF8.
NA,Further, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-CoVs belong to novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins.
NA,Among them, ORF8 is distinguished by being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert, and having a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove.
NA,We also uncover numerous Ig domain proteins from several unrelated metazoan viruses, which are distinct in sequence and structure but share comparable architectures to those of the CoV Ig domain proteins.
NA,Hence, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and other previously unidentified CoV Ig domain proteins fall under the umbrella of a widespread strategy of deployment of Ig domain proteins in animal viruses as pathogenicity factors that modulate host immunity.
NA,The rapid evolution of the ORF8 Ig domain proteins points to a potential evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts, likely arising from immune pressure, and suggests a role in transmission between distinct host species.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strongly emphasizes the need for a more complete understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of its causative agent SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Despite intense scrutiny, several proteins encoded by the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses remain enigmatic.
NA,Moreover, the high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals make wet-lab studies currently challenging.
NA,In this study, we used a series of computational strategies to identify several fast-evolving regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which are potentially under host immune pressure.
NA,Most notably, the hitherto-uncharacterized protein encoded by ORF8 is one of them.
NA,Using sensitive sequence and structural analysis methods, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-coronavirus comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential immune modulators to delay or attenuate the host immune response against the viruses.
NA,New York City (NYC) has emerged as one of the epicenters of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
NA,To identify the early transmission events underlying the rapid spread of the virus in the NYC metropolitan area, we sequenced the virus causing COVID-19 in patients seeking care at the Mount Sinai Health System.
NA,Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States.
NA,Moreover, we find evidence for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different neighborhoods of the city.
NA,Understanding the particle size distribution in the air and patterns of environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for infection prevention policies.
NA,Here we screen surface and air samples from hospital rooms of COVID-19 patients for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
NA,Environmental sampling is conducted in three airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the general ward. 245 surface samples are collected.
NA,56.7% of rooms have at least one environmental surface contaminated.
NA,High touch surface contamination is shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p = 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup> test).
NA,Air sampling is performed in three of the 27 AIIRs in the general ward, and detects SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles of sizes &gt;4 µm and 1-4 µm in two rooms, despite these rooms having 12 air changes per hour.
NA,This warrants further study of the airborne transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,To examine a cohort of children and adolescents quarantined during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in India and to describe their understanding of, compliance with and the psychological impact of quarantine experience.
NA,One hundred twenty one children and adolescents along with their parents were interviewed regarding their compliance and psychological distress during the quarantine period.
NA,A comparable data was also obtained from 131 children and adolescents who were not quarantined.
NA,Most of the children and adolescents were non-compliant as compliance with all requirements was low (7.43%), though compliance with community protective measures (17.35%) was better than compliance with household protective measures (10.71%).
NA,Quarantined children and adolescents experienced greater psychological distress than non-quarantined children and adolescents (p ˂0.001).
NA,Worry (68.59%), helplessness (66.11%) and fear (61.98%) were the most common feelings experienced under quarantine.
NA,The low compliance with quarantine requirements as seen in this study raises a serious concern about the effectiveness of quarantine as a preventive measure of disease transmission.
NA,Compliance and mental health problems can be improved by providing adequate financial support and enhanced knowledge about pandemic planning.
NA,The global pandemic of respiratory disease cause by the novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused untold suffering, loss of life and upheaval in society.
NA,The pandemic has lead to massive redirection of health care resources to treat the surge of COVID-19 patients, and enforcement of social distancing to reduce the rate of transmission.
NA,Editorial Board members provided observations of the implications of the pandemic on academic surgical oncology.
NA,Delivery of health care to other populations including cancer patients has been significantly disrupted.
NA,The implications both short term and long term threaten preservation of the academic mission in medicine at large, and certainly in the field of surgical oncology.
NA,The effects on surgical oncology training, research and clinical trials are major.
NA,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium-to-large sized respiratory droplets although airborne transmission is theoretically possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures.
NA,Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage.
NA,However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19.
NA,We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model.
NA,We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naïve hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator.
NA,The effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated.
NA,Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression.
NA,Non-contact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naïve hamsters.
NA,Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naïve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018).
NA,Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P=0.019) of exposed naïve hamsters.
NA,Unlike the severe COVID-19 manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naïve hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues.
NA,SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei in the hamster model.
NA,Such transmission could be reduced by surgical mask usage, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.
NA,COVID-19 poses a risk to the endoscopic skull base surgeon.
NA,Significant efforts to improving safety have been employed, including the use of personal protective equipment, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and recently the use of a modified surgical mask barrier.
NA,To reduce the risks of pathogen transmission during endoscopic skull base surgery.
NA,This study was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval.
NA,Our study utilizes a 3-dimensional (3D)-printed mask with an anterior aperture fitted with a surgical glove with ports designed to allow for surgical instrumentation and side ports to accommodate suction ventilation and an endotracheal tube.
NA,As an alternative, a modified laparoscopic surgery trocar served as a port for instruments, and, on the contralateral side, rubber tubing was used over the endoscrub endosheath to create an airtight seal.
NA,Surgical freedom and aerosolization were tested in both modalities.
NA,The ventilated mask allowed for excellent surgical maneuverability and freedom.
NA,The trocar system was effective for posterior surgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures, and afforded a superior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches.
NA,Aerosolization was reduced using both the mask and nasal trocar.
NA,The ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a critical role in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era.
NA,The nasal trocar may be a useful alternative in instances where 3D printing is not available.
NA,Additional studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings.
NA,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as one of the most compelling and concerning public health challenges of our time.
NA,To address the myriad issues generated by this pandemic, an interdisciplinary breadth of research, clinical and public health communities has rapidly engaged to collectively find answers and solutions.
NA,One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
NA,Although respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are likely.
NA,Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk.
NA,However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding.
NA,Results of the literature search reported here (finalized on 17 April 2020) revealed a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E; a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative); and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk.
NA,We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; one study (a non-peer-reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in milk.
NA,Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk.
NA,These reports are evaluated here, and their implications related to the possibility of vertical transmission of coronaviruses (in particular, SARS-CoV-2) during breastfeeding are discussed.
NA,Coronavírus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a virus of mass dissemination, with an impact on international public health, leading to hospitalizations and death.
NA,The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough; however, myalgia and dyspnea and the transmission routes include direct transmission by cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation, or contact transmission with the oral, nasal, or eye mucous membranes.
NA,The dental professionals are the main risk group to COVID-19 due to the transmission routes that are directly related to the dental practice.
NA,In addition, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) are even more exposed, due to increased contact with the population in hospitals and emergency services.
NA,OMFS should be able to identify a suspected case of COVID-19, its symptoms, risk groups, disease severity, laboratorial and computed tomography alterations, and treatment guidelines.
NA,In the present study, the authors performed a nationwide survey with Brazilian OMFS to evaluate the knowledge of these professionals about the pandemic status of the COVID-19.
NA,A total of 142 OMFS replied the survey and the results brings light to an incomparable health public problem that the OMFS in Brazil are no able to protect itself, diagnose the suspicious and probable cases, request and interpret the correct laboratorial examinations for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients.
NA,Previous reports have suggested that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by higher temperatures and higher humidity.
NA,We analyzed case-data from the United States to investigate effects of temperature, precipitation, and UV Light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
NA,Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 01/22/2020 to 04/03/2020 were analyzed.
NA,We used negative binomial regression modelling to investigate whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV Index and the incidence 5 days later were related.
NA,We performed sensitivity analyses at 3 days, 7 days and 9 days to assess transmission lags.
NA,A maximum temperature greater than 52°F on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days[IRR: 0.85(0.76,0.96)p=0.009].
NA,Among observations with daily temperatures below 52°F, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.97,0.99)p=0.001].
NA,The rate of new cases was predicted to be lower for theoretical states that maintained a stable maximum daily temperature above 52°F with a predicted 23-fewer cases per-million per-day by 25 days of the epidemic.
NA,A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days [IRR 0.97(0.95,0.99)p=0.004].
NA,Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.89,1.08)p=0.65].
NA,The incidence of disease declines with increasing temperature up until 52°F and is lower at warmer versus cooler temperatures.
NA,However, the association between temperature and transmission is small and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.
NA,Following the rapid dissemination of COVID-19 cases in Switzerland, large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented by the cantons and the federal government between 28 February and 20 March 2020.
NA,Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks.
NA,We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs.
NA,We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics.
NA,We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths.
NA,We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1&amp;ndash;3.8) at the beginning of the epidemic.
NA,Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79&amp;ndash;90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3&amp;ndash;0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April.
NA,At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%.
NA,Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs.
NA,We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission.
NA,As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising.
NA,However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&amp;ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
NA,These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.
NA,The COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health crisis worldwide.
NA,Dental professionals are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to occupational hazard associated with aerosol generating dental procedures (Ge et al., 2020).
NA,In this commentary, we share the perspectives of dentists practicing in private practice and clinician-researchers in academic dental institutions.
NA,More specifically, we discuss about measures implemented to minimize risks of disease transmission, challenges in emergency dental care, impact on patients, and on private practice and academic dental team.
NA,From first cases reported on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei-China, SARS-CoV2 has spread worldwide and finally the World Health Organization declared the pandemic status.
NA,We summarize what makes SARS-CoV2 different from previous highly pathogenic coronaviruses and why it is so contagious, with focus on its clinical presentation and diagnosis, which is mandatory to start the appropriate management and reduce the transmission.
NA,As far as infection pathophysiology is still not completely clarified, this review focuses also on the cardiovascular (CV) implication of COVID-19 and the capability of this virus to cause direct myocardial injury, myocarditis and other CV manifestations.
NA,Furthermore, we highlight the relationship between the virus, enzyme ACE2 and ACE inhibitors.
NA,Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
NA,Aim of this review is then to summarize what is actually known about the SARS-CoV2 and its cardiovascular implications.
NA,The coronavirus disease pandemic has affected our practice as healthcare professionals (HCP).
NA,As burn surgeons, we are obliged to provide the best possible care to our patients.
NA,However, due to the risk of viral transmission, the goal should be to provide safe care to our patients as well as ensure the safety of the whole team providing burn care.
NA,The burn patients are usually debilitated and require a prolonged hospital stay and multiple operative procedures which puts them and everyone involved in their care at increased risk of coronavirus infections and transmission.
NA,This warrants special caution to the burn team while managing such patients.
NA,In this review, we aim to highlight the key considerations for burn care teams while dealing with burn patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NA,The outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported from China, and on February 19, 2020, the first case was confirmed in Qom, Iran.
NA,The basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of infection is variable in different populations and periods.
NA,The present study aimed to estimate the R<sub>0</sub> of COVID-19 in Qom, Iran and compare it with other countries.
NA,For estimation of the serial interval, we used data of the 51 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their 318 close contacts in the Qom, Iran.
NA,The daily number of confirmed cases in the early phase of the outbreak and estimated serial interval were used for R<sub>0</sub> estimation.
NA,We used the time-varying method as a method with the least bias to estimate R<sub>0</sub> in Qom, Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea.
NA,The serial interval was estimated with gamma distribution, mean of 4.55 days and a standard deviation of 3.30 days for the COVID-19 epidemic based on Qom data.
NA,The number of R<sub>0</sub> in the present study was estimated to be between 2 and 3 in Qom.
NA,Of the four countries studied, the lowest R<sub>0</sub> was estimated for South Korea (1.5-2) and the highest for Iran (4-5).
NA,Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R<sub>0</sub> is sensitive to the applied mean generation time.
NA,To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to estimate R<sub>0</sub> number in Qom.
NA,To control the epidemic, the number of reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the contact rate, decreasing transmission probability and decreasing the duration of the infectious period.
NA,Bats harbor diverse coronaviruses (CoVs), some of which are associated with zoonotic infections, as well as interspecies transmission.
NA,In this study, a total of 512 bat fecal samples from the bat habitats at different geographical locations in South Korea were investigated between 2016 and 2019.
NA,Seventy-eight samples were positive for coronaviruses (15.2%), comprising 68 alphacoronaviruses (13.3%) and 10 betacoronaviruses (2.0%).
NA,The positive rates tended to increase during the awakening-(April) period.
NA,Notably, betacoronaviruses were only found in the site where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was the major species of bats, and were related to SARS- and MERS-related CoVs identified in China and South Korea, respectively.
NA,No betacoronaviruses were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in this study.
NA,Alphacoronaviruses were detected in the sites where Hypsugo alaschanicus, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis bombinus, Myotis macrodactylus, and Myotis petax were found to be the major bat species.
NA,Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses, and had a wider distribution in Korea.
NA,Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species.
NA,Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co-roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats.
NA,The many variations on a graphic illustrating the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures to mitigate pandemic influenza that have appeared in recent news reports about COVID-19 suggest a need to better explain the mechanism by which social distancing reduces the spread of infectious diseases.
NA,And some reports understate one benefit of reducing the frequency or proximity of interpersonal encounters, a reduction in the total number of infections.
NA,In hopes that understanding will increase compliance, we describe how social distancing a) reduces the peak incidence of infections, b) delays the occurrence of this peak, and c) reduces the total number of infections during epidemics.
NA,In view of the extraordinary efforts underway to identify existing medications that are active against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies, any of which may have community-level effects, we also describe how pharmaceutical interventions affect transmission.
